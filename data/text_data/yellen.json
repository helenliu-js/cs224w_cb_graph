    "text": "For release on delivery\n12:20 p.m. EDT\nMarch 29, 2016\nThe Outlook, Uncertainty, and Monetary Policy\nRemarks by\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Economic Club of New York\nNew York, New York\nMarch 29, 2016\n\nFor more than a century, the Economic Club of New York has served as one of\nthe nation’s leading nonpartisan forums for discussion of economic policy issues. It is an\nhonor to appear before you today to speak about the Federal Reserve’s pursuit of\nmaximum employment and price stability.\nIn December, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised the target\nrange for the federal funds rate, the Federal Reserve’s main policy rate, by 1/4 percentage\npoint. This small step marked the end of an extraordinary seven-year period during\nwhich the federal funds rate was held near zero to support the recovery from the worst\nfinancial crisis and recession since the Great Depression. The Committee’s action\nrecognized the considerable progress that the U.S. economy had made in restoring the\njobs and incomes of millions of Americans hurt by this downturn. It also reflected an\nexpectation that the economy would continue to strengthen and that inflation, while low,\nwould move up to the FOMC’s 2 percent objective as the transitory influences of lower\noil prices and a stronger dollar gradually dissipate and as the labor market improves\nfurther. In light of this expectation, the Committee stated in December, and reiterated at\nthe two subsequent meetings, that it “expects that economic conditions will evolve in a\nmanner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate.”1\nIn my remarks today, I will explain why the Committee anticipates that only\ngradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted in coming years,\nemphasizing that this guidance should be understood as a forecast for the trajectory of\npolicy rates that the Committee anticipates will prove to be appropriate to achieve its\nobjectives, conditional on the outlook for real economic activity and inflation.\n1 Board of Governors (2015), paragraph 4.\n\n- 2 -\nImportantly, this forecast is not a plan set in stone that will be carried out regardless of\neconomic developments. Instead, monetary policy will, as always, respond to the\neconomy’s twists and turns so as to promote, as best as we can in an uncertain economic\nenvironment, the employment and inflation goals assigned to us by the Congress.\nThe proviso that policy will evolve as needed is especially pertinent today in light\nof global economic and financial developments since December, which at times have\nincluded significant changes in oil prices, interest rates, and stock values. So far, these\ndevelopments have not materially altered the Committee’s baseline--or most likely--\noutlook for economic activity and inflation over the medium term. Specifically, we\ncontinue to expect further labor market improvement and a return of inflation to our\n2 percent objective over the next two or three years, consistent with data over recent\nmonths. But this is not to say that global developments since the turn of the year have\nbeen inconsequential. In part, the baseline outlook for real activity and inflation is little\nchanged because investors responded to those developments by marking down their\nexpectations for the future path of the federal funds rate, thereby putting downward\npressure on longer-term interest rates and cushioning the adverse effects on economic\nactivity. In addition, global developments have increased the risks associated with that\noutlook. In light of these considerations, the Committee decided to leave the stance of\npolicy unchanged in both January and March.\nI will next describe the Committee’s baseline economic outlook and the risks that\ncloud that outlook, emphasizing the FOMC’s commitment to adjust monetary policy as\nneeded to achieve our employment and inflation objectives.\n\n- 3 -\nRecent Developments and the Baseline Outlook\nReadings on the U.S. economy since the turn of the year have been somewhat\nmixed. On the one hand, many indicators have been quite favorable. The labor market\nhas added an average of almost 230,000 jobs a month over the past three months. In\naddition, the unemployment rate has edged down further, more people are joining the\nworkforce as the prospects for finding jobs have improved, and the employment-to-\npopulation ratio has increased by almost 1/2 percentage point. Consumer spending\nappears to be expanding at a moderate pace, driven by solid income gains, improved\nhousehold balance sheets, and the ongoing effects of the increases in wealth and declines\nin oil prices over the past few years. The housing market continues its gradual recovery,\nand fiscal policy at all levels of government is now modestly boosting economic activity\nafter exerting a considerable drag in recent years.\nOn the other hand, manufacturing and net exports have continued to be hard hit\nby slow global growth and the significant appreciation of the dollar since 2014. These\nsame global developments have also weighed on business investment by limiting firms’\nexpected sales, thereby reducing their demand for capital goods; partly as a result, recent\nindicators of capital spending and business sentiment have been lackluster. In addition,\nbusiness investment has been held down by the collapse in oil prices since late 2014,\nwhich is driving an ongoing steep decline in drilling activity. Low oil prices have also\nresulted in large-scale layoffs in the energy sector and adverse spillovers to output and\nemployment in industries that support energy production.\nOn balance, overall employment has continued to grow at a solid pace so far this\nyear, in part because domestic household spending has been sufficiently strong to offset\n\n- 4 -\nthe drag coming from abroad. Looking forward however, we have to take into account\nthe potential fallout from recent global economic and financial developments, which have\nbeen marked by bouts of turbulence since the turn of the year. For a time, equity prices\nwere down sharply, oil traded at less than $30 per barrel, and many currencies were\ndepreciating against the dollar. Although prices in these markets have since largely\nreturned to where they stood at the start of the year, in other respects economic and\nfinancial conditions remain less favorable than they did back at the time of the December\nFOMC meeting. In particular, foreign economic growth now seems likely to be weaker\nthis year than previously expected, and earnings expectations have declined. By\nthemselves, these developments would tend to restrain U.S. economic activity. But those\neffects have been at least partially offset by downward revisions to market expectations\nfor the federal funds rate that in turn have put downward pressure on longer-term interest\nrates, including mortgage rates, thereby helping to support spending. For these reasons, I\nanticipate that the overall fallout for the U.S. economy from global market developments\nsince the start of the year will most likely be limited, although this assessment is subject\nto considerable uncertainty.\nAll told, the Committee continues to expect moderate economic growth over the\nmedium term accompanied by further labor market improvement. Consistent with this\nassessment, the medians of the individual projections for economic growth,\nunemployment, and inflation made by all of the FOMC participants for our March\nmeeting are little changed from December.2 A key factor underlying such modest\n2 Specifically, the median projections of real GDP growth in 2016 and 2017 revised down 0.2 percentage\npoint and 0.1 percentage point, respectively; the median projections of real GDP growth in 2018 and the\nlonger run were unrevised. The median projection for the unemployment rate in late 2016 was unrevised,\nwhile the projections for late 2017, late 2018, and the longer run were revised down slightly. Finally,\n\n- 5 -\nrevisions is a judgment that monetary policy remains accommodative and will be\nadjusted at an appropriately gradual pace to achieve and maintain our dual objectives of\nmaximum employment and 2 percent inflation. Reflecting global economic and financial\ndevelopments since December, however, the pace of rate increases is now expected to be\nsomewhat slower. For example, the median of FOMC participants’ projections for the\nfederal funds rate is now only 0.9 percent for the end of 2016 and 1.9 percent for the end\nof 2017, both 1/2 percentage point below the December medians.\nAs has been widely discussed, the level of inflation-adjusted or real interest rates\nneeded to keep the economy near full employment appears to have fallen to a low level in\nrecent years. Although estimates vary both quantitatively and conceptually, the evidence\non balance indicates that the economy’s “neutral” real rate--that is, the level of the real\nfederal funds rate that would be neither expansionary nor contractionary if the economy\nwas operating near its potential--is likely now close to zero.3 However, the current real\nfederal funds rate is even lower, at roughly minus 1-1/4 percentage point, when measured\nusing the 12-month change in the core price index for personal consumption expenditures\nalthough the median projection for overall inflation in 2016 was revised down 0.4 percentage point, median\nprojections for subsequent years were unrevised; in addition, median projections for core inflation were\nalmost unrevised for all years. For additional information on the Summary of Economic Projections to be\nreleased with the March 2016 FOMC minutes, see\nwww.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20160316.htm.\n3 The neutral rate is not directly observable. However, we intuitively know that it must have run well\nbelow its historical norm in recent years because otherwise the economy would have expanded at a much\nmore rapid pace with the nominal federal funds rate near zero. As discussed in my December 2, 2015,\nspeech to the Economic Club of Washington (Yellen, 2015), empirical evidence supports this intuition. I\nshowed that model-based estimates of the “natural rate,” when the natural rate is defined as the real short-\nterm interest rate that would prevail in the absence of frictions that slow the adjustment of wages and prices\nto changes in the economy, are currently close to zero in four macroeconomic models used by Federal\nReserve staff. Time series estimates of a different concept of the natural rate that is more similar to the\nneutral rate definition used in this speech, such as Laubach and Williams (2016) and Lubik and Matthes\n(2015), are near historical lows. See also Johannsen and Mertens (2016) for empirical evidence of a\ndecline in the longer-run level of the natural rate, along with measures of the uncertainty attached to\nestimates of its current value.\n\n- 6 -\n(PCE), which excludes food and energy. Thus, the current stance of monetary policy\nappears to be consistent with actual economic growth modestly outpacing potential\ngrowth and further improvements in the labor market.4\nLooking beyond the near term, I anticipate that growth will also be supported by a\nlessening of some of the headwinds that continue to restrain the U.S. economy, which\ninclude weak foreign activity, dollar appreciation, a pace of household formation that has\nnot kept up with population and income growth and so has depressed homebuilding, and\nproductivity growth that has been running at a slow pace by historical standards since the\nend of the recession. If these headwinds gradually fade as I expect, the neutral federal\nfunds rate will also rise, in which case it will, all else equal, be appropriate to gradually\nincrease the federal funds rate more or less in tandem to achieve our dual objectives.\nOtherwise, monetary policy would eventually become overly accommodative as the\neconomy strengthened.5\nImplicitly, this expectation of fading headwinds and a rising neutral rate is a key\nreason for the FOMC’s assessment that gradual increases in the federal funds rate over\ntime will likely be appropriate. That said, this assessment is only a forecast. The future\npath of the federal funds rate is necessarily uncertain because economic activity and\ninflation will likely evolve in unexpected ways. For example, no one can be certain\nabout the pace at which economic headwinds will fade. More generally, the economy\n4 Assuming that the current gap between the actual federal funds rate and its neutral value is about\n125 basis points, simulations of the FRB/US model under vector-autoregression-based expectations suggest\nthat maintaining this interest rate gap for the next couple of years would lower the unemployment rate\n1/2 percentage point or so below what it otherwise would be if the gap were instead immediately closed.\nUnder rational expectations, the predicted effect would be smaller. For further information, see Brayton,\nLaubach, and Reifschneider (2014).\n5 Of course, any gap between the real federal funds rate and the neutral rate will eventually need to be\nclosed in order to stabilize inflation at 2 percent, keep employment at its maximum level, and the economy\ngrowing in line with its potential rate.\n\n- 7 -\nwill inevitably be buffeted by shocks that cannot be foreseen. What is certain, however,\nis that the Committee will respond to changes in the outlook as needed to achieve its dual\nmandate.\nTurning to inflation, here too the baseline outlook is little changed. In December,\nthe FOMC anticipated that inflation would remain low in the near term due to the drag\nfrom lower prices for energy and imports. But as those transitory effects faded, the\nCommittee expected inflation to move up to 2 percent over the medium term, provided\nthe labor market improves further and inflation expectations are stable. This assessment\nstill seems to me to be broadly correct. PCE prices were up only 1 percent in February\nrelative to a year earlier, held down by earlier declines in the price of oil. In contrast,\ncore PCE inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy components, was up 1.7\npercent in February on a 12 month basis, somewhat more than my expectation in\nDecember. But it is too early to tell if this recent faster pace will prove durable. Even\nwhen measured on a 12-month basis, core inflation can vary substantially from quarter to\nquarter and earlier dollar appreciation is still expected to weigh on consumer prices in the\ncoming months. For these reasons, I continue to expect that overall PCE inflation for\n2016 as a whole will come in well below 2 percent but will then move back to 2 percent\nover the course of 2017 and 2018, assuming no further swings in energy prices or the\ndollar. This projection, however, depends critically on expectations for future inflation\nremaining reasonably well anchored. It is still my judgment that inflation expectations\nare well anchored, but as I will shortly discuss, continued low readings for some\nindicators of expected inflation do concern me.\n\n- 8 -\nRisks to the Outlook for Real Economic Activity\nAlthough the baseline outlook has changed little on balance since December,\nglobal developments pose ongoing risks. These risks appear to have contributed to the\nfinancial market volatility witnessed both last summer and in recent months.\nOne concern pertains to the pace of global growth, which is importantly\ninfluenced by developments in China. There is a consensus that China’s economy will\nslow in the coming years as it transitions away from investment toward consumption and\nfrom exports toward domestic sources of growth. There is much uncertainty, however,\nabout how smoothly this transition will proceed and about the policy framework in place\nto manage any financial disruptions that might accompany it. These uncertainties were\nheightened by market confusion earlier this year over China’s exchange rate policy.\nA second concern relates to the prospects for commodity prices, particularly oil.\nFor the United States, low oil prices, on net, likely will boost spending and economic\nactivity over the next few years because we are still a major oil importer. But the\napparent negative reaction of financial markets to recent declines in oil prices may in part\nreflect market concern that the price of oil was nearing a financial tipping point for some\ncountries and energy firms. In the case of countries reliant on oil exports, the result\nmight be a sharp cutback in government spending; for energy-related firms, it could entail\nsignificant financial strains and increased layoffs. In the event oil prices were to fall\nagain, either development could have adverse spillover effects to the rest of the global\neconomy.\nIf such downside risks to the outlook were to materialize, they would likely slow\nU.S. economic activity, at least to some extent, both directly and through financial market\n\n- 9 -\nchannels as investors respond by demanding higher returns to hold risky assets, causing\nfinancial conditions to tighten. But at the same time, we should not ignore the welcome\npossibility that economic conditions could turn out to be more favorable than we now\nexpect. The improvement in the labor market in 2014 and 2015 was considerably faster\nthan expected by either FOMC participants or private forecasters, and that experience\ncould be repeated if, for example, the economic headwinds we face were to abate more\nquickly than anticipated. For these reasons, the FOMC must watch carefully for signs\nthat the economy may be evolving in unexpected ways, good or bad.\nRisks to the Inflation Outlook\nThe inflation outlook has also become somewhat more uncertain since the turn of\nthe year, in part for reasons related to risks to the outlook for economic growth. To the\nextent that recent financial market turbulence signals an increased chance of a further\nslowing of growth abroad, oil prices could resume falling, and the dollar could start rising\nagain. And if foreign developments were to adversely affect the U.S. economy by more\nthan I expect, then the pace of labor market improvement would probably be slower,\nwhich would also tend to restrain growth in both wages and prices. But even if such\ndevelopments were to occur, they would, in my view, only delay the return of inflation to\n2 percent, provided that inflation expectations remain anchored.\nUnfortunately, the stability of longer-run inflation expectations cannot be taken\nfor granted. During the 1970s, inflation expectations rose markedly because the Federal\nReserve allowed actual inflation to ratchet up persistently in response to economic\ndisruptions--a development that made it more difficult to stabilize both inflation and\nemployment. With considerable effort, however, the FOMC gradually succeeded in\n\n- 10 -\nbringing inflation back down to a low and stable level over the course of the 1980s and\nearly 1990s. Since this time, measures of longer-run inflation expectations derived from\nboth surveys and financial markets have been remarkably stable, making it easier to keep\nactual inflation relatively close to 2 percent despite large movements in oil prices and\npronounced swings in the unemployment rate.\nLately, however, there have been signs that inflation expectations may have\ndrifted down. Market-based measures of longer-run inflation compensation have fallen\nmarkedly over the past year and half, although they have recently moved up modestly\nfrom their all-time lows. Similarly, the measure of longer-run inflation expectations\nreported in the University of Michigan Survey of Consumers has drifted down somewhat\nover the past few years and now stands at the lower end of the narrow range in which it\nhas fluctuated since the late 1990s.\nThe shifts in these measures notwithstanding, the argument that inflation\nexpectations have actually fallen is far from conclusive. Analysis carried out at the Fed\nand elsewhere suggests that the decline in market-based measures of inflation\ncompensation has largely been driven by movements in inflation risk premiums and\nliquidity concerns rather than by shifts in inflation expectations.6 In addition, the longer-\nrun measure of inflation expectations from the Michigan Survey has historically\nexhibited some sensitivity to fluctuations in current gasoline prices, which suggests that\nthis measure may be an unreliable guide to movements in trend inflation under current\ncircumstances.7 Moreover, measures of longer-run expected inflation gleaned from\n6 For related background discussions, see Bauer and Rudebusch (2015), Abrahams and others (2012 [rev.\n2015), and D’Amico, Kim, and Wei (2014).\n7 Similarly, a monthly survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows a noticeable\ndecline over the past two years in household expectations for inflation three years ahead. However, these\n\n- 11 -\nsurveys of business and financial economists, such as those reported in the Survey of\nProfessional Forecasters, the Blue Chip survey, and the Survey of Primary Dealers, have\nlargely moved sideways in the past year or two. Taken together, these results suggest\nthat my baseline assumption of stable expectations is still justified. Nevertheless, the\ndecline in some indicators has heightened the risk that this judgment could be wrong. If\nso, the return to 2 percent inflation could take longer than expected and might require a\nmore accommodative stance of monetary policy than would otherwise be appropriate.8\nDespite the declines in some indicators of expected inflation, we also need to\nconsider the opposite risk that we are underestimating the speed at which inflation will\nreturn to our 2 percent objective. Economic growth here and abroad could turn out to be\nstronger than expected, and, as the past few weeks have demonstrated, oil prices can rise\nas well as fall. More generally, economists’ understanding of inflation is far from\nperfect, and it would not be all that surprising if inflation was to rise more quickly than\nexpected over the next several years. For these reasons, we must continue to monitor\nincoming wage and price data carefully.\nMonetary Policy Implications\nLet me now turn to the implications for monetary policy of this assessment of the\nbaseline outlook and associated risks.\nreadings on shorter-term expectations may also be influenced by current gasoline prices. Moreover,\nreadings from this survey are only available since 2013, making it difficult to determine the significance of\nthese results.\n8 Another risk to the inflation forecast, although one that has not changed appreciably since the turn of the\nyear, is that the Committee may have overestimated the longer-run rate of unemployment consistent with\ninflation stabilizing at 2 percent. Currently, the median of FOMC participants’ estimates of this rate is\n4.8 percent. However, this longer-run rate cannot be estimated precisely, and so it could be appreciably\nhigher or lower--although given low readings on wages in recent years, I think the latter possibility is more\nlikely than the former. If so, a lower level of unemployment might be needed to fully eliminate slack in the\nlabor market, drive faster wage growth, and return inflation to our 2 percent objective.\n\n- 12 -\nThe FOMC left the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged in January\nand March, in large part reflecting the changes in baseline conditions that I noted earlier.\nIn particular, developments abroad imply that meeting our objectives for employment and\ninflation will likely require a somewhat lower path for the federal funds rate than was\nanticipated in December.\nGiven the risks to the outlook, I consider it appropriate for the Committee to\nproceed cautiously in adjusting policy. This caution is especially warranted because,\nwith the federal funds rate so low, the FOMC’s ability to use conventional monetary\npolicy to respond to economic disturbances is asymmetric. If economic conditions were\nto strengthen considerably more than currently expected, the FOMC could readily raise\nits target range for the federal funds rate to stabilize the economy. By contrast, if the\nexpansion was to falter or if inflation was to remain stubbornly low, the FOMC would be\nable to provide only a modest degree of additional stimulus by cutting the federal funds\nrate back to near zero.9\nOne must be careful, however, not to overstate the asymmetries affecting\nmonetary policy at the moment. Even if the federal funds rate were to return to near zero,\nthe FOMC would still have considerable scope to provide additional accommodation. In\nparticular, we could use the approaches that we and other central banks successfully\nemployed in the wake of the financial crisis to put additional downward pressure on long-\nterm interest rates and so support the economy--specifically, forward guidance about the\n9 Research suggests that, all else being equal, increased uncertainty and greater downside risk in the vicinity\nof the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates call for greater gradualism under optimal policy than\nwould be the case if short-term nominal interest rates were appreciably above zero. This phenomenon is\nknown as “policy attenuation” in the economic literature. For a discussion, see, for example, Adam and\nBilli (2007), Nakata (2012), Evans and others (2015), and Gust, Johannsen, and Lopez-Salido (2015).\n\n- 13 -\nfuture path of the federal funds rate and increases in the size or duration of our holdings\nof long-term securities.10 While these tools may entail some risks and costs that do not\napply to the federal funds rate, we used them effectively to strengthen the recovery from\nthe Great Recession, and we would do so again if needed.11\nOf course, economic conditions may evolve quite differently than anticipated in\nthe baseline outlook, both in the near term and over the longer run. If so, as I emphasized\nearlier, the FOMC will adjust monetary policy as warranted. As our March decision and\nthe latest revisions to the Summary of Economic Projections demonstrate, the Committee\nhas not embarked on a preset course of tightening. Rather, our actions are data\ndependent, and the FOMC will adjust policy as needed to achieve its dual objectives.\nFinancial market participants appear to recognize the FOMC’s data-dependent\napproach because incoming data surprises typically induce changes in market\nexpectations about the likely future path of policy, resulting in movements in bond yields\nthat act to buffer the economy from shocks. This mechanism serves as an important\n“automatic stabilizer” for the economy. As I have already noted, the decline in market\nexpectations since December for the future path of the federal funds rate and\naccompanying downward pressure on long-term interest rates have helped to offset the\ncontractionary effects of somewhat less favorable financial conditions and slower foreign\ngrowth. In addition, the public’s expectation that the Fed will respond to economic\n10 With regard to the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, the FOMC could increase its size by resuming large-\nscale purchases of longer-term Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities. Alternatively,\nthe FOMC could increase the duration of the Federal Reserve’s holdings without expanding the size of its\nportfolio by selling assets with relatively short residual maturities and buying equal amounts of assets with\nrelatively long residual maturities. Studies suggest that either action would reduce the term premiums\nembedded in longer-term interest rates considerably.\n11 For an overview of the macroeconomic effects of the Federal Reserve’s unconventional policies after the\nfinancial crisis, see Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015) and the references therein. For a discussion\nof the costs and benefits of these tools, see English, Lopez-Salido, and Tetlow (2015).\n\n- 14 -\ndisturbances in a predictable manner to reduce or offset their potential harmful effects\nmeans that the public is apt to react less adversely to such shocks--a response which\nserves to stabilize the expectations underpinning hiring and spending decisions.12\nSuch a stabilizing effect is one consequence of effective communication by the\nFOMC about its outlook for the economy and how, based on that outlook, policy is\nexpected to evolve to achieve our economic objectives. I continue to strongly believe\nthat monetary policy is most effective when the FOMC is forthcoming in addressing\neconomic and financial developments such as those I have discussed in these remarks,\nand when we speak clearly about how such developments may affect the outlook and the\nexpected path of policy. I have done my best to do so today, in the time you have kindly\ngranted me.\n12 That said, market expectations are not always well aligned with the Committee’s baseline outlook for the\nfederal funds rate. Market participants may hold different views about the economic outlook and the\nassociated risks and at times may be confused about the FOMC’s strategy. In such situations, the\nCommittee must do what it believes is appropriate while clearly explaining the rationale for its actions.\n\n- 15 -\nReferences\nAbrahams, Michael, Tobias Adrian, Richard K.

    "text": "Presentation to the Stanford Institute of Economic Policy Research\nStanford University, Palo Alto, California\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery February 11, 2005, 2:25 PM Pacific Time, 5:25 Eastern\nThe U.S. Economic Outlook\nIt’s a pleasure to join you today. I was very pleased when John Shoven asked me\nto share the dais with John Lipsky to give my views on the U.S. economic outlook and\nthe implications for monetary policy. Let me note that, as always, I am speaking for\nmyself and my comments do not necessarily reflect the opinions of other Fed\npolicymakers.\nI appreciate hearing John’s views on the real side of the economy. In general, I’m\nin agreement with him. Over the past year, output growth averaged three and three-\nquarters percent, modestly above trend, which, by most estimates, is around three and a\nquarter to three and a half percent. I believe that we have now seen enough positive signs\nin the economy to have some confidence that it is on course for sustained growth, being\nsupported by accommodative financial conditions and robust productivity growth.\nIn terms of the labor market, the data have been consistently positive for several\nquarters. Taking the average over all of 2004, the economy gained 181,000 jobs per\nmonth and in January it added another 146,000 jobs. This performance is by no means\nspectacular, but it is sufficient to conclude that the labor market is gradually firming up.\nIn January, the unemployment rate fell to 5.2 percent, suggesting that at least a bit of\nslack still remains.\nAs a Fed policymaker, of course, I’m committed to the dual goals of maximum\nemployment and price stability. Like my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\n1\n\nCommittee, my expectation is that inflation will remain well contained, assuming that the\neconomy continues to grow at a pace that is modestly above trend so that any remaining\nlabor market slack is gradually eliminated.\nThere are a number of risks to this outlook for inflation over the next year or so,\nbut overall, they appear to be essentially balanced. One risk is that there is a good deal of\nuncertainty about the actual extent of slack that remains in the labor market. Another\nrelates to the possibility of further movements of important relative prices—especially\nthe price of oil and the foreign exchange value of the dollar. A third risk is that firms’\nmarkups of prices over unit labor costs, which are now exceptionally high, could revert to\nmore normal levels. This could result in a significant reduction in the rate of inflation.\nProductivity Growth and Inflation\nThe final risk factor, and the one I’d like to focus on in my remarks today,\nconcerns the pace of labor productivity growth going forward. Productivity growth, of\ncourse, matters not just to inflation but also to the long-run prospects for the U.S.\neconomy. I might add that issues relating to productivity are of particular interest to the\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. As some of you know, a couple of years ago we\nestablished the Center for the Study of Innovation and Productivity at the Bank to explore\nthese very topics.\nSeveral recent developments have raised concerns about a productivity slowdown\nthat could slow economic growth and boost inflation. For example, during the latter half\nof 2004, the nation’s productivity growth came in noticeably below the astounding rate of\nnearly four and a half percent in the prior two and half years. In the third quarter, non-\nfarm productivity growth slowed to around one and three-quarters percent, and in the\n2\n\nfourth quarter to only eight-tenths of a percent. Moreover, during the last year, quality-\nadjusted computer prices haven’t been falling as fast as they have for the past decade.\nThat may signal some slowing of technological innovation in this sector. In addition,\nthere is some industry opinion that the pace of software development is beginning to\nslow.\nThese developments give us ample reason to think seriously about what the future\nmay hold for productivity growth. But it is also important to put them into perspective.\nFor one thing, productivity growth rates are extremely volatile over periods as short a few\nquarters, so we shouldn’t make too much of the very recent data. More importantly, I\nwant to emphasize that few economists expect the economy to continue to deliver the\nvery fast productivity growth rates we saw in both 2002 and 2003 and in the first half of\n2004. Rather, there’s some consensus among economists that the trend growth rate of\nU.S. productivity, since the productivity surge began in 1995, is around two and a half\npercent. That is still a very high number—nearly double what it had been during the\nquarter century before 1995—with the potential to enhance living standards dramatically\nin this country if it is maintained in the decades ahead. The real issue from the standpoint\nof inflation is whether recent developments portend a slowdown in the trend rate of\nproductivity growth below a rate of roughly two and a half percent.\nWhy would a slowdown below two and a half percent likely boost inflation? In\ntheory, there are two counteracting effects. First, a slowdown in the trend rate of\nproductivity growth is likely to raise business costs for a time, because firms would face\nmore rapid growth of unit labor costs. To offset the resulting squeeze on their profit\nmargins, they would need to raise prices more rapidly. Eventually, increases in unit\n3\n\nlabor costs are likely to fall back toward previous slower rates as workers are forced to\naccept lower wage growth to compensate for their slower productivity growth. But\nduring the adjustment period--which can last for a considerable period of time--there is\nupward pressure on inflation. Of course, by the same token, a rise in the trend growth\nrate of productivity could lead to downward pressure on inflation for a time.\nA slowdown in trend productivity growth would have a second effect which\nmight offset some of the upward pressure on inflation. A productivity slowdown would\nlikely result in slower growth in aggregate demand. Growth in consumer spending\nwould probably weaken as lower business profits limit stock market gains, thereby\nreducing household wealth. More foresighted consumers might also reduce spending,\nperceiving that the prospects for growth in real wages are not as bright. Further, lower\nexpected rates of productivity growth should restrain business investment by reducing the\nprospective return to capital.\nThe net impact of the two opposing effects of productivity growth on inflation is\nan empirical issue. My reading of the evidence suggests that the predominant medium-\nterm effect of a slowdown in productivity growth would likely be higher inflation.1 This\nwould seem to be the counterpart to the reductions in inflation that occurred over the past\ndecade, when rapid productivity growth aided the Fed in bringing inflation toward price\nstability.\nSo a key issue for inflation going forward is whether the trend growth rate of\nproductivity will remain near its estimated rate of around 2 ½ percent. If so, core\ninflation seems likely to remain stable, near its current moderate pace. If productivity\n1 For example, this conclusion is supported by simulations of the Federal Reserve Board staff’s model of\nthe U.S. economy called FRB/US.\n4\n\naccelerates or decelerates, we could see inflation start to fall or rise relative to the 1-1/2 to\n2 percent rate that prevails today. My own view is that the risks surrounding the outlook\nfor productivity are roughly balanced.\nProspects for productivity\nTo explain why I hold this view, let me start with a brief look at what the sources\nof productivity growth have been since the surge began in the mid-1990s. There are three\nbasic factors to consider. The first is capital investment—in particular, the pace at which\nthe quantity of capital per worker rises over time. The second is improved labor quality,\nor human capital—that is, a better educated or more skilled work force. The third factor\nis called “multifactor productivity,” which I will refer to as MFP for short. As you can\ntell by its eloquence, this is a term coined by economists. It essentially stands for all the\ngains in productivity that are not accounted for by either increased capital investment or\nimproved labor quality. It is thought to capture, more or less, the productivity gains that\nultimately stem from innovation. For example, it would include the engineering and\nscientific knowledge that goes into new technology. It also would include improved\nmanagement processes, such as ”just-in-time” inventory management, as well as\n“creative destruction,” whereby innovative firms expand market share at the expense of\nless innovative firms.\nEconomists at the Federal Reserve Board analyzed U.S. labor productivity,\nlooking at the period from 1996 to 2001, when productivity rose to nearly two and a half\npercent a year, as well as the period from 2002-2004, when labor productivity rose at an\nannual rate of almost four and a quarter percent.2 They found that the initial mid-1990s\n2 Figures cited update those in Oliner and Sichel (2002).\n5\n\nacceleration in labor productivity reflected in about equal parts an increased contribution\nof capital investment and an increase in MFP, with little, if any, change in the\ncontribution from worker skill improvements. But the results for the period from 2002 to\n2004 were noticeably different. This period, of course, was the worst of the “investment\nbust,” when business investment actually receded. The study’s results suggest that, over\nthose years, a further acceleration in MFP accounted for more than all of the acceleration\nin labor productivity.\nHow do we explain the most recent speedup in the pace of labor productivity and\nMFP growth? One possible answer is that the increase is more apparent than real, and\nthat it soon will be reversed. This argument relies on a link between shaky business\nconfidence and weak hiring. It’s understandable that the investment bust in the last\nrecession, the tragedy of 9/11, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the corporate\ngovernance scandals could have eroded business confidence. And that may have made\nfirms reluctant to take on the long-run commitment of adding workers. This hesitancy\ncould then lead to strong labor productivity growth to the extent that firms have been\npushing their existing workers particularly hard and requiring them to put in\nextraordinary effort. This extraordinary, unobserved effort would raise measured labor\nproductivity and MFP. Presumably, if this story were correct, then when firms regain\nconfidence, they’ll be willing to start hiring again, and the pace of productivity growth\nwill decline.\nFrankly, I have my doubts that an unusual degree of worker effort explains much\nof the strong productivity performance we’ve seen in the past few years. First, if firms\nwere boosting their productivity by making their existing employees work harder, you\n6\n\nwould also expect that they were requiring them to work longer hours.3 But the\nadmittedly limited data we have--which covers only production and non-supervisory\nworkers--don’t show that. Rather, they show that hours per worker have been declining\nsince the late 1990s.\nSecond, there have been considerable differences across states in labor market\nperformance since 2001, with some states expanding employment and others contracting.\nIf this story linked to unwillingness to hire were quantitatively important, then you might\nexpect to see less productivity growth in states where employment grew more rapidly\nthan in states where employment growth was weak. But an analysis of the data by staff at\nthe San Francisco Fed does not show that. Instead, for the most recent period, it finds\nessentially no relationship across states between employment (or output) growth and\nproductivity performance.4\nSo, what if we accept that much of the productivity speedup is real—and not\nmerely a mismeasurement of labor effort? What might explain the pickup in labor\nproductivity growth over the past few years? Some recent studies suggest that the answer\nlies in information technology, where the pace of technological innovation is clearly quite\nrapid. But its role in the last few years is different from its role in the late 1990s. In that\nperiod, studies tend to find that MFP gains in the production of information technology\ncontributed substantially to the overall pickup.5 In addition, firms invested heavily in\n3 Basu and Kimball (1997) provide a formal theoretical derivation of the link; they also provide theoretical\nsupport for using the workweek of labor to proxy for unobserved variations in the workweek of capital.\nBasu, Fernald, and Shapiro (2001) and Basu, Fernald, and Kimball (2004) provide recent econometric\nestimates of (otherwise unobserved) variations in factor utilization in U.S. data.\n4 Daly and Furlong (2005).\n5 See, e.g., Jorgenson and Stiroh (2000) and Oliner and Sichel (2000).\n7\n\nnew (and steadily cheaper) information technology, boosting capital investment in\nindustries that used IT intensively.\nBut for the more recent period, studies tend to find that the MFP acceleration is\nmore broad-based across industries that use technology—not confined to the IT-\nproducing sector. For example, the results I cited earlier from Federal Reserve Board\neconomists suggest that the MFP acceleration since 2002 is entirely accounted for (in\nfact, more than accounted for) by an acceleration in MFP in sectors that use information\ntechnology. Sectors that produce information technology, especially semiconductors,\nhave actually contributed somewhat less to MFP growth in the 2000s relative to the late\n1990s.6\nA mechanism that may explain the continued rise in MFP in sectors that use\ntechnology is that firms are learning new and better ways to use technology they already\nhave in place to become more productive. Indeed, some evidence suggests that the\nextraordinarily high rates of investment in high-tech equipment during the second half of\nthe 1990s actually led to a reduction in measured productivity growth over that period.\nThe reason is that firms had to devote a lot of human capital and time to learning how to\nget the most out of it; that is, resources were diverted from current production to\ninstalling the new capital and learning how to use it. If firms continue to increase their\nproficiency in using the technology they already have, this could help keep productivity\ngrowing at a robust pace. For example, one of our contacts told us that his law firm had\n6 That the U.S. productivity acceleration was broad-based is consistent with a growing body of recent\nwork. An early study that made this claim was Basu, Fernald, and Shapiro (2001). Other studies include\nCouncil of Economic Advisers (2003), which reports that between 1973−95 and 1995−2002, non-ICT MFP\naccelerated sharply, with its contribution to U.S. growth rising from 0.18 percentage points per year to 1.25\npercentage points. Bosworth and Triplett (2002) focus on the performance of service industries and find a\nwidespread acceleration. Jorgenson, Ho, and Stiroh (2004) also report that TFP accelerated outside ICT\nproduction.\n8\n\nrecently discovered they could use computer search facilities effectively to look for\nincriminating evidence in email files; that meant less labor on the project and therefore\nreduced legal expenses.\nSecond, a fundamental way that information technology enhances productivity is\nby allowing firms to reorganize work-place processes. For example, major banks report\nthat, through ongoing use of technology, they have been able to support growth in\ncustomers and services with fewer staff. A further example is the continuing expansion\nof Wal-Mart and other “big-box” stores, a trend that has had a dramatic effect on\nproductivity growth in the retail and wholesale sectors. This process of using information\ntechnology to reorganize work processes, of course, takes time. Sam Walton, for\nexample, argued that he benefited in the 1980s and 1990s from knowledge he had\naccumulated in the 1960s and 1970s, when he flew around the country visiting competing\ndiscount stores and attending IBM conferences.7\nMore formally, the growing academic literature on information technology as a\n“general purpose technology”--a technology that has broad applicability across the\neconomy--suggests that to reap its benefits, firms have to make substantial\ncomplementary investments in learning, reorganization, and the like. Hence, the payoff\nin terms of measured output may be long delayed.8 For example, one study finds that in a\nsample of 527 large U.S. firms from 1987 to 1994, the benefits of computers for output\n7 See Walton and Huey (1992).\n8 See, for example, Brynjolfsson and Hitt (2000) and Bresnahan (undated) for a discussion of the kinds of\ncomplementary investments and co-invention that firms undertake in order to benefit from ICT, given its\n“general purpose” attributes. David and Wright (2004) provide a nice historical reflection on general\npurpose technologies. See also Bresnahan and Trajtenberg (1995), and Helpman and Trajtenberg (1998).\n9\n\nand productivity rise over time and are not fully realized for at least five to seven years.9\nThe authors interpret their results as suggesting the importance of combining computer\ninvestments with “large and time-consuming investments in complementary inputs, such\nas organizational capital.” Another study finds that industries that had high growth rates\nof information and communications technology capital in the 1980s or early 1990s tended\nto have faster MFP growth rates in the late 1990s, consistent with the notion that firms\nwere undertaking unobserved investments in organizational capital, which then paid off\nin terms of measured output and productivity with a long lag.10 More generally,\ninnovations in information technology appear to have caused ripples of co-invention and\nco-investment in other sectors, such as retail trade.11\nIn addition, the general purpose technology literature suggests that the benefits of\ninformation technology used by one firm often “spill over” to other firms, which again\nimparts a lag to the process. For example, successful new managerial ideas—such as\nthose implemented in retail trade—seem likely to diffuse to other firms. Imitation is\noften easier and less costly than the initial co-invention of, say, a new organizational\nchange, because you learn by watching and analyzing the experimentation, the successes\nand, importantly, the mistakes of others.12\n9 Brynjolfsson and Hitt (2003).\n10 Basu, Fernald, Oulton, and Srinivasan (2003).\n11 Much of Brynjolfsson’s work tries to quantify the role of unobserved complementary capital.\nMacroeconomic studies of the effects of organizational capital include Greenwood and Yorukoglu (1997),\nHornstein and Krusell (1996), Hall (2001), and Laitner and Stolyarov (2003).\n12 Bresnahan (undated) provides a nice discussion of the channels for externalities to operate. Bresnahan\nand Trajtenberg (1995) highlight both “vertical” externalities (between general purpose technology\nproducers and each application sector) and “horizontal” externalities (across application sectors).\n10\n\nWhat does this analysis suggest that we should expect going forward? I’m\nreasonably optimistic. It seems unlikely that the business learning and reorganization\nthat we’ve been hearing about and that the academic literature emphasizes has suddenly\ndisappeared. My sense is that businesses are still learning what new technologies can do\nfor them.\nAs I noted earlier, several leading economists suggest that a reasonable estimate\nfor trend productivity growth going forward is about 2-1/2 percent per year.13 This is\nclose to the rate of productivity growth that we saw from 1995 to 2001. And although it\nwould represent a slowing of the outsized, and unsustainable, gains we’ve seen since\nthen, it appears fast enough to maintain the favorable inflation results we’ve had in recent\nyears. Forecasting is, of course, always uncertain and difficult. But it seems to me that\nthe risks to this expectation are reasonably well balanced.\nMonetary Policy\nI’ll conclude with just a few thoughts on monetary policy. We know that with the\nfederal funds rate at 2-1/2 percent---only about 1 percent or a bit less above the inflation\nrate---the current policy stance remains accommodative. Over time, the degree of\naccommodation will have to diminish, with policy reverting toward so-called “neutral”\nfor inflation to remain well contained. It’s uncertain exactly what the neutral range is,\nbut a common estimate is 3-5 percent. The Committee has stated for some time that, with\nunderlying inflation remaining low, policy accommodation can be removed at a pace\nwhich is likely to be measured. In fact, we have raised the rate by 25 basis points at each\nof the last six meetings. However, it should be obvious that the closer the actual rate gets\nto the neutral range, the more carefully we will need to consider each successive increase.\n13 See, for example, Baily (2003), Gordon (2003), and Jorgenson, Ho, and Stiroh (2004).\n11\n\nIn other words, the pace of removing policy accommodation must, in reality, depend on\nhow economic activity and inflation actually develop. Moreover, these developments\nthemselves could affect the Committee’s judgment concerning the momentum in\naggregate demand or supply and thus the real federal funds rate corresponding to a\nneutral policy stance.\nIf the pace of economic activity accelerates and labor market slack erodes more\nquickly than expected--or if some of the upside risks to inflation materialize—it would\nprobably be appropriate to remove accommodation more rapidly. If, alternatively, the\nexpansion falters or we experience some of the downside inflation risks, there are likely\nto be more opportunities for the Committee to pause. Of course, we could be confronted\nwith more difficult choices if output growth and inflation moved in opposite directions.\nIn any event, risks to both growth and inflation abound. However, I agree with the\nCommittee’s judgment, reiterated in its statement last week, that the upside and downside\nrisks are currently balanced.\n# # #\n12\n\nReferences\nBaily, Martin. 2003. \"Macroeconomic Implications of the New Economy.\" Institute for\nInternational Economics, Working Paper 01-09.\nBasu, Susanto, John G.

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Prospects for Growth: Reassessing the Fundamentals”\n59th Annual Meeting of the National Association for Business Economics\nCleveland, Ohio\nSeptember 26, 2017\n\nI would like to thank the National Association for Business Economics for\ninviting me to speak today and for the vital role the association plays in fostering debate\non important economic policy questions.\nToday I will discuss uncertainty and monetary policy, particularly as it relates to\nrecent inflation developments. Because changes in interest rates influence economic\nactivity and inflation with a substantial lag, the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) sets monetary policy with an eye to its effects on the outlook for the economy.\nBut the outlook is subject to considerable uncertainty from multiple sources, and dealing\nwith these uncertainties is an important feature of policymaking. Key among current\nuncertainties are the forces driving inflation, which has remained low in recent years\ndespite substantial improvement in labor market conditions. As I will discuss, this low\ninflation likely reflects factors whose influence should fade over time. But as I will also\ndiscuss, many uncertainties attend this assessment, and downward pressures on inflation\ncould prove to be unexpectedly persistent. My colleagues and I may have misjudged the\nstrength of the labor market, the degree to which longer-run inflation expectations are\nconsistent with our inflation objective, or even the fundamental forces driving inflation.\nIn interpreting incoming data, we will need to stay alert to these possibilities and, in light\nof incoming information, adjust our views about inflation, the overall economy, and the\nstance of monetary policy best suited to promoting maximum employment and price\nstability.\nRecent Inflation Developments and the Outlook\nLet me begin by reviewing recent inflation developments and the economic\noutlook. As the solid blue line in figure 1 indicates, inflation as measured by the price\n\n- 2 -\nindex for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) has generally run below the FOMC’s\n2 percent longer-run objective since that goal was announced in January 2012.1 Core\ninflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, has also fallen persistently\nshort of 2 percent (the red dashed line). Furthermore, both overall and core inflation,\nafter moving up appreciably last year, have slipped again in recent months. Sustained\nlow inflation such as this is undesirable because, among other things, it generally leads to\nlow settings of the federal funds rate in normal times, thereby providing less scope to\nease monetary policy to fight recessions. In addition, a persistent undershoot of our\nstated 2 percent goal could undermine the FOMC’s credibility, causing inflation\nexpectations to drift and actual inflation and economic activity to become more volatile.\nAs noted in its recent statement, the FOMC continues to anticipate that, with\ngradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, inflation will rise and stabilize at\naround 2 percent over the medium term. This expectation is illustrated by the green stars,\nwhich represent the medians of the inflation projections submitted by FOMC participants\nat our meeting last week. In part, this expectation reflects the significant improvement in\nlabor market conditions over the past few years. As shown in figure 2, the\nunemployment rate (the blue line) now stands at 4.4 percent, somewhat below the median\nof FOMC participants’ estimates of its longer-run sustainable level (the black line). As\nthe green stars indicate, labor market conditions are expected to strengthen a bit further.\nThe inflation outlook also reflects the Committee’s judgment that inflation expectations\nwill remain reasonably well anchored at a level consistent with PCE price inflation of\n2 percent in the long run, and that the restraint imposed in recent years by a variety of\n1 The Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy is available on the Board’s website at\nwww.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\nspecial factors, including movements in the relative prices of food, energy, and imports,\nwill wane in coming quarters.\nTo understand this assessment, it is useful to decompose the forces driving\nmovements in inflation since the financial crisis, as estimated using a simple model of\ninflation that I presented in a speech two years ago.2 Figure 3 reports this decomposition\nas the contributions made by various factors to the shortfall of PCE price inflation from\n2 percent, year by year. As illustrated by the purple dotted portion of the bars, labor\nunderutilization, or “slack,” accounts for a shrinking share of the shortfall since 2012 and\nis now having a negligible effect. By comparison, the influence of changes in relative\nfood, energy, and import prices--the solid blue and checkered red portions--has been\nmore substantial in the past few years, although their contribution is estimated to have\ngreatly diminished this year.3\nNot surprisingly, the simple model does not account for all of the year-to-year\nmovements in inflation. As indicated by the green striped portion of the bars, the residual\ncomponent of the shortfall was modestly positive on average from 2008 through last year.\nThis year, however, inflation has been unexpectedly weak from the model’s perspective.\nThis unusually large error does not necessarily imply that inflation is more likely to\n2 The simple model links the current rate of inflation to several factors, including lagged inflation, long-run\ninflation expectations, labor utilization, and changes in the relative prices of food, energy and imports\n(Yellen, 2015). Additional details on the model can be found in the appendix.\n3 In the decomposition procedure, movements in core inflation affect headline inflation one-for-one; as a\nresult, the contributions of food and energy price inflation are defined as each component’s price change\nrelative to the core, weighted by its share in total nominal consumer spending. The estimated contribution\nof movements in import prices is also computed relative to core inflation; thus, if import prices are rising at\nthe same rate as core inflation, they have no estimated effect on the shortfall of overall inflation from\n2 percent. In addition, the decomposition takes account of lags in the adjustment of core inflation to\nmovements in resource utilization and other factors. More details on the decomposition procedure can be\nfound in the appendix.\n\n- 4 -\ncontinue to come in on the low side in coming years.4 Some of the recent decline in\ninflation, although not all, reflects idiosyncratic shifts in the prices of some items, such as\nthe large decline in telecommunication service prices seen earlier in the year, that are\nunlikely to be repeated. As the green dashed line in figure 4 illustrates, if the average\nchange in consumer prices each month is calculated excluding items whose price changes\nare outliers on both the high and low side, the resulting “trimmed mean” measure of\ninflation shows less of a slowdown this year.5\nBased on analyses of this sort, my colleagues and I currently think that this year’s\nlow inflation is probably temporary, so we continue to anticipate that inflation is likely to\nstabilize around 2 percent over the next few years. But our understanding of the forces\ndriving inflation is imperfect, and we recognize that something more persistent may be\nresponsible for the current undershooting of our longer-run objective. Accordingly, we\nwill monitor incoming data closely and stand ready to modify our views based on what\nwe learn.\nUncertainty about the Inflation Outlook\nAlthough we judge that inflation will most likely stabilize around 2 percent over\nthe next few years, the odds that it could turn out to be noticeably different are\nconsiderable. This point is illustrated by figure 5. Here the red line indicates the median\n4 In the simple model, inflation depends in part on lagged inflation. As a result, an unexplained movement\nin inflation is predicted to influence inflation beyond the current quarter, but to a degree that fades over\ntime. On average, the model predicts that roughly 85 percent of any unexplained movement will have\ndisappeared after four quarters.\n5 In general, price changes measured over a few months tend to be noisy, even when measured on a core or\ntrimmed-mean basis. For this reason, the FOMC usually focuses on the growth rate of PCE prices over the\nprevious 12 months, which smooths through the volatility in the monthly price data. This approach also\nsidesteps distortions in the monthly data associated with residual seasonality; these distortions are likely to\nhold down month-to-month changes in prices over the balance of the year (see Peneva, 2014). That said,\n12-month rates of inflation will continue to be held down through early 2018 by the unusually weak\nmonthly readings on price changes recorded in early 2017.\n\n- 5 -\nof the latest inflation projections submitted by FOMC participants that I showed\npreviously. The pertinent feature of this figure is the blue shaded region around the red\nline, which shows a 70 percent confidence interval around FOMC participants’ median\noutlook. The width of this region reflects the average accuracy of inflation projections\nmade by private and government forecasters over the past 20 years. As the figure shows,\nbased on that history, there is a 30 percent probability that inflation could be greater than\n3 percent or less than 1 percent next year.6\nMost of this uncertainty reflects the influence of unexpected movements in oil\nprices and the foreign exchange value of the dollar, as well as that of idiosyncratic\ndevelopments unrelated to broader economic conditions. These factors could easily push\noverall inflation noticeably above or below 2 percent for a time. But such disturbances\nare not a great concern from a policy perspective because their effects fade away as long\nas inflation expectations remain anchored.7 For this reason, the FOMC strives to look\nthrough these transitory inflation effects when setting monetary policy. Such was the\ncase when rising oil prices pushed headline inflation noticeably above 2 percent for\nseveral years prior to the financial crisis. Similarly, the Committee substantially\ndiscounted the reductions in inflation that occurred from 2014 through 2016 as a result of\nthe decline in oil prices and the effects of the dollar’s appreciation on import prices.\nA more important issue from a policy standpoint is that some key assumptions\nunderlying the baseline outlook could be wrong in ways that imply that inflation will\nremain low for longer than currently projected. For example, labor market conditions\n6 See Reifschneider and Tulip (2017) for details on the calculation of these confidence intervals.\n7 This statement abstracts from any persistent effects such disturbances might have on real activity, which\ncould have implications for monetary policy.\n\n- 6 -\nmay not be as tight as they appear to be, and thus they may exert less upward pressure on\ninflation than anticipated. Alternatively, long-run inflation expectations, which have an\nimportant influence on actual inflation, may not be consistent with the FOMC’s 2 percent\ngoal. More broadly, the conventional framework for understanding inflation dynamics\ncould be misspecified in some fundamental way. Let’s now consider each of these\npossibilities in turn.\nResource Utilization\nThe unemployment rate consistent with long-run price stability at any time is not\nknown with certainty; we can only estimate it. The median of the longer-run\nunemployment rate projections submitted by FOMC participants last week is around\n4-1/2 percent. But the long-run sustainable unemployment rate can drift over time\nbecause of demographic changes and other factors, some of which can be difficult to\nquantify--or even identify--in real time.8 For these and other reasons, the statistical\nprecision of such estimates is limited, and the actual value of the sustainable rate could\nwell be noticeably lower than currently projected.9 Thus, although FOMC participants\ngenerally view current labor utilization as probably somewhat greater than what can be\nsustained in the longer run, the statistical evidence from past experience does not rule out\n8 For example, Aaronson and others (2015) estimate that increases in the average age and educational\nattainment of U.S. workers will reduce the sustainable rate of unemployment almost 1/2 percentage point\nbetween 2014 and 2020. Barnichon and Mesters (2017) also present evidence that demographic changes\nhave somewhat reduced the structural unemployment rate in the United States in recent years. Relatedly,\nYoon, Kim, and Lee (2014) and Juselius and Takats (2015) estimate that ongoing demographic transitions\nare having modest disinflationary effects in the United States and other developed economies.\n9 The statistical evidence also suggests that the sustainable rate of unemployment could be higher. As\nillustrated by the results reported in Reifschneider, Wascher, and Wilcox (2015) and Barnichon and\nMatthes (2017), standard errors for estimates of the sustainable rate of unemployment are typically at least\n1/2 percentage point. Accordingly, if the sustainable rate is estimated to be about 4-1/2 percent, there is\nroughly a 15 percent probability that the actual value is less than 4 percent; symmetrically, there is a\n15 percent probability that it is greater than 5 percent.\n\n- 7 -\nthe possibility that some slack still remains in the labor market. If so, the economy could\nsustain a higher level of employment and output in the longer run than now anticipated--a\nvery beneficial outcome, albeit one that would require recalibrating monetary policy over\ntime in order to reap those benefits and compensate for the accompanying reduction in\ninflationary pressures.\nA related question is whether the unemployment rate alone is an adequate gauge\nof economic slack for the purposes of explaining inflation. Although the unemployment\nrate is probably the best single summary measure of labor utilization, some indicators\nhave shown less improvement since the financial crisis.10 As the solid blue line in figure\n6 illustrates, the employed share of the “prime-age worker” population--that is, persons\nfrom ages 25 to 54--remains noticeably below the 2007 level.11 But employment rates\nfor this group may now be permanently lower than in the past as a result of declining\nemployment opportunities for less-skilled workers, a rising number of people receiving\ndisability insurance, and other worrisome trends.12 Similarly, although the share of part-\ntime workers who would like a full-time job is still somewhat above where it stood\n10 Several years ago, I discussed the interpretation of a wide range of labor market indicators at length\n(Yellen, 2014).\n11 The employment-to-population ratio for all persons aged 16 and over has recovered much less than the\nprime-age ratio since 2007, in large part reflecting the ongoing retirement of the baby boomers and a rise in\nschool attendance rates for young adults aged 20 to 24 (Aaronson and others, 2014). Schanzenbach and\nothers (2017) estimate that the substantial overall employment-to-population gap that opened up in the\nwake of the financial crisis finally closed in July 2017.\n12\nThe labor force participation rate for prime-age men has been declining for decades. Evidence suggests\nthat a portion of the decline is attributable to a reduction in the demand for low-skilled workers resulting\nfrom advances in technology and globalization. For a general discussion of the decline in male labor force\nparticipation, see Aaronson and others (2014). For a discussion of the role played by technical factors in\nthis decline, see Deming (forthcoming) and Acemoglu and Autor (2011); for a discussion of the role of\nglobalization, see Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2013) and Pierce and Schott (2016). In addition to these\nfactors, Autor and Duggan (2003) and French and Song (2014) present evidence suggesting that increases\nin the number of people on disability rolls have also been important. Relatedly, an alarming deterioration\nin health outcomes among low-education workers, including a rise in deaths related to alcohol, drugs, and\nsuicide, may be having an adverse effect on both male and female employment (Case and Deaton, 2017).\n\n- 8 -\nbefore the last two recessions (the dashed red line), it could reflect a structural change in\nfirms’ reliance on part-time labor.13 In addition, these two measures have to be weighed\nagainst other labor indicators that have either returned to, or are currently above, their\npre-recession levels. As shown in figure 7, those indicators include the quits rate (the\nshort-dashed blue line), household perceptions of job availability (the short-and-long-\ndashed green line), the jobs opening rate (the long-dashed red line), and the percentage of\nsmall firms finding it hard to fill jobs (the solid black line).\nOn balance, the unemployment rate probably is correct in signaling that overall\nlabor market conditions have returned to pre-crisis levels. But that return does not\nnecessarily demonstrate that the economy is now at maximum employment because, due\nto demographic and other structural changes, the unemployment rate that is sustainable\ntoday may be lower than the rate that was sustainable in the past.\nIn that regard, some observers have pointed to the continued subdued pace of\nwage growth as evidence that the economy is not yet back to full employment. As shown\nin figure 8, labor compensation as measured by the employment cost index (the short-\ndashed red line) has been growing at more or less the same rate since 2014, and hourly\ncompensation in the nonfarm business sector (the short-and-long-dashed green line)--a\nquite noisy measure, even after smoothing--is actually growing more slowly. But growth\nin average hourly earnings (the solid blue line) and the Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth\nTracker (the long-dashed black line) have clearly picked up.14 In addition, productivity\n13 For a discussion of how secular forces may be influencing the trend share of part-time employment, see\nValletta and van der List (2015).\n14 In contrast to the other wage and compensation measures, the Wage Growth Tracker only measures wage\nchanges for individuals who had a job in both the current month and a year ago.\n\n- 9 -\ngrowth has been quite weak in recent years, and empirical analysis suggests that it is has\nbeen holding down aggregate growth in labor compensation independent of labor\nutilization in recent years.15 An analysis of the pattern of wage growth at the U.S. state\nlevel also suggests that subdued growth for the country as a whole probably reflects\nsluggish productivity or some other factor common to all states, because cross-state\ndifferences in wage growth are about what one would expect given cross-state differences\nin unemployment rates.16 Finally, I would note that the percentage of firms planning\nwage increases has moved back up to its pre-recession level, many firms report\ndifficulties in finding qualified workers, and some have responded by expanding training\nprograms and offering signing bonuses--possible harbingers of stronger wage gains\nto come.\nOverall, I view the data we have in hand as suggesting a generally healthy labor\nmarket, not one in which substantial slack remains or one that is overheated. That said,\nthe evidence does not allow for any definitive assessment, so policymakers must remain\nopen minded on this question and its implications for reaching our inflation goal.\nInflation Expectations\nAnother source of uncertainty concerns inflation expectations. In standard\neconomic models, inflation expectations are an important determinant of actual inflation\nbecause, in deciding how much to adjust wages for individual jobs and prices of goods\n15 For example, predictions from a simple empirical model track recent movements in the employment cost\nindex reasonably well, because the model estimates that the increasing upward pressure on compensation\ngrowth from rising labor utilization is being offset by a declining contribution from productivity growth.\n(See the appendix for further details.) Relatedly, research also suggests that cyclical changes in the\ncomposition of the workforce associated with the absorption of new workers with relatively low skills and\nexperience may be currently restraining growth in both aggregate wages and productivity. See Daly and\nHobijn (2017) and Daly, Hobijn, and Pyle (2016), who also point to the retirement of baby boomers as a\nfactor holding down wage growth.\n16 See J.P. Morgan (2017) for more on this analysis.\n\n- 10 -\nand services at a particular time, firms take into account the rate of overall inflation they\nexpect to prevail in the future. Monetary policy presumably plays a key role in shaping\nthese expectations by influencing the average rate of inflation experienced in the past\nover long periods of time, as well as by providing guidance about the FOMC’s objectives\nfor inflation in the future. Even so, economists’ understanding of exactly how and why\ninflation expectations change over time is limited.17 Moreover, we have to contend with\nthe fact that we do not directly observe the inflation expectations relevant to wage and\nprice setting. Instead, we can only imperfectly infer how they might have changed based\non survey responses and other data.\nThe FOMC’s outlook depends importantly on the view that longer-run inflation\nexpectations have been stable for many years at a level consistent with PCE price\ninflation that will average around 2 percent in the longer run. Provided this stability\ncontinues, standard models suggest that actual inflation should stabilize at about\n2 percent over the next two or three years in an environment of roughly full employment,\nabsent any future shocks. However, there is a risk that inflation expectations may not be\nas well anchored as they appear and perhaps are not consistent with our 2 percent goal.\nTo assess this risk, the FOMC considers a variety of survey measures of expected longer-\nrun inflation, some of which are shown in figure 9. Long-range projections of PCE price\ninflation made by private forecasters, the solid red line, have been remarkably stable for\nmany years, as have been the longer-run inflation expectations reported in surveys of\n17 As I discussed in a speech one year ago, I view expectations formation as one of the key areas requiring\nfurther research by economists (see Yellen, 2016).\n\n- 11 -\nfinancial market participants (not shown).18 Households’ longer-term expectations as\nreported in the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, the short-dashed blue line,\nhave also been fairly stable overall since the late 1990s.19 That said, results from this\nsurvey, as well as a survey of consumers carried out by the Federal Reserve Bank of New\nYork, do hint that expectations may have slipped a bit over the past two or three years. If\nso, stabilizing inflation at around 2 percent could prove to be more difficult than\nexpected.20\nIn theory, differences between yields on conventional Treasury securities and\nthose on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are also informative about\ninflation expectations in that they measure the compensation received by investors for\nexposing themselves to future changes in consumer prices. As indicated by the long-\ndashed green line, TIPS inflation compensation for the five-year period starting five years\nfrom now has fallen roughly 1 percentage point over the past three years. This decline\n18 In the Survey of Primary Dealers conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the median of\nrespondents’ longer-term projections for PCE inflation have been essentially flat at 2 percent since the\nsurvey began in 2011. Similarly, in the Blue Chip Financial Indicators survey, which solicits the views of a\nlarge number of financial firms (as well as a few other institutions) about the extended outlook every June\nand December, the median of long-run expectations for GDP price inflation has stayed close to 2.1 percent\nover the past six years. Comparisons of results from these surveys to those reported in the Survey of\nProfessional Forecasters (as well as surveys of households) are somewhat complicated by differences in the\nprojection period used. For example, some surveys include the low rates of inflation expected over the next\nfew years in the calculation of projected longer-run averages, while other surveys exclude them.\n19 Expected inflation over the next 5 to 10 years as reported in the Michigan survey runs appreciably above\nPCE price inflation on average since the mid-1990s, perhaps because households are less informed about\nactual inflation developments than professional forecasters and financial firms. For this reason, it may be\nbest to focus on changes over time in the Michigan measure, not on the level.\n20 In addition to monitoring survey measures of expected inflation, Federal Reserve staff also use statistical\ntechniques to try to directly estimate possible movements over time in the underlying long-run trend in\ninflation, using data for actual inflation and other series, including resource utilization. Many of these\nstatistical estimates suggest that the underlying trend in PCE inflation is currently somewhat below\n2 percent. Econometrically, however, it is extremely difficult if not impossible to disentangle estimates of\nthe underlying trend in PCE inflation from estimates of the sustainable rate of unemployment. To be\nconsistent with the data, the higher one’s estimate of trend inflation or expected long-run inflation, the\nlower must be one’s estimate of the sustainable unemployment rate, at least over the medium run.\n\n- 12 -\ncould be interpreted as a significant drop in market participants’ expectations for the most\nlikely outcome for inflation in the longer run. However, research suggests that the fall in\nTIPS inflation compensation instead primarily reflects a decline in inflation risk\npremiums and differences in the liquidity of nominal and indexed Treasury securities.21\nThis research notwithstanding, the notable decline in inflation compensation may be a\nsign that longer-term inflation expectations have slipped recently.\nMisspecified Inflation Dynamics\nAnother risk is that our framework for understanding inflation dynamics could be\nmisspecified in some fundamental way, perhaps because our econometric models\noverlook some factor that will restrain inflation in coming years despite solid labor\nmarket conditions. One possibility in this vein is a continuation of the subdued growth in\nhealth-care prices that we have seen in recent years--a sector-specific factor not\ncontrolled for in standard models. Because health care accounts for a large share of total\nconsumer spending, this slow growth has restrained overall inflation materially and may\ncontinue to do so for some time.22 A similar situation occurred during the 1990s, when a\nsignificant shift in health insurance enrollment away from fee-for-service and toward\nHMO (that is, Health Maintenance Organization) plans reduced cost pressures and held\n21 For example, Andreasen and Christensen (2016) show that once TIPS liquidity premiums are taken into\naccount, the model-implied one-year inflation expectation becomes more stable and shows a smaller\ndecline since 2013. In addition, quotes on inflation derivatives suggest that most of the decline in inflation\ncompensation over this period is associated with investor perceptions of reduced risks of above-target\ninflation outcomes rather than increased risks of below-target inflation outcomes.\n22 Personal consumption expenditures include all medical services, including those paid by Medicare and\nMedicaid; prices for the latter may be viewed as “administered” because they are essentially set by the\ngovernment. The formulas used to set Medicare prices were adjusted by the 2010 Affordable Care Act and\nadditional legislation passed in 2015, resulting in smaller increases in prices for the same increase in costs\nthan would have been the case in the prior decade. In addition, Medicaid prices have probably been\nrestrained somewhat by budget pressures on state governments. Aside from these direct influences of\ngovernment policy on healthcare prices, some research suggests that lower Medicare prices tend to lead to\nlower negotiated prices by private insurers as well (see Clemens, Gottlieb, and Shapiro, 2016).\n\n- 13 -\ndown overall inflation for several years. If these sorts of favorable supply-type shocks\ncontinue, achieving our 2 percent inflation goal over the medium term may require a\nmore accommodative stance of monetary policy than might otherwise be appropriate.\nSome commentators have conjectured that, because of rising trade volumes and\nthe integration of production chains across countries, U.S. inflation now depends on\nglobal resource utilization, not just on conditions here at home and those effects arising\nthrough movements in energy and import prices. However, studies of this issue do not,\non balance, provide much empirical support for this possibility.23 Moreover, foreign\neconomic growth has firmed this year and the global economy appears to have largely\nrecovered, so any influence that global resource utilization might have on U.S. inflation\nwould presumably be small. Nevertheless, increased competition from the integration of\nChina and other emerging market countries into the world economy may have materially\nrestrained price margins and labor compensation in the United States and other advanced\neconomies. In fact, one study concludes that most of the decline in the labor share of\nnational income in the United States since the late 1980s can be attributed to offshoring\nof labor-intensive production.24 If this restraint on the labor share continues to build over\n23 In an early study, Borio and Filardo (2007) reported results suggesting that global economic slack adds\nconsiderable explanatory power to reduced-form inflation equations (such as the one discussed in the\nappendix), and that its role has been growing over time. However, Ihrig, Kamin, Lindner, and Marquez\n(2010) subsequently argued that the estimated link was not robust to alternative measures of global\nresource utilization. Federal Reserve Board staff have updated this analysis using data through early 2017\nand confirmed that global slack does not appear to exert an appreciable direct effect on domestic inflation\nin the United States and most other advanced economies.\n24 Using sector-level data, Elsby, Hobijn, and Sahin (2013) estimate the contributions of offshoring, the\nsubstitution of capital for low-skilled labor, and several other factors on the aggregate U.S. labor share of\nincome, and find that only offshoring has been important. They also conclude that the decline in the labor\nshare since the late 1980s has been overstated as a result of statistical measurement problems. In contrast\nto the influence of globalization on the U.S. labor share, Feenstra and Weinstein (2017) find that the\ninfluence of increased globalization on price markups in the United States has been modest.\n\n- 14 -\nthe next few years (and not merely holds steady), then it could indirectly hold down the\ngrowth of domestic wages and prices in ways not captured by conventional models.\nMore speculatively, changes in the structure of the domestic economy may also\nbe altering inflation dynamics in ways not captured by conventional models. The\ngrowing importance of online shopping, by increasing the competitiveness of the U.S.\nretail sector, may have reduced price margins and restrained the ability of firms to raise\nprices in response to rising demand.25 That said, the economy overall appears to have\nbecome more concentrated and less dynamic in recent years, which may tend to increase\nfirms’ pricing power.26 Because these changes occur slowly, determining their complex\neffects on the economy will, as a practical matter, require studying data over a\nconsiderable time.\nFinally, I would note the possibility that inflation may rise more sharply in\nresponse to robust labor market conditions than anticipated. The influence of labor\nutilization on inflation has become quite modest over the past 20 years, implying that the\ninflationary consequences of misjudging the sustainable rate of unemployment are low.\nBut we cannot be sure that this modest sensitivity will persist in the face of strong labor\nmarket conditions, given that we do not fully understand how it came to be so modest in\nthe first place. Although the evidence is weak that inflation responds in a nonlinear\nmanner to resource utilization, this risk is one that we cannot entirely dismiss.\n25 For more on the inflation implications of innovation in the retail sector, see Curran and Jamrisko (2017)\nand Trainer (2016).\n26 For a review of changes over time in the competitive structure of the overall economy, see Council of\nEconomic Advisers (2016). For a discussion of the evidence for, and some of the implications of, changes\nin the dynamism of the economy, see Hathaway and Litan (2014) and Decker and others (2016).\n\n- 15 -\nPolicy Implications\nWhat are the policy implications of these uncertainties? For one, my colleagues\nand I must be ready to adjust our assessments of economic conditions and the outlook\nwhen new data warrant it. In this spirit, FOMC participants--like private forecasters--\nhave reduced their estimates of the sustainable unemployment rate appreciably over the\npast few years in response to the continual flow of information about the always changing\neconomy.27 To the extent these assessments change over time, so too will the outlook\nand judgments about the appropriate stance of monetary policy. Importantly, even if\nresource utilization is currently lower than we estimate or if longer-run inflation\nexpectations are running at levels consistent with longer-run PCE price inflation\nsomewhat below 2 percent, the FOMC can still achieve its inflation goal. Under those\nconditions, continuing to revise our assessments in response to incoming data would\nnaturally result in a policy path that is somewhat easier than that now anticipated--an\nappropriate course correction that would reflect our commitment to maximum\nemployment and price stability.\nSimilar considerations apply to other important sources of uncertainty, such as the\nvalue of the neutral real interest rate--that is, the inflation-adjusted level of the federal\nfunds rate consistent with keeping the economy operating on an even keel. Estimates of\nthis rate have declined considerably in recent years, and, by some estimates, the real\nneutral rate is currently close to zero. But the neutral rate changes over time as a result of\nthe interaction of many forces, including demographics, productivity growth, fiscal\n27 The median of FOMC participants’ projections of the longer-run unemployment rate has declined almost\na full percentage point over the past five years; the revision in the long-run consensus forecast reported in\nthe Blue Chip Survey between October 2012 and March 2017 was slightly larger.\n\n- 16 -\npolicy, and the strength of global demand, so its value at any point in time cannot be\nestimated or projected with much precision. My FOMC colleagues and I will therefore\nneed to continue to reassess and revise our assessments of the neutral rate in response to\nincoming data and adjust monetary policy accordingly.\nHow should policy be formulated in the face of such significant uncertainties? In\nmy view, it strengthens the case for a gradual pace of adjustments. Moving too quickly\nrisks overadjusting policy to head off projected developments that may not come to pass.\nA gradual approach is particularly appropriate in light of subdued inflation and a low\nneutral real interest rate, which imply that the FOMC will have only limited scope to cut\nthe federal funds rate should the economy be hit with an adverse shock.28 But we should\nalso be wary of moving too gradually. Job gains continue to run well ahead of the\nlonger-run pace we estimate would be sufficient, on average, to provide jobs for new\nentrants to the labor force. Thus, without further modest increases in the federal funds\nrate over time, there is a risk that the labor market could eventually become overheated,\npotentially creating an inflationary problem down the road that might be difficult to\novercome without triggering a recession. Persistently easy monetary policy might also\neventually lead to increased leverage and other developments, with adverse implications\nfor financial stability. For these reasons, and given that monetary policy affects\neconomic activity and inflation with a substantial lag, it would be imprudent to keep\nmonetary policy on hold until inflation is back to 2 percent.\n28 It might be thought that the FOMC could mitigate this problem by raising the federal funds rate higher\nthan might otherwise be called for while the economy continues to expand in order to increase the extent to\nwhich interest rates could be cut later should a recession occur. But this strategy would be\ncounterproductive, because it would only serve to weaken economic activity and push down inflation\nbefore the recession.\n\n- 17 -\nConclusion\nTo conclude, standard empirical analyses support the FOMC’s outlook that, with\ngradual adjustments in monetary policy, inflation will stabilize at around the FOMC’s\n2 percent objective over the next few years, accompanied by some further strengthening\nin labor market conditions. But the outlook is uncertain, reflecting, among other things,\nthe inherent imprecision in our estimates of labor utilization, inflation expectations, and\nother factors. As a result, we will need to carefully monitor the incoming data and, as\nwarranted, adjust our assessments of the outlook and the appropriate stance of monetary\npolicy. But in making these adjustments, our longer-run objectives will remain\nunchanged--to promote maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.\n\n- 18 -\nAppendix: PCE Inflation Model, Inflation Decomposition Procedure, and the ECI\nGrowth Equation\nPCE Inflation Model\nThe inflation model used in the decomposition procedure includes two equations:\nan identity for the change in the price index for total personal consumption expenditures\n(PCE) and a simple reduced-form forecasting equation for core PCE price inflation.

Extending\nthe estimation period through 2017:Q2 has little effect on the estimated coefficients and the decomposition\nestimates.\n\n- 19 -\nrun PCE price inflation reported in the Survey of Professional Forecasters; from 1991:Q4\nto 2006:Q4, the series is based on the median long-run forecasts of inflation as measured\nby the consumer price index (CPI), less a constant adjustment of 40 basis points to put\nthe CPI forecasts on a PCE basis; before 1991:Q4, (cid:2024)(cid:3032) is approximated by the long-run\n(cid:3047)\ninflation expectations reported in the Hoey survey. The relative import price term,\n(cid:1844)(cid:1842)(cid:1835)(cid:1839) , is defined as the annualized growth rate of the price index for core imported\n(cid:3047)\ngoods (defined to exclude petroleum, natural gas, computers, and semiconductors) less\nthe lagged four-quarter change in core PCE inflation, all multiplied by the share of\nnominal core imported goods in nominal GDP.30\nInflation Decomposition Procedure\nTo decompose recent movements in inflation into its various components, the\nseries used in the inflation model--for which complete quarterly data are available only\nthrough 2017:Q2 in most cases--are first extended through the end of 2017. In the case\nof inflation, the extensions are consistent with the medians of Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) participants’ projections for total and core PCE inflation in 2017 that\nwere reported at the press conference following the September 2017 FOMC meeting.31\nSimilarly, (cid:1845)(cid:1838)(cid:1827)(cid:1829)(cid:1837) over the second half of 2017 is defined to be consistent with the\n(cid:3047)\nmedian of FOMC projections for the 2017:Q4 unemployment rate less the CBO’s\nestimates of the historical path of the long-run natural rate. The CBO’s 2017 estimate is\nslightly higher than the median of FOMC participants’ most recent projections of the\n30 This measure of core import prices is constructed by Board staff using published and unpublished data\nprovided by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n31 The information on participants’ forecasts provided at the September 20, 2017, press conference is\navailable on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20170920.pdf.\n\n- 20 -\nnormal longer-run level of the unemployment rate. For changes in the price of core\nimports, the 2017:H2 extrapolations are based on a regression of this series on current\nand lagged changes in exchange rates. This approach predicts that core import prices\nshould rise about 4-1/2 percent at an annual rate in the second half of this year.32 Energy\nand food prices over the second half of 2017 are assumed to rise at annual rates of\n10 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively; these assumptions (which take into account\npublished monthly PCE data through July and published CPI data through August, as\nwell as recent movements in gasoline prices in the wake of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma)\nensure that the combined contribution of food and energy prices to inflation in 2017 is\nconsistent with the median difference between FOMC participants’ projections for total\nand core inflation. Finally, nominal spending shares for food, energy, and core imports\nare assumed to remain unchanged at their 2017:Q2 levels, and long-run inflation\nexpectations are assumed to remain constant at 2 percent.\nAfter computing historical tracking errors for the two equations of the model,\nthe final step in the decomposition 𝜖𝜖p 𝑡𝑡 rocedure is to run a sequence of counterfactual\nsimulations of the model from 1990:Q1 through 2017:Q4. One by one, each explanatory\nvariable of the model is set to zero, and the model is simulated; the resulting difference\nbetween actual inflation and its simulated value equals the historical contribution of that\n32 The level of core import prices, expressed relative to core consumer prices, displayed a modest\ndownward trend from 1990 through 2001 but since then has displayed little persistent trend, particularly if\none controls for shifts related to recent changes in the real exchange rate. If the post-2001 pattern persists\nin coming years, then would be expected to converge to zero within a few quarters and core PCE\ninflation to converge to 2 percent within two or three years, assuming that the unemployment rate remains\nnear 4-1/2 percent (the𝑅𝑅 m𝑅𝑅e𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅di 𝑡𝑡 an of the longer-run projections provided by FOMC participants) and there are\nno further shocks to the exchange rate and other factors. If, however, core import prices were expected to\nresume trending down relative to consumer prices, then the model as specified would imply that the\nunemployment rate consistent with inflation stabilizing at 2 percent in the longer run would be somewhat\nlower than 4-1/2 percent.\n\n- 21 -\nparticular factor. Importantly, the simulations are all dynamic in that the lagged inflation\nterm in the core inflation equation is set equal to its simulated value in the preceding\nperiod rather than its actual value. As a result, the decompositions incorporate the effects\nof changes in lagged inflation that are attributable to previous movements in the\nexplanatory variables.\nECI Growth Equation\nThe estimated equation for the employment cost index (ECI) is:\n𝑤𝑤 𝑒𝑒 𝑤𝑤 𝑤𝑤 𝑤𝑤 𝑤𝑤\n𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 = −0.72+.58𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−1 +.10𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−1 +.12𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−2 +.10𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−3 +.,1 1𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−4 −.19𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 −\nwhere is the annualized.5 l7o∆g 𝑆𝑆d𝑆𝑆if𝑆𝑆fe𝑆𝑆r𝑆𝑆en 𝑡𝑡 c+e .o5f8 t𝑅𝑅he𝑆𝑆 E_𝑅𝑅C𝑅𝑅I 𝑃𝑃fo𝑃𝑃r 𝑡𝑡 h+ou𝜀𝜀rl 𝑡𝑡 y compensation of private\n𝑤𝑤\nindustr𝜋𝜋y 𝑡𝑡 workers, and have the same definition as the corresponding variables\n𝑒𝑒\nfrom the PCE pric𝜋𝜋e 𝑡𝑡 inflati𝑆𝑆o𝑆𝑆n𝑆𝑆 m𝑆𝑆o𝑆𝑆d 𝑡𝑡 e l, denotes the first difference of ,\nis a moving average of a∆n𝑆𝑆 e𝑆𝑆s𝑆𝑆ti𝑆𝑆m𝑆𝑆a 𝑡𝑡 te of trend productivity growth 𝑆𝑆fo𝑆𝑆r𝑆𝑆 t𝑆𝑆he𝑆𝑆 𝑡𝑡\nb𝑅𝑅u𝑆𝑆si_n𝑅𝑅e𝑅𝑅ss𝑃𝑃 s𝑃𝑃e 𝑡𝑡 c tor, and is an error term.33 The coefficients are obtained from a restricted\nleast squares regressi𝜀𝜀o 𝑡𝑡 n using quarterly data from 1988:Q1 to 2017:Q2.34 Trend\nproductivity growth is estimated as the low-frequency component of the annualized log\ndifference of business-sector output per hour from the Bureau of Labor Statistics\nProductivity and Costs report.35 The moving average of trend productivity growth\n33 The ECI series used here is obtained from a ratio splice of the SIC- and NAICS-based indexes; the SIC-\nbased index is used before 2001 and the NAICS-based index used thereafter.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n5:00 p.m. EDT\nApril 4, 2013\nCommunication in Monetary Policy\nRemarks by\nJanet L. Yellen\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nSociety of American Business Editors and Writers\n50th Anniversary Conference\nWashington, D.C.\nApril 4, 2013\n\nThank you for inviting me here and for offering me what I consider a perfect\nopportunity to speak on a topic at the heart of the Federal Reserve’s efforts to promote a\nstronger economy--the vital role and growing use of communication in monetary policy.1\nSome of you cover the Federal Reserve and are familiar with how it sets monetary\npolicy through the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). You know that the FOMC\npays very close attention to what it says in the statements it issues after each meeting.\nThis communication is supplemented by Chairman Bernanke’s postmeeting press\nconferences and by providing detailed minutes of the Committee’s meetings. Getting this\nmessage out to the public depends a good deal on the work you do in reporting on the\nFOMC, analyzing its statements and actions, and explaining its role and objectives. So\nlet me begin by thanking you for those contributions.\nBut let me also say why I am particularly pleased to speak to you today. As\nwriters and editors, all of you are prodigious consumers and producers of communication.\nAt first glance, the FOMC’s communication may not seem so different from what you’ve\nheard other government agencies say about their policies or businesses say about their\nproducts. I hope to show how communication plays a distinct and special role in\nmonetary policymaking.\nLet me offer a comparison that may highlight that difference. Suppose, instead of\nmonetary policy, we were talking about an example of transportation policy--widening a\nroad to ease traffic congestion. Whether this road project is announced at a televised\npress conference or in a low-key press release--or even if there is no announcement--the\nproject is more or less the same. The benefit to drivers will come after the road is\n1 I am indebted to members of the Board staff--Jon Faust, Thomas Laubach, and John Maggs--who\ncontributed to the preparation of these remarks.\n\n- 2 -\nwidened and won’t be affected by whether drivers knew about the project years in\nadvance.\nAt the heart of everything I’ll be explaining today is the fact that monetary policy\nis different. The effects of monetary policy depend critically on the public getting the\nmessage about what policy will do months or years in the future.2\nTo develop this idea, I will take you on a tour of past FOMC communication, the\npresent, and what I foresee for the future. Until fairly recently, most central banks\nactively avoided communicating about monetary policy. Montagu Norman, governor of\nthe Bank of England in the early 20th century, reputedly lived by the motto “never\nexplain, never excuse,” and that approach was still firmly in place at the Federal Reserve\nwhen I went to work there as a staff economist in 1977.\nI’ll begin by discussing how a growing understanding of the importance of\ntransparency shaped FOMC communication in the years before the financial crisis. Next,\nI’ll relate how the financial crisis brought unprecedented challenges for monetary policy\nthat required the use of unconventional policy tools, including some barely contemplated\nbefore the crisis. Communication was a centerpiece of these efforts. Finally, I’ll look\nahead. I am encouraged by recent signs that the economy is improving and healing from\nthe trauma of the crisis, and I expect that, at some point, the FOMC will return to a more\nnormal approach to monetary policy. At the conclusion of my remarks, I’ll discuss the\ncommunication challenges the FOMC will face when it comes time to make that\ntransition.\n2 Like almost every government policy action, this hypothetical road project could affect expectations--it\nmight influence decisions about where people live or commercial development, for example. The crucial\ndifference is that these are not the primary and stated aim of this policy action, which is to reduce traffic\ncongestion. As these remarks go on to explain, unlike most government policy actions, monetary policy is\nprimarily concerned with affecting expectations of the future.\n\n- 3 -\nFOMC communication has long been a topic of great interest to me, and one I\nhave worked on more directly since 2010, when Chairman Bernanke asked me to lead a\nnew FOMC subcommittee on communications. This is probably a good moment to\nremind you that, as always, I speak for myself and not the FOMC or my colleagues in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nFrom “Never Explain” to Transparency\nRecently I used the word “revolution” to describe the change from “never\nexplain” to the current embrace of transparency in the FOMC’s communication.3 That\nmight sound surprising to an audience that knows very well what it feels like to be in the\nmiddle of a communications revolution. The speed and frequency of most\ncommunication, it seems, never stops growing, and I will admit that the FOMC’s changes\nto the pace and form of its communication seem rather modest in comparison. I’ve\nmentioned the Chairman’s quarterly postmeeting press conferences, which were initiated\ntwo years ago. While these events are televised and streamed live, the mode for most of\nthe FOMC’s communication is decidedly old-school--the printed word. The\nCommittee’s most watched piece of communication is the written statement issued after\neach of its meetings, which are held roughly every six weeks. It may seem quaint that\nmy colleagues and I continue to spend many hours laboring over the few hundred words\nin this statement, which are then extensively analyzed only minutes after their release.\nThe revolution in the FOMC’s communication, however, isn’t about technology\nor speed. It’s a revolution in our understanding of how communication can influence the\neffectiveness of monetary policy.\n3 See Janet L. Yellen (2012), “Revolution and Evolution in Central Bank Communications,” speech\ndelivered at the Haas School of Business, University of California, Berkeley, November 13,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20121113a.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nIt will help if I start with some basics. The FOMC consists of the 7 members of\nthe Federal Reserve Board in Washington and 5 of the 12 presidents of the regional\nFederal Reserve Banks. All 12 presidents participate in FOMC meetings but only 5 get a\nvote, a roster that rotates each year.\nThe FOMC’s job, assigned by the Congress, is to use monetary policy to promote\nmaximum employment and stable prices, objectives that together are known as the\nFederal Reserve’s dual mandate. In normal times, the Committee pursues these goals by\ninfluencing the level of a short-term interest rate called the federal funds rate, which is\nwhat banks charge each other for overnight loans. When the FOMC pushes the federal\nfunds rate up or down, other short-term interest rates normally move in tandem.\nMedium- and longer-term interest rates, including auto loan rates and mortgage rates,\ngenerally adjust also, through a mechanism I will return to in a moment. By pushing the\nfederal funds rate up or down, the FOMC seeks to influence a wide range of interest rates\nthat matter to households and businesses.\nTypically, the FOMC acts to lower the federal funds rate, with the intention of\nreducing interest rates generally, when the economy is weakening or inflation is declining\nbelow the Committee’s longer-run objective. The FOMC raises the federal funds rate\nwhen inflation threatens to rise above its objective or when economic activity appears\nlikely to rise above sustainable levels. Raising and lowering the federal funds rate was\nlong the primary means by which the FOMC pursued its economic objectives.\nIt is hard to imagine now, but only two decades ago, the Federal Reserve and\nother central banks provided the public with very little information about such monetary\npolicy moves--the spirit of “never explain” was very much alive. There were a number\n\n- 5 -\nof different justifications for this approach. One view was that less disclosure would\nreduce the risk and tamp down suspicions that some could take advantage of disclosures\nmore readily than others. Some believed that markets would overreact to details about\nmonetary policy decisions. And there was a widespread belief that communicating about\nhow the FOMC might act in the future could limit the Committee’s discretion to change\npolicy in response to future developments. In sum, the conventional wisdom among\ncentral bankers was that transparency was of little benefit for monetary policy and, in\nsome cases, could cause problems that would make policy less effective.\nWhile communication and transparency steadily increased elsewhere in\ngovernment and society, change came slowly to the FOMC. It wasn’t until February\n1994 that the Committee issued a postmeeting statement disclosing a change in monetary\npolicy. Even then, it only alerted the public that the Committee had changed its policy\nstance, with scant explanation.4\nSomething big was changing, however, and it would soon be the force driving\nmajor enhancements in the FOMC’s communication. By the early 1990s, a growing\nbody of research challenged widespread assumptions about the how central banks, such\nas the Federal Reserve, affected the economy. The reevaluation starts with a question\nthat puzzled many of my students when I was a professor: How is it that the Federal\nReserve manages to move a vast economy just by raising or lowering the interest rate on\novernight loans by 1/4 of a percentage point?\nThe question arises because significant spending decisions--expanding a business,\nbuying a house, or choosing how much to spend on consumer goods over the year--\n4 Previously, the public inferred policy changes by observing the Federal Reserve’s behavior in securities\nmarkets.\n\n- 6 -\ndepend on expectations of income, employment, and other economic conditions over the\nlonger term, as well as longer-term interest rates. The crucial insight of that research was\nthat what happens to the federal funds rate today or over the six weeks until the next\nFOMC meeting is relatively unimportant. What is important is the public’s expectation\nof how the FOMC will use the federal funds rate to influence economic conditions over\nthe next few years.5\nFor this reason, the Federal Reserve’s ability to influence economic conditions\ntoday depends critically on its ability to shape expectations of the future, specifically by\nhelping the public understand how it intends to conduct policy over time, and what the\nlikely implications of those actions will be for economic conditions. To return to the\nexample I used earlier, contrast this effect on expectations with that of a road project.\nToday’s commute, alas, will not be improved or changed at all by the news that a road\nwill be widened one day. But the effects of today’s monetary policy actions are largely\ndue to the effect they have on expectations about how policy will be set over the medium\nterm.\nLet me further illustrate this with some history. Starting in the mid-1960s, the\nFederal Reserve didn’t act forcefully in the face of rising inflation, and the public grew\nless certain of the central bank’s commitment to fighting inflation. This uncertainty led\nexpectations of future inflation to become “unanchored” and more likely to react to\neconomic developments. In 1973, an oil price shock led to a large increase in overall\ninflation. Expectations of higher inflation in the future affected the public’s behavior--\nworkers demanded raises, and businesses set prices and otherwise acted in anticipation of\n5 Another factor that adds to the importance of expectations is that changes in monetary policy affect real\nactivity and inflation with a substantial time lag.\n\n- 7 -\nhigher costs--and this helped fuel actual inflation. The FOMC’s occasional efforts to\nreduce inflation in the 1970s were ineffective partly due to the expectation that it\nultimately wouldn’t do enough.\nBy contrast, most of you probably know about the Federal Reserve’s successful\ninflation fighting in the early 1980s. The FOMC raised the federal funds rate very high,\ncausing a deep recession but also convincing the public that it was committed to low and\nstable inflation. Anchoring inflation expectations at low levels helped ensure that jumps\nin commodity prices or other supply shocks would not generate persistent inflation\nproblems. This was illustrated by the effect of another escalation in oil prices starting in\n2005. Unlike in the 1970s, these price shocks did not result in a broad and lasting\nincrease in overall inflation because the public believed the Federal Reserve would keep\ninflation in check. The FOMC wasn’t forced to raise interest rates--which softened the\nblow of higher fuel costs on households and businesses--because of the credibility the\nFederal Reserve had built since the 1980s.\nIf the public’s expectations have always been important, you might wonder how\nmonetary policy had any effect prior to the transparency revolution. As it turns out, with\nthe notable exception of the late 1960s and 1970s, the FOMC usually responded in a\nsystematic way to economic conditions. In 1993, economist John Taylor documented\nthat FOMC policy changes since the mid-1980s had fairly reliably followed a simple rule\nbased on inflation and output. Changes in the federal funds rate were usually made in\nseveral small steps over a number of months. In practice, the Federal Reserve’s approach\nwas “never explain, but behave predictably.”\n\n- 8 -\nA close analysis of the FOMC’s past behavior was a good guide to future policy,\nbut it had two shortcomings as a substitute for transparency: First, it gave an advantage\nto sophisticated players who studied the FOMC’s behavior--something that is arguably\ninappropriate for a government institution. Second, while a policy rule such as the one\ndeveloped by John Taylor explained the course of the federal funds rate much of the time,\nthere were cases when it didn’t and when even the experts failed to correctly anticipate\nthe FOMC’s actions.\nThe trend toward greater transparency accelerated during the early 2000s.\nStarting in 2000, the FOMC issued information after every meeting about its economic\noutlook. It also provided an assessment of the balance of risks to the economy and\nwhether it was leaning toward increasing or decreasing the federal funds rate in the\nfuture. Such information about intentions and expectations for the future, known as\nforward guidance, became crucial in 2003, when the Committee was faced with a\nstubbornly weak recovery from the 2001 recession. It had cut the federal funds rate to\nthe very low level of 1 percent, but unemployment remained elevated, and the FOMC\nsought some further way to stimulate the economy. In this situation, it told the public\nthat it intended to keep the federal funds rate low for longer than might have been\nexpected by adding to its statement that “[i]n these circumstances, the Committee\nbelieves that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period.”6\nLet’s pause here and note what this moment represented. For the first time, the\nCommittee was using communication--mere words--as its primary monetary policy tool.\nUntil then, it was probably common to think of communication about future policy as\n6 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2003), “FOMC Statement,” press release,\nAugust 12, www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/press/monetary/2003/20030812/default.htm.\n\n- 9 -\nsomething that supplemented the setting of the federal funds rate. In this case,\ncommunication was an independent and effective tool for influencing the economy. The\nFOMC had journeyed from “never explain” to a point where sometimes the explanation\nis the policy.\nBy the eve of the recent financial crisis, it was established that the FOMC could\nnot simply rely on its record of systematic behavior as a substitute for communication--\nespecially under unusual circumstances, for which history had little to teach. I think\nwe’re all fortunate that policymakers had learned this lesson, because the FOMC was\nabout to encounter unprecedented economic conditions and policy challenges. The\nfinancial crisis and its aftermath demanded advances in FOMC communication as great\nas any that had come before.\nMonetary Policy since the Onset of the Financial Crisis\nThe situation in 2008 and 2009 was like nothing the Federal Reserve had faced\nsince the 1930s. In late 2008, the FOMC cut the federal funds rate nearly to zero--\nessentially, as low as it could go--where it has remained. With its traditional tool for\nexpansionary monetary policy--lowering the federal funds rate--off the table, the FOMC\nturned to unconventional and, in some cases, newly invented policy options to try both to\nhelp stabilize the financial system and to arrest the plunge in economic activity. The\npublic had grown accustomed to monetary policy that focused on changes to the federal\nfunds rate target, with occasional, and at this point fairly limited, guidance that a\nparticular policy stance would probably last for a while. Beyond the task of describing\nthe new policies, extensive new communication was needed to justify these\n\n- 10 -\nunconventional policy actions and convincingly connect them to the Federal Reserve’s\nemployment and inflation objectives.\nThe best known of these unconventional policies is large-scale asset purchases,\ncommonly known as quantitative easing. Starting in late 2008 and continuing through\ntoday, the Federal Reserve has purchased longer-term government agency debt securities,\nagency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities, and longer-term Treasury securities that\nhave added about $2.5 trillion to its assets. These purchases were intended to, and I\nbelieve have, succeeded in significantly lowering longer-term interest rates and raising\nasset prices to help further the Federal Reserve’s economic objectives. This is an easing\nof monetary policy, also known as accommodation, beyond what is provided by\nmaintaining the federal funds rate close to zero.\nIt is important to emphasize that the effects of asset purchases also depend on\nexpectations. If the FOMC buys, say, $10 billion in longer-term securities today but is\nexpected to sell them tomorrow or very shortly, there will be little effect on the economy.\nCurrent research suggests that the effects of asset purchases today depend on expectations\nof the total value of securities the FOMC intends to buy and on expectations of how long\nthe FOMC intends to hold those securities. To make these asset purchases as effective as\npossible in adding accommodation, the FOMC, therefore, needs to communicate the\nintended path of Federal Reserve securities holdings years into the future. I will return in\na moment to current and possible future ways in which the FOMC does and might\ncommunicate this information.\nThe other unconventional policy designed to contribute to monetary easing was\nalmost purely communication--enhanced forward guidance about how long the\n\n- 11 -\nCommittee expects to maintain the federal funds rate near zero. The situation in early\n2009 was similar to 2003 but even more challenging, because in that earlier episode, the\nFOMC at least retained the option of a further reduction in the federal funds rate target.\nIn 2009, communication about the future path of the federal funds rate was the only\noption.\nInitially, the forward guidance was simple and familiar: The FOMC statement\nnoted that “economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the\nfederal funds rate for an extended period.”7 The Committee enhanced its forward\nguidance in August 2011, when it substituted “at least through mid-2013” for the words\n“an extended period.”8 This date was moved into the future several times, most recently\nlast September, when it was shifted to mid-2015.9\nThis “calendar guidance” was an advance over the indefinite “extended period,”\nbut it suffered from an important limitation. The date failed to provide the public with a\nclear understanding of what conditions the FOMC was trying to achieve or the economic\nconditions that would warrant a continuation of the policy. As a consequence, it was\nhard for the public to tell whether a change in the calendar date reflected a shift in policy\nor a change in the Committee’s economic forecast.\nTo help provide greater clarity about the Committee’s objectives, in January\n2012, the FOMC adopted and released a statement of its longer-run goals and monetary\n7 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2009), “FOMC Statement,” press release,\nMarch 18, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20090318a.htm.\n8 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2011), “FOMC Statement,” press release,\nAugust 9, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20110809a.htm.\n9 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC\nStatement,” press release, September 13,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20120913a.htm.\n\n- 12 -\npolicy strategy.10 This statement laid out, for the first time, the rates of inflation and\nunemployment that the FOMC considers consistent with the dual mandate. Specifically,\nit stated that the longer-run inflation goal most consistent with the FOMC’s price stability\nmandate is 2 percent, and that the central tendency of FOMC participants’ estimates of\nthe longer-run normal rate of unemployment ranged from 5.2 to 6 percent.\nAs the statement also made clear, economic developments may cause inflation\nand unemployment to temporarily move away from the objectives, and the Committee\nwill use a balanced approach to return both, over time, to the longer-run goals. On the\none hand, for example, the current rate of unemployment, at 7.7 percent, is far above the\n5.2 to 6 percent range in the statement and is expected to decline only gradually.\nInflation, on the other hand, has been running at or below 2 percent and is expected to\nremain at similar levels for several years. In this circumstance, both legs of the dual\nmandate call for a highly accommodative monetary policy. With unemployment so far\nfrom its longer-run normal level, I believe progress on reducing unemployment should\ntake center stage for the FOMC, even if maintaining that progress might result in\ninflation slightly and temporarily exceeding 2 percent. The Committee reaffirmed this\nstatement in January 2013, and I expect it to remain a valuable roadmap for many years\nto come, indicating how monetary policy will respond to changes in economic\nconditions.11\n10 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC\nStatement of Longer-Run Goals and Policy Strategy,” press release, January 25,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20120125c.htm.\n11 See “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” as amended effective January 29,\n2013, on the Board’s website at\nwww.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf.\n\n- 13 -\nMeanwhile, the FOMC has continued to enhance its communication about how it\nwould use the federal funds rate to return inflation and unemployment to its longer-run\nobjectives. Last December, the Committee replaced its calendar guidance for the federal\nfunds rate with quantitative measures of economic conditions that would warrant\ncontinuing that rate at its current very low level. Specifically, the Committee said it\nanticipates that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate will be appropriate “at\nleast as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between\none and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the\nCommittee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue\nto be well anchored.”12\nI consider these thresholds for possible action a major improvement in forward\nguidance. They provide much more information than before about the conditions that are\nlikely to prevail when the FOMC decides to raise the federal funds rate. As for the date\nat which tightening of monetary policy is likely to occur, market participants, armed with\nthis new information about the Committee’s “reaction function,” can form their own\njudgment and alter their expectations on timing as new information accrues over time.\nThese thresholds will, as a consequence, allow private-sector expectations of the\nfederal funds rate to fulfill an important “automatic stabilizer” function for the economy.\nIf the recovery is stronger than expected, the public should anticipate that one or both of\nthe threshold values will be crossed sooner and, hence, that the federal funds rate could\nbe raised earlier. Conversely, if the outlook for the economy unexpectedly worsens, the\n12 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC\nStatement,” press release, December 12,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20121212a.htm.\n\n- 14 -\npublic should expect a later “liftoff” in rates--an expectation that would reduce longer-\nterm interest rates and thereby provide more-accommodative financial conditions.\nCommunication and Monetary Policy Challenges Ahead\nThe threshold guidance for the federal funds rate looks ahead to a time when the\neconomy has healed from the worst effects of the financial crisis. Getting back to more\nnormal economic conditions will allow for a more normal approach to monetary policy. I\nlook forward to the day when we can put away our unconventional tools and return to\nwhat now seems like the relatively straightforward challenge of setting the federal funds\nrate.\nAt some point it will be appropriate to cease adding to accommodation and, later,\nto begin the process of withdrawing the significant accommodation required by the\nextraordinary conditions caused by the financial crisis. I believe that, once again,\ncommunication will play a central role in managing this transition.\nLet me start with our current program of asset purchases, which was launched in\nSeptember 2012 and revised in December. Notably, the FOMC has described this\nprogram in terms of a monthly pace of purchases rather than as a total amount of\nexpected purchases. The Committee has indicated that it will continue purchases until\nthe outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability.\nIn its most recent statement, the FOMC also indicated that the pace and composition of\nthe purchases may be adjusted based on the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases,\nas well as the extent of progress toward the Federal Reserve’s economic objectives.13 In\nmy view, adjusting the pace of asset purchases in response to the evolution of the outlook\n13 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2013), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC\nStatement,” press release, March 20, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20130320a.htm.\n\n- 15 -\nfor the labor market will provide the public with information regarding the Committee’s\nintentions and should reduce the risk of misunderstanding and market disruption as the\nconclusion of the program draws closer.\nThe Federal Reserve’s ongoing asset purchases continually add to the\naccommodation that the Federal Reserve is providing to help strengthen the economy.\nAn end to those purchases means that the FOMC has ceased augmenting that support, not\nthat it is withdrawing accommodation. When and how to begin actually removing the\nsignificant accommodation provided by the Federal Reserve’s large holdings of longer-\nterm securities is a separate matter. In its March statement, the FOMC reaffirmed its\nexpectation that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain\nappropriate for a considerable time after the current asset purchase program ends and the\neconomic recovery has strengthened.14 Accordingly, there will likely be a substantial\nperiod after asset purchases conclude but before the FOMC starts removing\naccommodation by reducing asset holdings or raising the federal funds rate.\nTo guide expectations concerning the process of normalizing the size and\ncomposition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, at its June 2011 meeting, the FOMC\nlaid out what it called “exit principles.” In these principles, the FOMC indicated that\nasset sales would likely follow liftoff of the federal funds rate. It also noted that, in order\nto minimize the risk of market disruption, the pace of asset sales during this process could\nbe adjusted up or down in response to changes in either the economic outlook or financial\nconditions. For example, changes in the pace or timing of asset sales might be warranted\nby concerns over market functioning or excessive volatility in bond markets. While\n14 See Board of Governors, “FOMC Statement,” March 20, in note 13.\n\n- 16 -\nnormalization of the Federal Reserve’s portfolio is still well in the future, the FOMC is\ncommitted to clear communication about the likely path of the balance sheet.\nThere will come a time when the FOMC begins the process of returning the\nfederal funds rate to a more normal level. In their individual projections submitted for\nthe March FOMC meeting, 13 of the 19 FOMC participants saw the first increase in the\ntarget for the federal funds rate as most likely to occur in 2015, and another expected it to\noccur in 2016. But the course of the economy is uncertain, and the Committee added the\nthresholds for unemployment and inflation, in part, to help guide the public if economic\ndevelopments warrant liftoff sooner or later than expected. As the time of the first\nincrease in the federal funds rate moves closer, in my view it will be increasingly\nimportant for the Committee to clearly communicate about how the federal funds rate\ntarget will be adjusted.\nI hope I’ve been able today to convey the vital role that communication plays in\nthe Federal Reserve’s efforts to promote maximum employment and stable prices.\nCommunication became even more significant after the onset of the financial crisis when\nthe FOMC turned to unconventional policy tools that relied heavily on communication.\nBetter times and a transition away from unconventional policies may make monetary\npolicy less reliant on communication. But I hope and trust that the days of “never\nexplain, never excuse” are gone for good, and that the Federal Reserve continues to reap\nthe benefits of clearly explaining its actions to the public. I believe further improvements\nin the FOMC’s communication are possible, and I expect they will continue.\nIt has been my privilege to share these thoughts with you. Thank you for inviting\nme here today.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n1:00 p.m. EDT\nMay 22, 2015\nThe Outlook for the Economy\nRemarks by\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nProvidence Chamber of Commerce\nProvidence, Rhode Island\nMay 22, 2015\n\nGood afternoon. I am pleased to be with you, and it is good to be back in\nProvidence. As many of you know, I attended Brown University, and the city I see today\nis very different from the one I remember from my time here in the 1960s. Many of\nthose differences reflect dramatic and, at times, wrenching economic changes in Rhode\nIsland over those years, especially since the financial crisis and the Great Recession. As\never, Providence has faced these challenges, and I am impressed by the revival and\nrenewal evident downtown, encouraged by attractions like Waterfire, which bring visitors\nand commerce here and build civic pride.\nToday I would like to speak with you about the outlook for the U.S. economy. I\nshould note at the outset that my remarks today reflect my own views and not necessarily\nthose of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe Recession and the Recovery So Far\nAs you all know, the economy is still recovering from the Great Recession, the\nworst downturn since the terrible episode of the 1930s that inspired its name. The\nrecession began more than seven years ago, the result of the collapse in the housing\nmarket and the financial crisis that it sparked. Rhode Islanders are well aware of the\ngreat toll taken by the recession. The unemployment rate hit 10 percent nationally, and it\nreached 11.3 percent here in Rhode Island. Nationally, payrolls shrank by some 8-1/2\nmillion, about 6 percent, and the 41,000 jobs lost in Rhode Island represented close to\n8 percent of the state’s employment. U.S. economic output fell more than 4 percent\nnationally, the most since the Great Depression, and many of the hardest-hit industries,\n\n- 2 -\nincluding housing construction and manufacturing, are important to the Rhode Island\neconomy.1\nThe Federal Reserve took action to help stabilize the financial system during the\ncrisis, and we have supported the economic recovery with monetary policy actions\ndesigned to hold down longer-term interest rates. With this help, the economy has made\nsignificant strides. The pace of job gains has gradually strengthened, and payrolls\nexpanded by more than 3 million in 2014 alone. The unemployment rate has come down\nsteadily to 5.4 percent in April. One sign of a stronger labor market is that the number of\njob openings has risen impressively, and another is that more workers are quitting their\njobs, signaling greater confidence in their ability to find a new job.\nRhode Island is sharing in this recovery, but I am well aware that economic\nconditions remain difficult here. Rhode Island’s unemployment rate improved very\nslowly during the recovery, and, for a time, it was the highest of any state. The jobless\nrate has come down a lot over the past year or so, but at 6.3 percent in March,\nunemployment here remains above the national average, and payroll employment has yet\nto regain its pre-recession peak.\nIn recent months, some economic data have suggested that the pace of\nimprovement in the economy may have slowed, a topic I will address in a moment. And\neven with the significant gains of the past couple years, it is only now, six years after the\nrecession ended, that the labor market is approaching its full strength.\n1 For a discussion of recent economic developments in Rhode Island, see Mary A. Burke (2014), “Rhode\nIsland in the Great Recession: Factors Contributing to Its Sharp Downturn and Slow Recovery,” Federal\nReserve Bank of Boston, Current Policy Perspectives 14-9 (Boston: FRB Boston, December),\nwww.bostonfed.org/economic/current-policy-perspectives/2014/cpp1409.htm.\n\n- 3 -\nI say “approaching,” because in my judgment we are not there yet. The\nunemployment rate has come down close to levels that many economists believe is\nsustainable in the long run without generating inflation. But the unemployment rate\ntoday probably does not fully capture the extent of slack in the labor market. To be\nclassified as unemployed, people must report that they are actively seeking work, and\nmany people without jobs say they are not doing so--that is, they are classified as being\nout of the labor force. Most people out of the labor force are there voluntarily, including\nretirees, teenagers, young adults in school, and people staying home to care for children.\nBut I also believe that a significant number are not seeking work because they still\nperceive a lack of good job opportunities.\nIn addition to those too discouraged to seek work, an unusually large number of\npeople report that they are working part time because they cannot find full-time jobs, and\nI suspect that much of this also represents labor market slack that could be absorbed in a\nstronger economy. Finally, the generally disappointing pace of wage growth also\nsuggests that the labor market has not fully healed. Higher wages raise costs for\nemployers, of course, but they also boost the spending and confidence of customers and\nwould signal a strengthening of the recovery that will ultimately be good for business. In\nthe aggregate, the main measures of hourly compensation rose at a rate of only around\n2 percent through most of the recovery. And in Rhode Island, average hourly earnings\nhave not risen at all in the past year. Nationally, there are at least some encouraging\nsigns of a pickup so far this year.2 The fact that some large companies, such as Wal-Mart\n2 According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS) employment cost index--which measures both wages\nand the cost of employer-provided benefits--hourly compensation in private industry rose 2-3/4 percent\nover the year ended in March after having averaged gains of about 2 percent per year during most of the\nrecovery. However, some other prominent aggregate wage measures have remained softer. For example,\n\n- 4 -\nand Target, have announced wage increases for their employees also might be a sign that\nlarger wage gains are on the horizon.\nThis improvement in the labor market has brought the economy closer to one of\nthe two goals of monetary policy assigned to the Fed by the Congress--maximum\nemployment. Less progress has been made toward the other goal, price stability.\nConsumer price inflation remains below the Fed’s stated objective of 2 percent. The\nnotion that inflation can be too low may sound odd, but over time low inflation means\nthat wages as well as prices will rise by less, and very low inflation can impair the\nfunctioning of the economy--for example, by making it more difficult for households and\nfirms to pay off their debts. Overall consumer price inflation has been especially low--\nclose to zero--over the past year, as the big fall in oil prices since last summer lowered\nprices for gasoline, heating oil, and other energy products. But inflation excluding food\nand energy, which is often a better indicator of where overall inflation will be in the\nfuture, has also been low, below the Fed’s 2 percent objective both now and for almost all\nof the economic recovery. Inflation has been held down by the continued economic\nweakness during the slow recovery and, more recently, by lower prices of imported\ngoods as well as the fall in oil prices. With oil prices no longer declining, and with the\npublic’s expectations of future inflation apparently stable, my colleagues on the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC) and I believe that consumer price inflation will move\nup to 2 percent as the economy strengthens further and as other temporary factors\nweighing on inflation recede.\nthe BLS’s average hourly earnings for all employees on nonfarm payrolls have increased 2-1/4 percent over\nthe 12 months through April.\n\n- 5 -\nA number of economic headwinds have slowed the recovery, and to some extent\nthey continue to influence the outlook. These headwinds include, first, the fact that the\nhousing crash left many households with less wealth and higher debt, weighing on\nconsumer spending. Many homeowners lost their homes, and many more ended up\n“underwater,” owing more on their mortgages than their homes were worth. Economists\nhave noted that areas of the country that saw a larger boom and bust in housing have\nsubsequently fared worse economically than other areas of the country.3 Rhode Island is\none such place. While the housing bust was not as large here as in Florida, Nevada, and\nparts of California, it was larger than average, and the largest in New England. This\nfactor likely has contributed to the fact that the overall recovery here in Rhode Island has\nlagged.4\nIn some respects, this headwind has diminished. Home prices have moved up\nappreciably in many areas of the country, alleviating the burden for many homeowners,\nthough the improvement in some areas, including Rhode Island, has lagged. Nationally,\nthe share of mortgages that are underwater fell by about one-half between 2011 and\n2014.5 And credit availability for mortgages has improved as well, although mortgages\nare still very hard to obtain for would-be homeowners without pristine credit records. So\nI would score this headwind as still a concern, but one that is likely to continue to fade.\nA second headwind, also quite important here in Rhode Island, has come from\nchanges in fiscal policy to reduce budget deficits. At the federal level, the fiscal stimulus\n3 See Atif Mian and Amir Sufi (2014), House of Debt: How They (and You) Caused the Great Recession,\nand How We Can Prevent It from Happening Again (Chicago: University of Chicago Press).\n4 See Burke, “Rhode Island in the Great Recession,” in note 1.\n5 The share varies by source of data. According to Zillow’s October 2014 Real Estate Market Overview,\nthe share of mortgages in negative equity positions declined from about 30 percent in 2011 to 17 percent in\n2014. According to CoreLogic’s 4th quarter 2014 Equity Report, the share declined from about 25 percent\nto 11 percent over that period.\n\n- 6 -\nof 2008 and 2009 supported economic output, but the effects of that stimulus faded; by\n2011, federal fiscal policy actions became a drag on output growth when the recovery\nwas still weak. Meanwhile, states and municipalities, faced with serious budget problems\ndue to the recession and required by law to balance their budgets, were forced to cut\nspending and raise taxes. The recovery has by now boosted tax revenue in most states,\nthough Rhode Island, I know, is among those areas still facing considerable budget strain.\nOverall, fiscal policy actions at both the federal and the state and local levels look like\nthey are no longer a significant drag on economic growth. So this headwind, I hope, is\nmostly behind us.\nA third headwind has been the restraining influences on the United States from\nthe global economy. I won’t say as much about this factor today, but I will make just a\nfew observations. Initially the euro-area crisis was the biggest headwind coming from\nthe rest of the world. Supported by monetary stimulus, reduced fiscal drag, and\nsignificant institutional reforms, the recovery in the euro area now appears to be on a\nfirmer footing. However, growth in many other parts of the global economy, including\nChina and some other emerging market economies, has slowed. Weak growth abroad,\ntogether with its accompanying implications for exchange rates, has dented U.S. exports\nand weighed on our economy. This headwind too should abate as growth in the global\neconomy firms, supported by monetary policies that generally remain highly\naccommodative.\nFactors Affecting the Outlook\nWith the waning of the headwinds that I have discussed, the U.S. economy seems\nwell positioned for continued growth. Households are seeing the benefits of the\n\n- 7 -\nimproving jobs situation, and consumer confidence has been solid. In addition, the drop\nin oil prices amounts to a sizable boost in household purchasing power. The annual\nsavings in gasoline costs has been estimated at about $700 per household, on average,\nand savings on heating costs--especially here in the Northeast, where it was so cold this\nwinter--are also large.6 Given these energy savings on top of the job gains, real\ndisposable income has risen almost 4 percent nationally over the past four quarters.\nHouseholds and businesses also are benefiting from favorable financial conditions.\nBorrowing costs are low, supported by the Fed’s accommodative monetary policies. And\ncredit availability to both households and small businesses has improved.\nIn recent months, as I noted earlier, there has been some softness in the economic\ndata. Recent indicators of both household spending and business investment have\nslowed, and industrial output has declined. The Commerce Department’s initial estimate\nwas that real gross domestic product was nearly flat in the first quarter of 2015. If\nconfirmed by further estimates, my guess is that this apparent slowdown was largely the\nresult of a variety of transitory factors that occurred at the same time, including the\nunusually cold and snowy winter and the labor disputes at ports on the West Coast, both\nof which likely disrupted some economic activity. And some of this apparent weakness\nmay just be statistical noise. I therefore expect the economic data to strengthen.\nAll of that said, the headwinds facing our economy have not fully abated, and, as\nsuch, I expect that continued growth in employment and output will be moderate over the\nremainder of the year and beyond.\n6 The gasoline figure is from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (2015), Short-Term Energy\nOutlook (Washington: EIA, May), available at www.eia.gov/forecasts/steo.\n\n- 8 -\nDespite the recovery I noted in home prices and a greater number of home sales,\nresidential construction activity remains quite low. I mentioned the ongoing issues with\nmortgage credit, but more generally, many years of a weak job market and slow wage\ngains seem to have induced many people to double-up on housing, and many young\nadults continue to live with their parents. Population growth is creating a need for more\nhousing, whether to rent or to own, and I do expect that continuing job and wage gains\nwill encourage more people to form new households. Nevertheless, activity in the\nhousing sector is likely to improve only gradually.\nThe pace of business investment has also been only modest during this recovery,\nand some of the reasons might persist a while longer. Businesses seem not to have had\nsufficient confidence in the strength and durability of the recovery to undertake\nsubstantial capital expenditures. Moreover, some analysts have suggested that\nuncertainty, not only about the strength of the recovery but also about economic policy,\ncould be a significant factor. And the fact that many businesses seem to be holding large\namounts of cash may suggest that risk aversion is playing a role.\nWeak investment in the energy sector is also likely to persist. This represents the\nnegative side to the fall in oil prices, one being felt by the oil-producing regions of the\ncountry. New domestic oil drilling has plunged over the past few months, and we have\nalso seen a slowdown in activity in sectors that supply oil production companies,\nincluding steel and certain types of machinery. I would add, however, that, on balance,\nthe plusses for energy consumers from the fall in oil prices almost surely outweigh the\nminuses. Remember that we are still a net importer of oil.\n\n- 9 -\nPutting it all together, the economic projections of most members of the FOMC\ncall for growth in real gross domestic product of roughly 2-1/2 percent per year over the\nnext couple of years, a little faster than the pace of the recovery thus far, with the\nunemployment rate continuing to move down to near 5 percent by the end of this year.\nAnd for inflation, as I noted earlier, my colleagues and I expect inflation to move up\ntoward our objective of 2 percent as the economy strengthens further and as transitory\ninfluences wane.\nOf course, the outlook for the economy, as always, is highly uncertain. I am\ndescribing the outlook that I see as most likely, but based on many years of making\neconomic projections, I can assure you that any specific projection I write down will turn\nout to be wrong, perhaps markedly so. For many reasons, output and job growth over the\nnext few years could prove to be stronger, and inflation higher, than I expect;\ncorrespondingly, employment could grow more slowly, and inflation could remain\nundesirably low.\nImplications for Monetary Policy\nGiven this economic outlook and the attendant uncertainty, how is monetary\npolicy likely to evolve over the next few years? Because of the substantial lags in the\neffects of monetary policy on the economy, we must make policy in a forward-looking\nmanner. Delaying action to tighten monetary policy until employment and inflation are\nalready back to our objectives would risk overheating the economy.\nFor this reason, if the economy continues to improve as I expect, I think it will be\nappropriate at some point this year to take the initial step to raise the federal funds rate\ntarget and begin the process of normalizing monetary policy. To support taking this step,\n\n- 10 -\nhowever, I will need to see continued improvement in labor market conditions, and I will\nneed to be reasonably confident that inflation will move back to 2 percent over the\nmedium term.\nAfter we begin raising the federal funds rate, I anticipate that the pace of\nnormalization is likely to be gradual. The various headwinds that are still restraining the\neconomy, as I said, will likely take some time to fully abate, and the pace of that\nimprovement is highly uncertain. If conditions develop as my colleagues and I expect,\nthen the FOMC’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability would best be\nachieved by proceeding cautiously, which I expect would mean that it will be several\nyears before the federal funds rate would be back to its normal, longer-run level.\nHaving said that, I should stress that the actual course of policy will be\ndetermined by incoming data and what that reveals about the economy. We have no\nintention of embarking on a preset course of increases in the federal funds rate after the\ninitial increase. Rather, we will adjust monetary policy in response to developments in\neconomic activity and inflation as they occur. If conditions improve more rapidly than\nexpected, it may be appropriate to raise interest rates more quickly; conversely, the pace\nof normalization may be slower if conditions turn out to be less favorable.\nLonger-Run Growth\nBefore I conclude, let me put this discussion into a longer-term context. The\nFederal Reserve’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability do not, by\nthemselves, ensure a strong pace of economic growth or an improvement in living\nstandards. The most important factor determining living standards is productivity\n\n- 11 -\ngrowth, defined as increases in how much can be produced in an hour of work. Over\ntime, sustained increases in productivity are necessary to support rising incomes.\nHere the recent data have been disappointing. The growth rate of output per hour\nworked in the business sector has averaged about 1-1/4 percent per year since the\nrecession began in late 2007. This rate is down from gains averaging 2-3/4 percent over\nthe preceding decade. I have mentioned the tepid pace of wage gains in recent years, and\nwhile I do take this as evidence of slack in the labor market, it also may be a reflection of\nrelatively weak productivity growth.\nProductivity depends on many factors, including our workforce’s knowledge and\nskills and the quantity and quality of the capital, technology, and infrastructure that they\nhave to work with. Economists debate how optimistic to be about our nation’s\nproductivity prospects. Some argue that the decade starting in the mid-1990s was\nexceptional, with unusually large advances in information technologies, and that the more\nrecent period provides a better guide to the future. Others are more optimistic, suggesting\nthat recent technological innovation remains as impressive as ever, and that history shows\nit may take some years to fully reap the economic benefits of such innovations.7 I do not\nknow who is right, but I do believe that, as a nation, we should be pursuing policies to\n7 For a relatively pessimistic view of productivity growth because “the low-hanging fruit is picked,” see\nRobert J. Gordon (2012), “Is U.S. Economic Growth Over? Faltering Innovation Confronts the Six\nHeadwinds,” NBER Working Paper Series 18315 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic\nResearch, August); and Tyler Cowen (2011), The Great Stagnation: How America Ate All the Low-\nHanging Fruit of Modern History, Got Sick, and Will (Eventually) Feel Better (New York: Dutton). For a\nmore optimistic perspective, see Joel Mokyr (2014), “Secular Stagnation? Not in Your Life,” in Coen\nTeulings and Richard Baldwin, eds., Secular Stagnation: Facts, Causes and Cures (London: CEPR\nPress), pp. 83-89; and Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee (2014), The Second Machine Age: Work,\nProgress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies (New York: W.W. Norton & Company). The\ngreatest return to adopting information technology appears five to seven years after investment, according\nto Erik Brynjolfsson and Lorin M. Hitt (2003), “Computing Productivity: Firm-Level Evidence,” Review\nof Economics and Statistics, vol. 85 (November), pp. 793-808.\n\n- 12 -\nsupport longer-run growth in productivity. Policies to strengthen education, to encourage\nentrepreneurship and innovation, and to promote capital investment, both public and\nprivate, can all be of great benefit.\nIt also is possible that a portion of the relatively weak productivity growth we\nhave seen recently may be the result of the recession itself.8 Firms slashed their capital\nexpenditures during the recession, and as I noted earlier, the increases in investment\nduring the recovery have been modest. In particular, investment in research and\ndevelopment has been relatively weak. Moreover, a lack of financing may have impaired\nthe ability of people to start new businesses and implement new ideas and technologies.\nAs the economy strengthens further, many of these processes could work in reverse,\nboosting our productivity prospects. To the extent this is so, Federal Reserve actions to\nstrengthen the recovery may not only help bring our economy back to its productive\npotential, but it may also support the growth of productivity and living standards over the\nlonger run.\n8 See Dave Reifschneider, William Wascher, and David Wilcox (2015), “Aggregate Supply in the United\nStates: Recent Developments and Implications for the Conduct of Monetary Policy,” IMF Economic\nReview, advance online publication, March 17, http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/imfer.2015.1.

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nCommunity Banking in the 21st Century\nFifth Annual Community Banking Research and Policy Conference\ncosponsored by the Federal Reserve System and Conference of State Bank Supervisors\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nSt. Louis, Missouri\nOctober 4, 2017\n\nI am very glad to welcome everyone here to this conference sponsored by the\nFederal Reserve System and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors. Since the first of\nthese gatherings five years ago, this research and policy conference has established itself\nas an important event where industry leaders, academics, and supervisors discuss the\nlatest research and exchange ideas about promoting a healthy and growing community\nbanking industry.\nAll of us share an interest in seeing that community banks continue their vital role\nin their customers’ lives and in a strong and stable U.S. financial system. The Fed has\nbeen working hard to ensure that its regulation and supervision of banks are tailored\nappropriately to the size, complexity, and role different institutions play in the financial\nsystem. For community banks, which by and large avoided the risky business practices\nthat contributed to the financial crisis, we have been focused on making sure that much-\nneeded improvements to regulation and supervision since the crisis are appropriate and\nnot unduly burdensome.\nOne way we are doing this is through the regulatory review required by the\nEconomic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act, known as EGRPRA. The\nfirst step we took, pursuant to EGRPRA, was to listen to industry and others with a stake\nin how community banks are supervised, which was accomplished through soliciting\nwritten comments and by holding six outreach meetings in 2014 and 2015. Our\nEGRPRA report, issued in March, was focused on community banks, and it noted steps\nthat had already taken place, for example, to simplify Call Report requirements and\nexpand the number of firms eligible for less frequent examinations. Since that report, the\nBoard of Governors, along with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the\n\n- 2 -\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency, has proposed a rule expanding the number of\ncommercial real estate transactions that will no longer require an appraisal, allowing for a\nless detailed evaluation. And just last week, the Fed, along with other regulators, took a\nsignificant step to reduce the regulatory burden on community banks and other smaller\nand less complex institutions by proposing to simplify several requirements in the\nregulatory capital rule.\nWe have done this because we have an abiding commitment to consider how our\ndecisions affect institutions and the customers they serve. We are well aware that\ncommunity banks serve communities, businesses, and households that are often\nunderserved by larger institutions and offer more extensive and more personalized\nservices than are often otherwise available. We know that community bankers are part of\nthe communities they serve, and they are often better able to understand the needs and the\naspirations of their customers.\nWe hope that the research presented at this conference stimulates discussion about\nthe leading policy issues facing the industry and supervisors. As in the past, I see that\nthis year’s agenda includes presentations related to several important issues, including the\neffect of supervision on risk-tasking and the effects of greater competition on community\nbanks. I am cheered to see that finance students at the University of Akron remain\ninterested enough in community banking to participate in a case-study competition\nrelated to community banking, and I am pleased that the conference will hear a\npresentation of the winning case study.\n\n- 3 -\nIn closing, let me thank the conference organizers with the Fed and the\nConference of State Bank Supervisors, the scholars and others making presentations, and\nall of you for attending.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n1:30 p.m. EST\nDecember 19, 2016\nCommencement Remarks\nby\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nUniversity of Baltimore 2016 Midyear Commencement\nBaltimore, Maryland\nDecember 19, 2016\n\nThank you, President Schmoke, for this award and for the opportunity to be here\ntoday to offer my congratulations to the members of the Class of 2016. I would also like\nto recognize the vital support students have received from family, friends, and others,\nmany of whom are here to share this great occasion.\nIn a moment, I will explain why I am particularly proud and honored to be\nspeaking to the new graduates of this university, but first I’d like to address students on a\ntopic that I expect is on the minds of many of you, which is the job market.\nThe short version of what I have to say is that while I expect workers will\ncontinue to face some challenges in the coming years, I believe, for two reasons, that the\njob prospects and career opportunities for new graduates at this time are very good. First,\nafter years of a slow economic recovery, you are entering the strongest job market in\nnearly a decade. The unemployment rate, at 4.6 percent, is near what it was before the\nrecession. This is a level that has been associated with good job opportunities. Job\ncreation is continuing at a steady pace; the layoff rate is low; and job openings are up\nover the past couple years, which is another sign of a healthy job market. There are also\nindications that wage growth is picking up, and weekly earnings for younger workers\nhave made strong gains over the past couple of years. That is probably one reason why\nyounger workers reported feeling significantly more optimistic about the job market\ncompared with 2013, according to a survey published just today by the Federal Reserve.1\nChallenges do remain. The economy is growing more slowly than in past\nrecoveries, and productivity growth, which is a major influence on wages, has been\ndisappointing.\n1 See Board of Governors (2016). In a survey conducted in 2015, 61 percent of young adults reported\nfeeling optimistic about job opportunities, compared with 45 percent who felt that way in 2013.\n\n- 2 -\nBut it also looks like the economic gains of the past few years are finally raising\nliving standards for most people. Median household income grew and poverty fell\nsignificantly in 2015, although these measures were still lagging their levels from before\nthe recession.2 An improving economy may be especially important for you, as new\ngraduates. Those who graduate and enter the workforce during a strong economy are\nmore likely to find employment, remain employed, and enjoy persistently higher\nearnings.3\nThe second reason for optimism is that you have already done the one thing that\nresearch shows is most important to a successful and stable working life: earning the\ndegrees you will receive today. Economists are not certain about many things. But we\nare quite certain that a college diploma or an advanced degree is a key to economic\nsuccess. Those with a college degree are more likely to find a job, keep a job, have\nhigher job satisfaction, and earn a higher salary. The advantage in earnings is large.\nCollege grads’ annual earnings last year were, on average, 70 percent higher than those\nwith only a high school diploma. Back in 1980, the difference was only 20 percent. The\ngap in earnings is significant only a few years after graduation--almost $18,000 a year,\naccording to some recent data. Beyond these advantages, research also shows that a\ncollege or graduate degree typically leads to a happier, healthier, and longer life.4\nOne explanation for the greater advantage in recent decades conferred by higher\neducation is that it reflects an increase in the demand for educated workers compared\n2 For more on median household income adjusted for inflation and the poverty rate, see Posey (2016) and\nBishaw and Glassman (2016).\n3 See, for example, Kahn (2010); Oreopoulos, Von Wachter, and Heisz (2012); and Altonji, Kahn, and\nSpeer (2016).\n4 For recent estimates of the college earnings premium over time, see Pew Research (2014) and Council of\nEconomic Advisers (2016). For a discussion of some nonpecuniary benefits of completing college, see\nOreopoulos and Salvanes (2011).\n\n- 3 -\nwith others. The drivers of this increasing demand for those with college and graduate\ndegrees are likely to continue to be important. Let me mention two of the most\nimportant factors.\nFirst, technology. For decades, technological advances have increasingly allowed\nsimpler, repetitive tasks to be done more cheaply and safely by machines. This kind of\nwork in factories, stores, and offices often required only a high school education. At the\nsame time, technological advances have increased demand for workers with the education\nnecessary to perform the ever-growing share of jobs where technology is important.\nMore recently, further advances are automating increasingly complex tasks and allowing\nworkers with the ability and flexibility to use technology to be more productive. Higher\neducation has also changed in response, and one of the most important things many of\nyou learned at the University of Baltimore was how to learn, adapt, and succeed in the\ntechnology-rich environment of most workplaces.\nThe second major development in the job market is globalization, which allows\ngoods and services to be produced wherever it is most economical. Offshoring and trade\nhave profoundly affected the U.S. economy. No one knows which jobs and which\nindustries will thrive as globalization continues or how each of you will be affected, but I\ncan say that the education you have earned will provide an important advantage. Like\ntechnological change, globalization has reinforced the shift away from lower-skilled jobs\nthat require less education to higher-skilled jobs that require college and advanced\ndegrees. The jobs that globalization creates in the United States, serving a global\neconomy of billions of people, are more likely to be filled by those who, like you, have\nsecured the advantage of higher education.\n\n- 4 -\nWhile globalization will likely continue and technology will continue to advance,\nwe don’t know how fast the economy will grow, what new technologies will be\ndeveloped, or how quickly and consistently employment will expand. What is\nconsiderably more certain, however, is that success will continue to be tied to education,\nin part because a good education enhances one’s ability to adapt to a changing economy.\nOne reason for the increasing economic advantage of a college or graduate degree\nis the very slow growth of earnings in the last few decades for those with only a high\nschool education. It concerns me, as it should concern all of us, that many are falling\nbehind. Improvements in elementary and secondary education can help prepare more\npeople for college and the opportunities college makes available, but for those who do\nnot attend college, we must find other ways to extend economic opportunity to everyone\nin America.\nIn discussing higher education, you may have noticed that I have spoken in terms\nof completing your degrees. Research shows that a large share of the benefits I have\ndescribed from higher education comes only to those who graduate. Even those\ncompleting three or more years of college benefit much less when they don’t get a\ndegree.5 For example, some of you may be worried about paying off loans you have\ntaken out to pay for your education. The good news is that the vast majority of student\nborrowers who complete their degrees find work that allows them to keep up with their\npayments and pay off their loans.\nEverything I have said so far could apply to the graduates this year of any college\nor university. The rest of what I have to say is about you, the 2016 graduates of the\n5 For example, see Oreopoulos and Petronijevic (2013) and Bound and Turner (2011).\n\n- 5 -\nUniversity of Baltimore. I have learned a bit about you recently, with the help of the\nuniversity’s staff. Let me tell you a few things about some of your classmates that you\nmay not know.\nAmong you today is a full-time student who found the time each semester to\nvolunteer with non-profit organizations, including one that helps refugees from other\ncountries find their place in this community. Another of your fellow students, who used\nto doubt that she could ever afford college, has become a student leader. She made the\nDean’s List every semester after transferring from community college.\nLike many of you, another of your fellow graduates took day and evening classes\nto balance work and family demands. She was forced to change jobs to accommodate\nthis schedule. She later decided her future lay in digital communications, which required\nher to switch majors after taking some required classes. Today she will become the first\nperson in her family to graduate from college.\nSome of you were born in other countries. One of you lived in four other\ncountries before coming to the University of Baltimore for a master’s degree. Many of\nyou have contributed to the sense of community at the University of Baltimore by\nactively participating in student life. One of you has even decided to seek a career\nhelping other students as a student affairs professional.\nThese are a few of the outstanding people who will join you in walking across this\nstage today. Let me describe one more.\nTo that student, sitting in the audience, I would say: you deserve a tremendous\namount of credit. Based on what I have learned, you did not have all of the advantages\nthat can pave the way to college and graduate school. You overcame obstacles to make it\n\n- 6 -\nhere, and more obstacles to complete your degree. One of the biggest of these obstacles,\nin fact, was that some people doubted you could or would succeed. But others in your\nlife believed in you. Some of them are here today. They believed in you, and you\nbelieved in yourself, and your talent and intelligence and hard work enabled you to earn\nthe degree you are about to receive.\nIf this sounds like you, then you are absolutely right, because I am not describing\njust one member of the University of Baltimore’s Class of 2016--I am trying to describe\nevery one of you. In different ways, I expect all of you have overcome obstacles and\ndemonstrated resilience and determination to succeed. All of you have gained knowledge\nand used your intelligence and talents to complete your degrees. As impressed as I am\nwith any individual graduating today, I am more impressed with what all of you have\nachieved.\nLet me tell you what else I have learned. More than the students of some colleges\nand universities, I know that many of you have deep roots in this city and in the county.\nMany of you will start careers, build your lives, and raise your families here. The\nchallenges you have overcome are the challenges faced by many people in Baltimore and\nin communities throughout America. Your success, which we celebrate today, is also the\npromise of a brighter future for this city. The degrees you have worked so hard to earn\nand the opportunities now opening up to you represent the stubborn, earnest hope that\nanyone and everyone who strives to succeed still can succeed.\nAnd that is why I consider it a rare privilege to speak to you today, and a great\nhonor to be associated with the University of Baltimore and the members of the Class of\n2016. Thank you, and congratulations.\n\n- 7 -\nReferences\nAltonji, Joseph G., Lisa B. Kahn, and Jamin D.

    "text": "Presentation to Town Hall Los Angeles\nLos Angeles, CA\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor Delivery on March 23, 2010, 12:35 PM Pacific, 3:35 PM Eastern\nThe Outlook for the Economy and Inflation, and the Case for Federal Reserve Independence1\nHello and thank you for coming. I’m very grateful to Town Hall Los Angeles for organizing this\nevent. It gives me an opportunity to explain to you how I see the economy shaping up in the months\nahead. I will also use the occasion to talk about several issues that are high on the public policy agenda\nnow: federal budget deficits and the proper place of the Federal Reserve in our system of government.\nSpecifically, I want to address a concern that I hear people express more and more often: that massive\nfiscal deficits could lead to high inflation. I will lay out my reasons for believing that such fears are\nmisguided. My comments reflect my own views, and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve\ncolleagues.\nTo give you an executive summary, the U.S. economy has bounced back remarkably over the past\nyear, but we still have a long way to go. At the end of 2008, the entire financial system was on life\nsupport, the housing market had collapsed, consumers and businesses were at the edge of panic, and the\nnightmare of a depression seemed like a real possibility. Just a little over a year later, the financial system\nhas stabilized, panic has subsided, and the economy is growing again. But we face important threats to\nthe recovery. In particular, the job market is turning around only slowly, prolonging hardship for millions\nof Americans. The unemployment rate was 9.7 percent in February, down from its recessionary high, but\nstill in very painful territory. My forecast is that moderate growth will continue, inflation will remain\nsubdued, and unemployment will inch down.\nThe past few years have been extraordinarily difficult for many Americans. For a while, it felt as\nthough every morning, we at the Fed woke up to a new crisis. By late 2008, financial markets had seized\n1 I would like to thank John Fernald, Glenn Rudebusch, John Williams, and Sam Zuckerman for assistance\nin preparing these remarks.\n1\n\nup and incoming data showed the economy spiraling downward. Around the middle of last year though,\nthe tide began to turn. In the second half of 2009, production picked up, home and auto sales revived, and\nbusinesses and households started spending again. Now, in especially welcome news, the labor market\ntoo is showing signs of stabilizing.\nOur economy has a natural dynamism and it tends to bounce back after periods of contraction.\nBut the downward spiral we faced a year ago was extraordinarily dangerous, resulting in the most severe\nglobal recession since the Great Depression. In response, the U.S. government and the Federal Reserve,\nlike their counterparts around the world, acted decisively to rescue the financial system, bring down\ninterest rates, and provide a range of emergency support. These policies played a key role in breaking the\ndownward momentum, thereby allowing the economy’s natural dynamism to reassert itself. On the\nmonetary policy side, the Fed has pushed its traditional interest rate lever—the overnight federal funds\ninterest rate at which banks lend to each other—close to zero. And, in order to provide further stimulus,\nwe put in place an array of unconventional programs to speed the flow of credit to households and\nbusinesses. I’ll say more about those monetary actions, as well as the contribution of tax cuts and\nspending increases, later.\nIn many past recessions, such as the very deep one in the beginning of the 1980s, a sharp\ndownturn was followed by a surge in growth and rapidly falling unemployment, a classic V-shaped\nrecovery. This time around though, I don’t think we can count on such a robust V-shaped recovery. A\nnumber of factors underlie this outlook. In a nutshell though, it reflects the financial backdrop to the\nrecession. Growth in the past decade—especially in the overheated housing market—was fueled by easy\naccess to credit. Now credit is harder to come by, which is restraining consumption and the overall\neconomy.\nThe current quarter appears on course to post a moderate annualized growth rate of around 2½ to\n3 percent. The economy should gradually build up strength during the course of the year as households\nand businesses regain confidence, financial conditions improve, and banks increase the supply of credit.\n2\n\nFor the full year, my forecast calls for output to rise about 3½ percent, accelerating to about 4½ percent in\n2011.\nSurveying the economic landscape, most recent data show consumers coming out of their hiding\nplaces. Retail sales rose three-tenths of a percent in February, better than expected. Recent gains in\nconsumer spending have been notable in electronics goods, but have been spread widely across many\ntypes of goods and services. My business contacts tell me that consumers are clearly in a better mood.\nBut they remain cautious and focused on bargains, which may reflect ongoing concerns about jobs,\nincome, and household finances. Before the onset of the recession, the household saving rate was\napproaching zero as tens of millions of Americans funded consumption by taking on debt. Since the\nrecession began, saving has picked up and households have been reducing their debt loads. It’s not clear\nhow much of this reflects the reluctance of banks to lend and how much of it may be due to a more\nconservative mindset among consumers themselves. But either way, I don’t think that the uptick in\nconsumer spending portends a return to the pace of consumption we saw during the go-go years in the\nmiddle of the past decade.\nIt was housing of course that led the economy down. The great bust wiped out some $7 trillion in\nhome values. In the second half of 2009 though, housing showed signs of stabilizing and I became\nhopeful that the sector would provide a significant boost to the economy this year. Now the market seems\nto have stalled. Home prices have been more or less stable since the middle of last year, but new home\nsales have resumed a downward slide and are at very low levels. Existing home sales spiked towards the\nend of last year in response to the homebuyer tax credit and have receded markedly since then. The credit\nexpires this spring, removing an important prop. With sales still weak, builders have little incentive to\nramp up home construction.\nThe continued high pace of foreclosures also creates risks to the recovery of the housing sector.\nMortgage delinquencies and foreclosures are still rising as a consequence of the plunge in house prices\nover the past few years combined with high levels of unemployment. Despite the return to growth of the\nbroader economy, we’ve seen no let-up in the pace at which borrowers are falling behind in their loans.\n3\n\nFurther additions to the already swollen stockpile of vacant homes represent a threat to house prices and\nnew home construction activity.\nIt’s not always easy to understand the dynamics of the housing sector. Last year, for example, the\nshare of mortgages that was 30 to 89 days past due declined. On the face of it, that looked like a hopeful\nsign. Unfortunately, when my staff examined the numbers more closely, it turned out that the drop\nactually represented a worsening of mortgage market conditions. What you want to see is delinquent\nborrowers becoming current. Instead, what happened was that delinquent mortgages moved in the other\ndirection to an even poorer performance status. Many wound up in foreclosure. All in all, I expect that\nthe share of loans that are seriously delinquent will continue to move higher. I am also concerned that we\nhad a temporary reprieve in new foreclosures as the federal government’s trial modification program got\nunder way. But not all of these modifications will stick, which means that some borrowers in the\nprogram could find themselves facing foreclosure again.\nAt the end of this month, the Fed will complete a large-scale program of purchases of mortgage-\nbacked securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Lenders sell mortgages to these two agencies,\nwhich package them as securities sold to investors. Last year, the Fed began buying these securities as\npart of a series of extraordinary measures to promote recovery. At the time the program was announced,\nmortgage spreads over yields on Treasury securities of comparable maturity were very high, reflecting in\npart the disruptions that had occurred in financial markets. I believe that our program worked to narrow\nthose spreads, bringing mortgage rates down and contributing to the stabilization of the housing market.\nFinancial markets have improved considerably over the last year, and I am hopeful that mortgages will\nremain highly affordable even after our purchases cease. Any significant run-up in mortgage rates would\ncreate risks for a housing recovery.\nBusiness investment also presents a mixed picture. We’ve begun to see a rebound in business\nspending on equipment and software, and recent indicators point to solid growth. At the same time\nthough, business confidence remains fragile. It’s very positive that business leaders have shed their\nbunker mentality. But they remain wary and exceedingly cost conscious. Especially for small businesses,\n4\n\nuncertainty continues to weigh on them. Access to credit has improved somewhat, but it’s still a\nsignificant problem for many businesses. My contacts speak of a “new normal,” in which companies\nopen their checkbooks for necessities, but not for items considered discretionary. This of course is much\nbetter than a year ago, when many companies deferred spending even on essentials. But it’s not a recipe\nfor robust growth.\nSo what does all this mean for the job market? That’s something all of us worry about greatly.\nThe U.S. economy has lost 8.4 million jobs since December 2007, equal to a 6 percent drop in payrolls,\nthe largest percentage-point decline in more than 60 years. We should never forget the people behind\nthese numbers—friends, families, and neighbors who are struggling to make ends meet.\nI’m happy to see evidence that the job market is turning around. The pace of job losses has\nslowed dramatically. Had it not been for blizzards back East, we might have seen payrolls expand in\nFebruary. Temporary jobs are growing, and that’s usually a signal that permanent hiring is poised to\nrebound. I was heartened when the unemployment rate dropped in January to 9.7 percent from 10 percent\nthe month before. I was further encouraged when the rate remained at 9.7 percent in February, suggesting\nit was not just a flash in the pan. In the months ahead, we could get a bump in employment from census\nhiring. But that, of course, would be temporary. Given my moderate growth forecast, I fear that\nunemployment will stay high for years. The rate should edge down from its current level to about 9¼\npercent by the end of this year and still be about 8 percent by the end of 2011, a very disappointing\nprospect.\nIn light of these continuing headwinds in the financial system, the housing market, and the job\nmarket, I expect that the economy will be operating well below its potential for several years. Economists\nuse the term “output gap” to refer to an economy that is operating below its potential. We define potential\nas the level where GDP would be if the economy were operating at full employment, meaning the highest\nlevel of employment we could sustain without triggering a rise in inflation. Obviously, with the\nunemployment rate so high, we are very far from that full employment level. In fact, the output gap was\naround negative 6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009, based on estimates from the nonpartisan\n5\n\nCongressional Budget Office, or CBO. That’s an enormous number and it means the U.S. economy was\nproducing 6 percent fewer goods and services than it could have had we been at full employment. In\nview of my forecast of moderate growth and high unemployment, I don’t expect the output gap to\ncompletely disappear until sometime in 2013.\nThis idea of an output gap has important implications for inflation. We have a tremendous\namount of slack in our economy. When unemployment is so high, wages and incomes tend to rise slowly,\nand producers and retailers have a hard time raising prices. That’s the situation we’re in today, and, as a\nresult, underlying inflation pressures are already very low and trending downward. One simple gauge of\nthese trends comes from looking at the U.S. Commerce Department’s price index for core personal\nconsumption expenditures, which excludes the prices of volatile food and energy products. These prices\nhave risen a modest 1.4 percent over the past 12 months, below the 2 percent rate that I and most of my\nfellow Fed policymakers consider an appropriate long-term price stability objective. I just predicted that\nthe output gap might not disappear until 2013. If the economy continues to operate below its potential,\nthen core inflation could move lower this year and next.\nI’d like to switch gears now and talk about federal spending, fiscal stimulus, deficits, and\ninflation. Recent federal budget deficit numbers have been startling. The CBO estimates that in both the\npast fiscal year and this one, the deficit will amount to almost $1.4 trillion. For 2010, that equals about 9\npercent of GDP.2\nI’ve been a critic of large and persistent federal budget deficits throughout my career. I’ve\nworried, in particular, about the growing federal deficits that are projected after the baby boomers leave\nthe workforce. If health-care costs keep rising at the pace we’ve seen in years past, the federal debt could\nrise relative to GDP in a fashion that would eventually become unsustainable. Such long-term deficits\npose a clear threat to our economic well-being. When the federal government borrows on such a massive\nscale over a long time period, it drives up interest rates and sucks up savings that would otherwise finance\nproductive private investments, potentially eroding living standards.\n2 See Congressional Budget Office (2010a).\n6\n\nBut it’s important to keep these concerns in perspective. In times of recession, when private-\nsector demand is insufficient to keep unemployment from rising too high and inflation from trending too\nlow, it’s appropriate for the federal government’s deficit to increase. At such times, reduced taxes and\nincreased expenditures provide crucial support for the economy. That was certainly the case in 2008 and\n2009. Indeed, during economic downturns, much of this support occurs automatically. Recessions\nalways bring lower tax receipts and extra spending for unemployment insurance and other social\ninsurance programs. The CBO estimates that in 2009 such automatic stabilizers added about $300 billion\nto the federal deficit. 3\nBut, in a severe and protracted downturn such as the one we just went through, these automatic\nstabilizers were judged to be insufficient. In both 2008 and 2009, Congress enacted major stimulus\npackages that have added hundreds of billions more to deficits. The 2009 stimulus, for example, directly\nadded about $200 billion, or just under 1½ percent of GDP, to last year’s deficit. Stimulus programs took\na variety of forms. So far, most of the anti-recession stimulus has come as individual and corporate tax\ncuts. There have also been sizeable temporary increases in transfer payments, such as expanded\nunemployment insurance, and grants to state and local governments, as well as increases in direct federal\nspending programs.\nAssessing the effects of this fiscal stimulus on the economy is, of course, challenging, since we\nneed to figure out what the economy would have looked like if we had not had the legislation.\nEconomists use a range of approaches to do these calculations. For example, they look at previous\nexamples of fiscal stimulus, or analyze other variations in spending and taxation. And they develop\ncomputer models to perform simulations. Each method has its strengths and weaknesses, but hopefully,\ntaken together, they capture the plausible range of effects.\nThe CBO recently used a range of approaches to analyze how the 2009 stimulus legislation has\naffected the economy.4 It estimated that, in the fourth quarter of 2009, the stimulus raised the level of\n3 See Congressional Budget Office (2010a), Table F-11.\n4 Congressional Budget Office (2010b).\n7\n\nGDP in the range of 1½ to 3½ percent, and reduced the unemployment rate by ½ to 1 percentage point.\nThat is a very considerable effect. It’s important to remember how dire conditions were in late 2008 and\nearly 2009, and how rapidly the situation was deteriorating. The economic environment at that time was\nas terrifying as any I have ever seen. If the fiscal stimulus helped avert a catastrophe, then I would deem\nit a grand success.\nNow, it’s a year later and the economy is in the midst of a moderate recovery. Much of the\nstimulus spending is still coming on line, so it will continue to boost GDP for a time, but the effect won’t\nbe as pronounced since we are comparing this year’s level to last year’s already boosted level. The CBO\nestimates that the effect on the level of GDP and the unemployment rate peaks this year and then fades.\nSo we can’t rely on the stimulus to power an ongoing recovery. Rather, I am counting on a handoff from\ngovernment-prompted demand to private demand as we go forward.\nIn the next few years, as the economy recovers, the budget picture should improve. Tax receipts\nwill rise and stimulus spending will wind down. So I’m not alarmed by the current enormous deficits. I\nsee them as transitory and recession-related. What I do worry about is the long-term structural deficit that\nwill remain and grow even after the output gap has closed. As I mentioned, much of that long-term\nbudget gap is related to the aging of the population and health-care cost trends. I was born a few years\nafter World War II and people my age represent the leading edge of the baby boom. Tens of millions of\npeople are following close behind. As a result, Social Security and Medicare spending are projected to\nsoar. The CBO currently estimates that Social Security and Medicare will rise from about 8 percent of\nGDP in 2009 to 13 percent by 2035, eventually reaching almost 20 percent of GDP by late this century,\nbased on their benchmark assumptions about trends in health-care costs.5\nNow, many people are thinking about these long-run deficits, and considering alternative ways of\nreducing them. But what different solutions have in common is that they inevitably require us, as a\nsociety, to make tough and painful choices. The recent protests in Greece, where a tough fiscal austerity\nprogram has been imposed, make it clear how difficult these decisions can be.\n5 See Table 1–2 of Congressional Budget Office (2009).\n8\n\nThere is one count, however, on which budget deficits should plead innocent—the charge that\ndeficits will ignite runaway U.S. inflation. I simply don’t believe that’s the case. Concerns that deficits\ncause inflation have a long history. And, indeed, in developing economies, there is plenty of evidence\nshowing that deficits are often inflationary. The logic is that a government can pay for its purchases\nthrough taxes, borrowing, or money creation. In countries with limited ability to collect taxes and where\nfinancial markets may be poorly developed, printing money may be seen as the only way to pay for the\nactivities of government—often with dreadful consequences.\nHowever, in advanced countries with independent central banks, government deficits do not\ncause inflation, either in the short run or in the long run. These links between fiscal deficits and inflation\nhave been studied extensively and the evidence is clear.6 Japan is a case in point. That country has run\nenormous fiscal deficits for many years and its government debt has risen to very high levels. Yet Japan\nhas been the recent textbook case of persistent deflation, not inflation.\nHere’s the rub though. I’ve just asserted that there’s no link between deficits and inflation in\nadvanced countries with independent central banks. The word independent deserves special emphasis\nbecause it is essential to a central bank’s inflation-fighting credibility. As long as monetary authorities\nhave the freedom to fight inflation without interference, then deficits won’t pull them off course. When\nwe examine the evidence from countries around the globe, we clearly see that independent central banks\nhave been more successful in delivering lower inflation.7 Indeed, the purpose of independence is to\ninsulate central bank decision makers from pressures that might distract them from their core monetary\npolicy objectives\nUnder our system in the United States, the Federal Reserve is an independent body shielded from\ninterference from other arms of government. It is assigned two objectives by law: maximum sustainable\nemployment and price stability. The president appoints members of the Federal Reserve Board in\nWashington and the Senate confirms their nominations. The terms of Fed governors were set at 14 years\n6 See, for example, King and Plosser (1985), Sikken and de Haan (1998), and Catão and Terrones (2005).\n7 See Walsh (2003).\n9\n\nso that appointees to these posts would take the long view. In addition, a decentralized system of regional\nFederal Reserve Banks was established in order to ensure that we hear a broad range of views from\naround the country when we set monetary policy, while at the same time buffering us from political\npressure.\nWhy does independence matter? A decision to raise the Fed’s short-term interest rate target may\nbe unpopular. It raises the cost of funds for businesses seeking to borrow, invest, or hire, leads to higher\nmortgage rates, and boosts the cost of government borrowing. And here’s the connection to deficits: In\nthe future, faced with large and persistent federal budget gaps, some people might hope that the Fed\nwould help finance all that fiscal red ink by boosting the money supply and tolerating a higher level of\ninflation. An independent Fed would find it much easier to stay focused on its statutory goals of\nmaximum employment and stable prices. An independent Fed would allow interest rates to rise if needed\nto address inflationary pressures and resist calls to monetize the debt. By contrast, a central bank that\nwasn’t independent might succumb to demands to keep rates low, even if the economy were in danger of\noverheating. To my mind, this is one of the greatest arguments for preserving the Fed’s independence.\nI have seen vividly how independence works in practice. At meetings of the Federal Open\nMarket Committee, the Fed body that makes these interest rate decisions, we have always framed our\ndebates exclusively in terms of how policy moves might affect our objectives of maximum sustainable\nemployment and price stability. We do not take other considerations into account. If economic\ncircumstances call for higher interest rates, we act appropriately. Indeed, I have personally supported an\nincrease in our target for the federal funds rate on 20 different occasions.\nThat said, independence comes with responsibility. We are, quite appropriately, accountable to\nthe government and to the country’s citizens for our performance. In regular reports to Congress as well\nas prompt releases of minutes of our meetings, in speeches and other statements, we aim to provide the\ninformation Congress and the public need to understand how and why we came to our decisions.\nFuture fiscal deficits are not the only source of inflation worries these days. To some people,\ninflation dangers also lurk right on the Federal Reserve’s own balance sheet. Our special programs to\n10\n\nstabilize the financial system and stimulate the economy have pumped up our balance sheet from its pre-\ncrisis level of roughly $800 billion to its current size of more than $2 trillion. In broad terms, the main\nway we expanded our balance sheet was by buying assets such as mortgage-backed securities, paying for\nthem by crediting the sellers, and ultimately the banking system, with reserves—that is, with deposits at\nthe Federal Reserve. Those reserves are the electronic counterpart to cash.\nSo why isn’t creating all this money inflationary, setting up a situation in which too much money\nchases too few goods, as the saying goes? Let me answer this in two ways. First, expanding the Fed’s\nbalance sheet has not, in fact, led to a surge in credit. Lending has been quite restrained. Banks have\nbeen cautious as they seek to return to financial health, keeping much of the money created by this\nexpansion in their accounts with the Federal Reserve.\nSecond, that balance sheet growth and money creation have taken place at a time when the\neconomy has been operating with enormous slack due to insufficient private demand for goods. In other\nwords, the pressures pushing inflation lower arising from underutilization of the economy’s resources\nhave more than offset any upward pressure from our special programs. The net result has been that\ninflation has trended down.\nAs the recovery continues, the Fed will eventually have to make sure that this balance sheet\nexpansion does not lead to inflation. This means that we have to get the timing right for tapering off and\nending our expansionary programs. In other words, we need an exit strategy designed to remove some of\nthe monetary accommodation that is now in place. The question of how we will go about that has been\nthe focus of a lot of commentary. Let me outline for you how we are thinking about our exit strategy.\nTraditionally, the main tool of Fed monetary policy is the federal funds rate, which is what banks\ncharge each other for overnight loans. We have pushed that rate to zero for all practical purposes. This is\nas low as it can go. Such an accommodative policy is currently appropriate, in my view, because the\neconomy is operating well below its potential and inflation is subdued. Consistent with that view, the\nFed’s main policymaking body, the Federal Open Market Committee, last week repeated its statement\nthat it expects low interest rates to continue for an extended period.\n11\n\nAs I noted earlier, in addition to administering standard monetary policy remedies, the Fed has\nput in place an array of unconventional programs to bolster the financial system and stimulate the\neconomy. Among other programs, these have included secured loans to banks and other financial\ninstitutions, and purchases of mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by agencies such as Fannie Mae and\nFreddie Mac.\nThese programs were vital in preventing a complete financial breakdown. But as conditions\nimproved, the need for such extraordinary support diminished. Accordingly, the Fed has already closed\nmany of its emergency lending programs and will soon close the rest. I don’t believe this is yet the time\nto be tightening monetary policy. But as recovery takes firm root and economic output moves toward its\npotential, a time will come when it is appropriate to boost short-term interest rates.\nThe size of our balance sheet raises some technical issues as we begin this process, but these are\nmanageable. When the time arrives to push up short-term interest rates, we won’t have to sell off the\nassets we have acquired, thereby shrinking our balance sheet. We can instead boost short-term rates by\nraising the interest rate that we pay to banks on their reserves held at the Fed. A hike in the rate we pay\non these reserves will cause other short-term money market rates to rise in tandem because banks will be\nunwilling to lend in the money market at rates below what they can earn in their secure Fed accounts.\nEventually, I would like to see the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet shrink toward more normal levels.\nAnd I’d like the bulk of our holdings to be Treasury securities, as they were prior to the crisis. Selling off\nsome of our assets could play a role in this shift, but my expectation is that the FOMC will reduce the size\nof our balance sheet only gradually over time.8\nThe message I hope I’ve conveyed is that I don’t think we’re due for an outbreak of inflation—\nnot in the short run as a result of the Fed’s economic stimulus measures, and not in the long run as a\nconsequence of massive federal budget deficits. If the Fed acts responsibly by unwinding its recession-\nfighting programs in a careful and deliberate manner, then we can avoid an upsurge of inflation in the\nnear term. And as long as the Fed remains an independent central bank free to pursue its objectives of\n8 Bernanke (2010) discusses exit strategies.\n12\n\nmaximum employment and stable prices without interference, then there’s no reason why it won’t be able\nto keep prices stable in years to come.

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“125 Years of Women at Brown Conference”\nsponsored by Brown University\nProvidence, Rhode Island\nMay 5, 2017\n\nThank you, and let me say what an honor it is, as an alumna of this great\nuniversity, to be here today and part of this important occasion.\nAs we celebrate the 125th anniversary of women being admitted to Brown, it\nseems appropriate to reflect on the progress that women have achieved in the intervening\nyears. Since 1891, women have made tremendous strides in their ability to pursue their\ndreams of education and meaningful work and to support themselves and their families.\nIn pursuing these goals, women have helped improve working conditions for all workers\nand have been a major factor in America’s prosperity over the past century and a quarter.\nDespite this progress, evidence suggests that many women remain unable to\nachieve their goals. The gap in earnings between women and men, although smaller than\nit was years ago, is still significant; women continue to be underrepresented in certain\nindustries and occupations; and too many women struggle to combine aspirations for\nwork and family. Further advancement has been hampered by barriers to equal\nopportunity and workplace rules and norms that fail to support a reasonable work-life\nbalance. If these obstacles persist, we will squander the potential of many of our citizens\nand incur a substantial loss to the productive capacity of our economy at a time when the\naging of the population and weak productivity growth are already weighing on economic\ngrowth.\nTo enliven the history I will present today, I will include the experiences of\nwomen graduates of this institution, in most cases in their own words, as related in oral\nhistories preserved by Brown.1 Among these alumnae, I am proud to say, is a member of\nmy own family who was an early graduate of Pembroke, Elizabeth Stafford Hirschfelder\n1 I am grateful for the assistance of Brown University staff in facilitating access to Brown Women Speak,\nthe University’s oral history project, and particularly the help of archivist Mary Murphy.\n\n- 2 -\nof the Class of 1923. Her career and achievements as a mathematician embody both the\nopportunities that opened for Pembroke graduates in the decades after she left here and\nthe limitations many women faced and the compromises she, like so many others, was\nforced to make.\nA Historical Perspective on Women in the Labor Force\nFrom the time that Brown began to accept women and into the 1920s, most\nwomen in the United States did not work outside the home, and those who did were\nprimarily young and unmarried. In that era, just 20 percent of all women were “gainful\nworkers,” as the Census Bureau then categorized labor force participation outside the\nhome, and only 5 percent of those married were categorized as such.2 Of course, these\nstatistics somewhat understate the contributions of married women to the economy\nbeyond housekeeping and childrearing, since women’s work in the home often included\nwork in family businesses and the home production of goods, such as agricultural\nproducts, for sale. Also, the aggregate statistics obscure the differential experience of\nwomen by race. African American women were about twice as likely to participate in the\nlabor force as were white women at the time, largely because they were more likely to\nremain in the labor force after marriage.3\n2 My discussion of the history of female labor force participation draws heavily on the pioneering work of\nClaudia Goldin, including her 2006 Ely Lecture “The Quiet Revolution that Transformed Women’s\nEmployment, Education, and Family” to the American Economic Association and her 1990 work\nUnderstanding the Gender Gap: An Economic History of American Women, from which the statistics on\nfemale labor force participation from the late 19th century until the mid-20th century are drawn. A\nthorough discussion of the quality of these data and their usefulness in making comparisons over time is\nincluded in that work.\n3 The higher participation rates of African American women have been attributed to different cultural\nnorms that developed during slavery and the legacy of slavery, which left blacks impoverished and with\nlow levels of education, making women’s wages an important source of family income (Boustan and\nCollins, 2013; Goldin, 1977).\n\n- 3 -\nWhat was true for women in general was also true of the early graduates of what\nwas then called the Women’s College, the large majority of whom got married, raised\nfamilies, and did not pursue careers. The fact that many women left work upon marriage\nreflected cultural norms, the nature of the work available to them, and legal strictures.\nThe occupational choices of those young women who did work were severely\ncircumscribed. Most women lacked significant education--only 54 percent of girls aged\n5 to 19 were enrolled in school in 1890.4 And women with little education mostly toiled\nas piece workers in factories or as domestic workers, jobs that were dirty and often\nunsafe. Educated women, like those who attended Brown’s Women’s College, were\nscarce. Fewer than 2 percent of all 18- to 24-year-olds were enrolled in an institution of\nhigher education, and just one-third of those were women.5 Such women did not have to\nperform manual labor, but their choices were likewise constrained. Edna McDonald was\na graduate of the Class of 1919, and in her oral history, she summed up the opportunities\nfor her and her classmates: “Let’s be frank,” she said. “What choices did women have?\nTeaching. You could teach. You could be a lab technician. Or you could go into office\nwork and be a secretary. Those were the only real choices.” Margery Chittenden\nLeonard graduated from Pembroke in 1929 and went on to earn a J.D. as the only woman\nin her class at Boston University--after two others withdrew. And with that law degree,\nher first job was as a secretary, and she continued to struggle to find work as a lawyer. In\nher oral history, Doris Madeline Hopkins, a 1928 graduate, talked about the opportunity\n4 U.S. Department of Education (1993).\n5 U.S. Department of Education (1993), p. 76.\n\n- 4 -\nthat she had to work, but also about being told she had to leave her job once she got\nmarried. Indeed, at the time, marriage bars were widespread.6\nThere were notable exceptions, such as, of course, Mary Emma Woolley, a Brown\ngraduate who went on to serve as the president of Mount Holyoke College, and Ethel\nRobinson, the first black woman to graduate from Brown, who taught English at Howard\nUniversity. Helen Butts, from the Class of 1928, taught natural sciences at Smith and\nlater zoology at Wellesley, the beginning of a long and productive career as a biological\nresearcher. Another exception was Betty Stafford, the aunt of my husband, George. She\ngrew up in Providence, earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees at Brown in mathematics\nand then rather adventurously headed west, teaching at two universities in Texas in the\n1920s before completing her Ph.D. and then teaching at the University of Wisconsin.\nDespite the widespread sentiment against women, particularly married women,\nworking outside the home and with the limited opportunities available to them, women\ndid enter the labor force in greater numbers over this period, with participation rates\nreaching nearly 50 percent for single women by 1930 and nearly 12 percent for married\nwomen. This rise suggests that while the incentive, and in many cases the imperative,\nremained for women to drop out of the labor market at marriage when they could rely on\ntheir husband’s income, mores were changing. Indeed, these years overlapped with the\nso-called first wave of the women’s movement, when women came together to agitate for\nchange on a variety of social issues, including suffrage and temperance, and which\nculminated in the ratification of the 19th amendment in 1920 guaranteeing women the\nright to vote.\n6 Goldin (1990), pp. 160-66.\n\n- 5 -\nBetween the 1930s and mid-1970s, women’s participation in the economy\ncontinued to rise, with the gains primarily owing to an increase in work among married\nwomen. By 1970, 50 percent of single women and 40 percent of married women were\nparticipating in the labor force.7 Several factors contributed to this rise. First, with the\nadvent of mass high school education, graduation rates rose substantially.8 At the same\ntime, new technologies contributed to an increased demand for clerical workers, and\nthese jobs were increasingly taken on by women. Moreover, because these jobs tended to\nbe cleaner and safer, the stigma attached to work for a married woman diminished. And\nwhile there were still marriage bars that forced women out of the labor force, these\nformal barriers were gradually removed over the period following World War II.\nAnother innovation was the introduction in the late 1940s of part-time schedules, which\ncombined with the proliferation of modern appliances to make it more feasible for\nmarried women to work outside the home.9\nOver the decades from 1930 to 1970, increasing opportunities also arose for\nhighly educated women, such as the graduates of what was by then called Pembroke\nCollege, to work in professions. That said, early in that period, most women still\nexpected to have short careers, and women were still largely viewed as secondary earners\nwhose husbands’ careers came first. Thus, while it was becoming more common for\nwomen such as Betty Stafford to teach at colleges and universities, their career prospects\nwere not the same as those for men. After earning her Ph.D. at Wisconsin, Betty married\na fellow student and over the next decade coauthored five important papers with him and\n7 Note that for the 1970s and beyond, the participation rate is calculated as a share of those aged 16 and\nolder, whereas for earlier years it is calculated as a share of those aged 15 and older.\n8 Goldin and Katz (2008).\n9 Goldin (2006), pp. 5-6.\n\n- 6 -\na well-regarded reference work. But, while her husband progressed from instructor to\nprofessor at Wisconsin, Betty worked as an instructor on an ad hoc basis. During World\nWar II, while he worked for the government in Washington and New York, Betty stayed\nin Madison, teaching math to servicemen. When he took a job teaching in California\nafter the war, they divorced, and it was only then that she was a given a position as\nassistant professor.\nAs time progressed, attitudes about women working and their employment\nprospects did change. As women gained experience in the labor force, they increasingly\nsaw that they could balance work and family. A new model of the two-income family\nemerged.10 Some women began to attend college and graduate school with the\nexpectation of working, whether or not they planned to marry and have families, as did\nRita Schorr-Germain, an immigrant who survived Auschwitz, graduated from Pembroke\nin 1953, and went on to teach European history while her husband also had a successful\nacademic career. In her oral history, Rita says she was encouraged by many Brown\nprofessors and never considered the possibility that her gender would stand in the way of\nan academic career, a shift in outlook that was becoming increasingly common in the\n1950s. As did most women’s colleges at the time, Pembroke continued to produce\nnurses, schoolteachers, and social workers, and many women who worked only until they\nmarried and had children. But, from the late 1950s on, it also increasingly graduated\nwriters, doctors, lawyers, diplomats, physicians, psychotherapists, and archeologists, and,\n10 For instance, although many women who had joined the war effort in the 1940s were fired at the end of\nthe war, as the Korean War effort picked up and the demand for the labor of women rose, women, who had\nlearned that they could combine work and family were ready to reenter the labor force, so that by the early\n1950s female labor force participation resumed its war-time high (Kessler-Harris, 1982, pp. 302-03).\nMoreover, evidence suggests that sons whose mothers increased their labor force participation in the wake\nof World War II had wives who were more likely to work (Fernández, Fogli, and Olivette, 2004).\n\n- 7 -\nin 1959, the first female faculty member of Brown University. Among those women\nfortunate to attend Pembroke in this era of dramatic change was me. I enrolled at Brown\nfully planning to attend graduate school and have a career, as did many of my classmates\nin the Class of 1967.\nBy the 1970s, a dramatic change in women’s work lives was under way. In the\nperiod after World War II, many women had not expected that they would spend as much\nof their adult lives working as turned out to be the case. By contrast, in the 1970s young\nwomen more commonly expected that they would spend a substantial portion of their\nlives in the labor force, and they prepared for it, increasing their educational attainment\nand taking courses and college majors that better equipped them for careers as opposed to\njust jobs.\nIn surveys of young people about their expectations of their futures, young\nwomen during this era increasingly placed an emphasis on career success.11 Susan\nGraber Slusky of the Class of 1971 said in her oral history that she chose Pembroke for\nBrown’s excellence in chemistry and physics, because she was already planning the\ncareer she went on to have as a researcher. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this is also the period\nin which many all-male colleges admitted women or combined their women’s and men’s\nundergraduate schools, as Brown did when it merged Pembroke and Brown College\nin 1971.\nThese changes in attitudes and expectations were supported by other changes\nunder way in society. Workplace protections were enhanced through the passage of the\nPregnancy Discrimination Act in 1978 and the recognition of sexual harassment in the\n11 Interestingly, over this time young men put increasing weight on family. Goldin (2006), pp. 9 and 11.\n\n- 8 -\nworkplace. Access to birth control increased, which allowed married couples greater\ncontrol over the size of their families and young women the ability to delay marriage and\nto plan children around their educational and work choices.12 And in 1974, women\ngained, for the first time, the right to apply for credit in their own name without a male\nco-signer.13\nBy the early 1990s, the labor force participation rate of prime working-age\nwomen--those between the ages of 25 and 54--reached just over 74 percent, compared\nwith roughly 93 percent for prime working-age men. By then, the share of women going\ninto the traditional fields of teaching, nursing, social work, and clerical work declined,\nand more women were becoming doctors, lawyers, managers, and, yes, professors. As\nwomen increased their education and joined industries and occupations formerly\ndominated by men, the gap in earnings between women and men began to close\nsignificantly.14\nPositive Spillovers from Women’s Increased Participation in the Workforce\nLooking back, the story of the past 125 years is one of slow but steady progress\ntoward women’s full participation in the economy and the fulfillment of their career\ngoals. Unfortunately, the success of women has often been seen as coming at the\nexpense of men. Indeed, regularly in the late 19th and 20th centuries there were calls to\nprotect men from women’s entry into the labor force. The early female graduates of\nBrown faced such attitudes from fellow students and even from faculty. Ruth Pederson, a\n12 See, for example, Bailey (2010) and Goldin and Katz (2002).\n13 The Equal Credit Opportunity Act, passed in 1974, prohibited discrimination in the provision of credit on\nthe basis of gender, race, religion, marital status and national origin. It also disallowed credit providers\nfrom asking women about their plans for future children.\n14 Blau and Kahn (2016).\n\n- 9 -\nmember of the Class of 1919, said some professors did not want to teach women and\nprohibited women from taking their classes. Margery Leonard remembered one Boston\nUniversity professor who urged her to drop out of law school. When she refused, this\nprofessor punished her by forcing her to recite the details of rape and seduction cases\nbefore her jeering, stomping classmates. And it wasn’t only men who had this attitude.\nAmong the women who were fighting for better labor standards early in the 20th century,\nmany were heavily influenced by elite cultural standards that viewed a woman’s place as\nin the home and argued that men should be paid a “family wage” that would allow them\nto support their family singlehandedly--a standard that many working-class families\ncould not afford. Moreover, many of the labor protections promoted to protect women\nwere often based on theories about women’s weaker nature, and these protections served\nto circumscribe their work.15 During the Great Depression, limiting women’s role in the\nworkforce was considered a way to address the high rates of unemployment, although the\nexperience of those years showed the importance of women in supporting their families\nfinancially.16 Similarly, women who had successfully worked during World War II,\neither as part of the war effort or to support their families while their husbands were\nfighting, often were pushed out of their jobs to make room for returning soldiers.17\nAfter the war and then single, my relative, Betty Stafford, remained an assistant\nprofessor at the University of Wisconsin despite an enviable body of research. She\nmarried another Wisconsin professor, an eminent chemist, and collaborated with him on\nhis research. But, in 1954, she gave up her assistant professorship, she said, to be able to\n15 Kessler-Harris (1982), pp. 184-85.\n16 Kessler-Harris (1982), pp. 250-58.\n17 Kessler-Harris (1982), pp. 286-87.\n\n- 10 -\naccompany her husband on his frequent international travels. Betty later moved with her\nhusband to California, and after his death, she endowed a graduate fellowship in the\nsciences and a prize in theoretical chemistry. Although Betty’s accomplishments were\nconsiderable, against the backdrop of increasing opportunity for women over her lifetime\nI believe that Betty Stafford Hirschfelder was denied opportunities and greater success\nsimply because she was a woman.\nDespite the fears of some that women entering into the workforce would crowd\nout men, the evidence shows that the rise in women’s participation has contributed to\nwidespread improvements in the safety and productivity of our workplaces, to the health\nof families, and to the macroeconomic success that our country has enjoyed over the past\n125 years.\nIn the first decades of the 20th century, the struggle to improve the working\nconditions of young women drawn into factories was a pillar of the overall movement\ntoward improved labor standards. Women’s demands for safer factories, humane\nworkweeks, and higher pay, which were often pursued through organizing and striking,\ncontributed substantially to the social upheaval and public debate of that period that\neventually led to the passage of stronger labor standards. These efforts also produced\ngenerations of women who went on to be leaders in the broader labor movement and in\nthe broader movements for equality.\nThe rise in female labor force participation was an early focus of and helped\nestablish the fields of statistics and labor economics in their modern incarnations. Carroll\nWright, the first commissioner of what is now known as the Bureau of Labor Statistics\nand who established the high standards for data collection and analysis for which the\n\n- 11 -\nbureau is known, devoted his agency’s fourth annual report, for the year 1888, to the\ntopic of Working Women in Large Cities.18 Moreover, the issues surrounding women’s\nwork, such as the minimum wage, pay equity, and maximum workweeks, were topics of\ngreat interest to early practitioners of labor economics.19\nIt is often said that we should welcome women’s presence in the workplace\nbecause it allows us to capitalize on the talents of our entire population, and this is\ncertainly true. But it is also good business. A number of studies on how groups perform\nindicate that workforces that vary on dimensions such as gender, race, and ethnicity\nproduce better decisionmaking processes and better outcomes.20\nEvidence also suggests that women’s work has positive spillovers to their family\nlives and to the success of their children, which in turn benefits all of society. It is a well-\nestablished finding in the literature on development that maternal education and work are\npositively associated with better health and educational outcomes for children.21 A\nrecent meta-study also suggests that children in the United States with working mothers\ndo as well if not better in school, both academically and behaviorally, than children with\nmothers that stay home full time. This effect is particularly strong for families that have\nfewer social and economic resources, including single-parent families.22 As time goes\non, girls with working mothers are more likely to be employed and hold supervisory\npositions, and they earn somewhat more. In addition, sons raised in families with\n18 Bureau of Labor (1889).\n19 Goldin (2006), p. 4.\n20 See the discussion of this literature on pp. 232-33 of Bayer and Rouse (2016) and the studies cited\ntherein.\n21 See, for example, World Bank (2012).\n22 Lucas-Thompson, Goldberg, and Prause (2010).\n\n- 12 -\nworking mothers assume greater childcare responsibilities as adults than sons whose\nmothers did not work.23\nThis is not to say that children do not need attention from both parents to develop\ninto academically successful and socially well-adjusted adults--they certainly do. Also,\nas I will discuss, women are making choices that reflect their desire to balance work and\nfamily. These findings bear on the question of how best to support women’s work\nthrough public policies aimed at helping women and men better manage work and family.\nFrom a macroeconomic perspective, women’s incorporation into the economy\ncontributed importantly to the rapid rise in economic output and well-being over the\n20th century. Between 1948 and 1990, the rise in female participation contributed about\n1/2 percentage point per year to the potential growth rate of real gross domestic\nproduct.24 And this estimate does not take into account the effect of the increases in\nwomen’s education and work experience that also occurred over that period and boosted\ntheir productivity. In addition, since 1979, women have accounted for a majority of the\nrise in real household income. In dollar terms, the gains were greatest for households in\nthe top third of the earnings distribution, but without the increase in women’s earnings,\nfamilies in the bottom and middle thirds of the distribution would have experienced\ndeclines.25\nRemaining Challenges and Some Possible Solutions\nI have argued thus far that we, as a country, have reaped great benefits from the\nincreasing role that women have played in the economy. But evidence suggests that\n23 McGinn, Ruiz Castro, and Lingo (2015).\n24 Board staff calculation using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n25 Boushey and Vaghul (2016).\n\n- 13 -\nbarriers to women’s continued progress remain. The participation rate for prime\nworking-age women peaked in the late 1990s and currently stands at about 75 percent.26\nOf course, women, particularly those with lower levels of education, have been affected\nby the same economic forces that have been pushing down participation among men,\nincluding technical change and globalization. 27 However, women’s participation\nplateaued at a level well below that of prime working-age men, which stands at over\n88 percent. While some married women choose not to work, the size of this disparity\nshould lead us to examine the extent to which structural problems, such as a lack of equal\nopportunity and challenges to combining work and family, are holding back women’s\nadvancement.\nAs I mentioned earlier, the gap in earnings between men and women has\nnarrowed substantially, but progress has slowed lately, and women working full time still\nearn about 17 percent less than men, on average, each week.28 Even when we compare\nmen and women in the same or similar occupations who appear nearly identical in\nbackground and experience, a gap of about 10 percent typically remains.29 As such, we\ncannot rule out that gender-related impediments hold back women, including outright\n26 The labor force participation rate for all women declined from a peak of 60 percent in 1999 and 2000 and\nnow stands a bit below 57 percent. However, as has been documented elsewhere, much of the decline for\nall women can be explained by the aging of the baby boomers into their retirement years and lower\nparticipation among teens and young adults. It is also possible that the labor force participation rate is still\nbeing held down a bit by the waning effects of the Great Recession. Aaronson and others (2014).\n27 Aaronson and others (2014). Also see Council of Economic Advisers (2016) and the studies cited\ntherein.\n28 Blau and Kahn (2016).\n29 Manning and Swaffield (2008) find that although men and women enter the British labor force earning\nthe same amount, among those who worked continuously and full time for 10 years, women would still\nearn 8 percent less than men, even if they have the same personality traits, were childless, and profess no\ninterest in having children. Also see Blau and Kahn (2016) and Noonan, Corcoran, and Courant (2005).\n\n- 14 -\ndiscrimination, attitudes that reduce women’s success in the workplace, and an absence\nof mentors.\nRecent research has shown that although women now enter professional schools\nin numbers nearly equal to men, they are still substantially less likely to reach the highest\nechelons of their professions.30 For instance, 47 percent of students at top-50 law schools\nare female, and women obtain 40 percent of M.B.A.’s from top programs. Nonetheless,\nwomen are still poorly represented among corporate CEOs, as partners in top law firms,\nand as executives in finance.31 Even in my own field of economics, women constitute\nonly about one-third of Ph.D. recipients, a number that has barely budged in two\ndecades.32 This lack of success in climbing the professional ladder would seem to\nexplain why the wage gap actually remains largest for those at the top of the earnings\ndistribution.33\nOne of the primary factors contributing to the failure of these highly skilled\nwomen to reach the tops of their professions and earn equal pay is that top jobs in fields\nsuch as law and business require longer workweeks and penalize taking time off. This\nwould have a disproportionately large effect on women, who continue to bear the lion’s\nshare of domestic and child-rearing responsibilities.34 Within academia, the short\ntimeframe in which assistant professors have to prove themselves good candidates for\n30 Moran (2015); Olson (2016).\n31 On the status of women in finance and corporations see Bertrand, Goldin, and Katz (2010) and the\nstudies cited therein. For law partnerships, see New York City Bar Association (2016).\n32 Bayer and Rouse (2016), p. 223.\n33 Blau and Kahn (2016).\n34 Bertrand, Goldin, and Katz (2010); Goldin (2014).\n\n- 15 -\ntenure by publishing typically overlaps with the period in which many women\ncontemplate starting a family, forcing difficult trade-offs.35\nEmployers may require the long hours and short absences for good reasons--for\ninstance, the work may involve relationships with clients or accumulating a significant\namount of knowledge about a deal or case in a condensed period of time. If it is costly\nfor employees to share information and split the work, then there would be a high\npremium, in the form of compensation, for those who can work the long hours.36\nWorkplaces where the income of employees depends on the effort of co-workers, such as\nlaw partnerships, also have an incentive to require long workweeks.37\nBut however sensible such arrangements may be from a business perspective, it\ncan be difficult for women to meet the demands in these fields once they have children.\nThe very fact that these types of jobs require such long hours likely discourages some\nwomen--as well as men--from pursuing these career tracks. Advances in technology\nhave facilitated greater work-sharing and flexibility in scheduling, and there are further\nopportunities in this direction.38 Economic models also suggest that while it can be\ndifficult for any one employer to move to a model with shorter hours, if many firms were\nto change their model, they and their workers could all be better off.39\nOf course, most women are not employed in fields that require such long hours or\nthat impose such severe penalties for taking time off. But the difficulty of balancing\nwork and family is a widespread problem. In fact, the recent trend in many occupations\n35 Unfortunately, in contrast to some of the successful gender neutral policies I discuss below, efforts to\naddress the tenure problem by giving all new parents extra time before the tenure decision has actually had\nthe effect of reducing female tenure rates and raising those of men. Antecol, Bedrard and Stearns, (2016).\n36 Goldin (2014).\n37 See, for example, Akerlof (1976) and Landers, Rebitzer, and Taylor (1996).\n38 See the discussion in Goldin (2014), p. 117.\n39 Landers, Rebitzer, and Taylor (1996), p. 334.\n\n- 16 -\nis to demand complete scheduling flexibility, which can result in too few hours of work\nfor those with family demands and can make it difficult to schedule childcare.40 Reforms\nthat encourage companies to provide some predictability in schedules, cross-train\nworkers to perform different tasks, or require a minimum guaranteed number of hours in\nexchange for flexibility could improve the lives of workers holding such jobs. Another\nproblem is that in most states, childcare is affordable for fewer than half of all families.41\nAnd just 5 percent of workers with wages in the bottom quarter of the wage distribution\nhave jobs that provide them with paid family leave.42 This circumstance puts many\nwomen in the position of having to choose between caring for a sick family member and\nkeeping their jobs.\nIn this context, it is useful to compare the workforce experiences of American\nwomen to those in other advanced economies. In 1990, the labor force participation rate\nin the United States of prime working-age women, 74 percent, was higher than in all but\na few industrialized nations. But in the intervening years, while the participation rate of\nU.S. women was roughly stable, elsewhere it increased steadily, and by 2010 the United\nStates fell to 17th place out of 22 advanced economies with respect to female labor force\nparticipation.43 A number of studies have examined the role of various public policies in\nexplaining patterns in female labor force participation across countries. These studies\nfind that policy differences--in particular, the expansion of paid leave following\nchildbirth, steps to improve the availability and affordability of childcare, and increased\navailability of part-time work--go a long way toward explaining the divergence between\n40 Cajner and others (2014); Lambert, Haley-Lock, and Henly (2012).\n41 Bivens and others (2016).\n42 Bureau of Labor Statistics (2016).\n43 Blau and Kahn (2013).\n\n- 17 -\nadvanced economies.44 Evidence suggests that if the United States had policies in place\nsuch as those employed in many European countries, female labor force participation\ncould be as high as 82 percent.45\nHowever, these policies entail tradeoffs. Women in other advanced economies\nare more likely than women in the United States to be employed part time, which could\nreflect a greater ease in arranging flexible schedules and more time with family, but it\nalso comes with costs, including a wage penalty and fewer opportunities for training and\nadvancement. Such findings raise the question of whether the policies enacted overseas\nin recent years have had the unintended consequence of making it more expensive for\nemployers there to hire women into full-time jobs with opportunities for advancement, as\nwomen are more likely to be eligible for and to make use of such benefits.46\nThis possibility should inform our own thinking about policies to make it easier\nfor women and men to combine their family and career aspirations. For instance,\nimproving access to affordable and good quality childcare would appear to fit the bill, as\nit has been shown to support full-time employment.47 Recently, there also seems to be\nsome momentum for providing families with paid leave at the time of childbirth. The\nexperience in Europe suggests picking policies that do not narrowly target childbirth, but\ninstead can be used to meet a variety of the health and caregiving responsibilities.48\n44 Note that Blau and Kahn (2013) do not find that improvement in the provision of childcare in other\nadvanced economies relative to the United States explain the divergence in participation since the 1990s;\nhowever, Thévenon (2013) finds that the greater provision of childcare has a positive effect on full-time\nemployment.\n45 Blau and Kahn (2013), p. 7.\n46 In most European countries, men are significantly less likely than women to use paid parental leave,\nalthough in a few countries, including Sweden and Iceland, over 40 percent of users of parental leave are\nmen (OECD, 2016).\n47 Thévenon (2013), p. 26.\n48 In testimony before the Joint Economic Committee and the House Subcommittee on the Federal\nWorkforce, Postal Service, and the District of Columbia, a breakdown of claims on New Jersey’s short-\n\n- 18 -\nConclusion\nThe United States faces a number of longer-term economic challenges, including\nthe aging of the population and the low growth rate of productivity. One recent study\nestimates that increasing the female participation rate to that of men would raise our gross\ndomestic product by 5 percent.49 And, as I have argued, our workplaces and families, as\nwell as women themselves, would benefit from continued progress. However, a number\nof factors, which I have only had a chance to touch upon, appear to be holding women\nback, including the difficulty women currently have in trying to combine their careers\nwith other aspects of their lives, including caregiving. In looking to solutions, we should\nconsider improvements to work environments and policies that benefit not only women,\nbut all workers. Pursuing such a strategy would be in keeping with the story of the rise in\nwomen’s involvement in the workforce, which, as I have described here, has contributed\nnot only to their own well-being but more broadly to the welfare and prosperity of our\ncountry.\nThe title for my remarks today, “So We All Can Succeed,” was inspired by\nMalala Yousafzai, the advocate for girls’ and women’s education, who said, “We cannot\nall succeed when half of us are held back.”50 Brown University has played its own role\nby admitting women 125 years ago, by educating many thousands of women over the\nterm disability program in 2000 showed that pregnancy and childbirth constituted just 15 percent of all\nclaims (Lovell, 2008).\n49 Aguirre and others (2012).\n50 Yousafzai (2013), paragraph 22.\nNote: On May 5, 2017, a typo was corrected to change 83 to 93 in the following sentence on page 8: “By\nthe early 1990s, the labor force participation rate of prime working-age women--those between the ages of\n25 and 54--reached just over 74 percent, compared with roughly 83 percent for prime working-age men.”\n\n- 19 -\ndecades, and by continuing to be a place that equips men and women with the means to\nmake our nation and the world a better place.\n\n- 20 -\nReferences\nAaronson, Stephanie, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis-Reig, Christopher\nSmith, and William Wascher (2014). “Labor Force Participation: Recent\nDevelopments and Future Prospects,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity,\nFall, pp. 197-275, https://www.brookings.edu/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2016/07/Fall2014BPEA_Aaronson_et_al.pdf.\nAguirre, DeAnne, Leila Hoteit, Christine Rupp, and Karim Sabbagh (2012).\nEmpowering the Third Billion: Women and the World of Work in 2012.

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Executives’ Club of Chicago\nChicago Hilton\n720 S. Michigan Avenue\nChicago, Illinois\nMarch 3, 2017\n\nI am pleased to join you today to discuss the U.S. economy and the Federal\nReserve’s monetary policy. I strongly believe that my colleagues and I should explain, as\nclearly as we can, both the reasons for our decisions and the fundamental principles that\nunderlie our strategy.\nToday I will review the conduct of monetary policy during the nearly 10 years\nsince the onset of the financial crisis. Although the Federal Reserve’s policy strategy for\nsystematically pursuing its congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment\nand price stability has not changed during this period, the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) has made significant tactical adjustments along the way. I will\nspend most of my time today discussing the rationale for the adjustments the Committee\nhas made since 2014, a year that I see as a turning point, when the FOMC began to\ntransition from providing increasing amounts of accommodation to gradually scaling it\nback.\nThe process of scaling back accommodation has so far proceeded at a slower pace\nthan most FOMC participants anticipated in 2014. Both unexpected economic\ndevelopments and deeper reevaluations of structural trends affecting the U.S. and global\neconomies prompted us to reassess our views on the outlook and associated risks and,\nconsequently, the appropriate stance of monetary policy, both in the near term and the\nlonger run. Looking ahead, we continue to expect the evolution of the economy to\nwarrant further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate. However,\ngiven how close we are to meeting our statutory goals, and in the absence of new\ndevelopments that might materially worsen the economic outlook, the process of scaling\nback accommodation likely will not be as slow as it was in 2015 and 2016.\n\n- 2 -\nI should note that I will discuss the process of scaling back accommodation\nmostly from the perspective of our interest rate decisions, which my FOMC colleagues\nand I see as our primary tool for actively adjusting the stance of monetary policy when\nour actions are not constrained by the zero lower bound on short-term interest rates.1\nAssessing the Degree of Monetary Policy Accommodation\nIn our monetary policy deliberations, the FOMC always faces two fundamental\nquestions: First, how do we assess the current stance of monetary policy? Second, what\nare the strategic and tactical considerations that underpin our decisions about the\nappropriate stance of monetary policy going forward? These questions are difficult\nbecause the interactions between monetary policy and the economy are complex. Policy\naffects the economy through many different channels, and, in turn, many factors\ninfluence the appropriate course of policy.\nGauging the current stance of monetary policy requires arriving at a judgment of\nwhat would constitute a neutral policy stance at a given time. A useful concept in this\nregard is the neutral “real” federal funds rate, defined as the level of the federal funds rate\nthat, when adjusted for inflation, is neither expansionary nor contractionary when the\neconomy is operating near its potential. In effect, a “neutral” policy stance is one where\nmonetary policy neither has its foot on the brake nor is pressing down on the accelerator.\nAlthough the concept of the neutral real federal funds rate is exceptionally useful in\nassessing policy, it is difficult in practical terms to know with precision where that rate\n1 When the federal funds rate was near zero and we felt the economy still needed more support, the FOMC\nacted, beginning in 2008, to purchase longer-term securities. Although we stopped increasing the size of\nour securities portfolio in 2014, we have been reinvesting principal payments from our securities holdings\never since. We have said that we expect to maintain this policy until normalization of the level of the\nfederal funds rate is well under way. We have also said that, when it becomes appropriate to reduce the\nsize of our balance sheet, we will do so primarily by letting maturing assets run off our balance sheet.\n\n- 3 -\nstands. As a result, and as I described in a recent speech, my colleagues and I consider a\nwide range of information when assessing that rate.2 As I will discuss, our assessments\nof the neutral rate have significantly shifted down over the past few years.\nIn the Committee’s most recent projections last December, most FOMC\nparticipants assessed the longer-run value of the neutral real federal funds rate to be in\nthe vicinity of 1 percent.3 This level is quite low by historical standards, reflecting, in\npart, slow productivity growth and an aging population not only in the United States, but\nalso in many advanced economies. Moreover, the current value of the neutral real\nfederal funds rate appears to be even lower than this longer-run value because of several\nadditional headwinds to the U.S. economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis, such as\nsubdued economic growth abroad and perhaps a lingering sense of caution on the part of\nhouseholds and businesses in the wake of the trauma of the Great Recession.\nIt is difficult to say just how low the current neutral rate is because assessments of\nthe effect of post-recession headwinds on the current level of the neutral real rate are\nsubject to a great deal of uncertainty. Some recent estimates of the current value of the\nneutral real federal funds rate stand close to zero percent.4 With the actual value of the\nreal federal funds rate currently near minus 1 percent, a near-zero estimate of the neutral\nreal rate means that the stance of monetary policy remains moderately accommodative,\nan assessment that is consistent with the fact that employment has been growing at a\npace--around 180,000 net new jobs per month--that is notably above the level estimated\n2 See Yellen (2017).\n3 This estimate of the neutral real federal funds rate is based on the difference between the medians of the\nlonger-run projections for the federal funds rate and inflation submitted by individual FOMC participants\nfor the December 2016 FOMC meeting. The most recent Summary of Economic Projections, an addendum\nto the minutes of that meeting, is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20161214ep.htm.\n4 See, for instance, Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2016).\n\n- 4 -\nto be consistent with the longer-run trend in labor force growth--between 75,000 and\n125,000 per month.5 As I will explain, this policy stance seems appropriate given that\nthe underlying trend in inflation appears to be still running somewhat below 2 percent.\nBut as that gap closes, with labor market conditions now in the vicinity of our maximum\nemployment objective, the Committee considers it appropriate to move toward a neutral\npolicy stance.\nMy colleagues and I generally anticipate that the neutral real federal funds rate\nwill rise to its longer-run level over the next few years. This expectation partly underlies\nour view that gradual increases in the federal funds rate will likely be appropriate in the\nmonths and years ahead: Those increases would keep the economy from significantly\noverheating, thereby sustaining the expansion and maintaining price stability.\nPost-Crisis Period: Same Strategy, New Tactics\nI will now examine the strategic and tactical considerations that go into FOMC\ndeliberations by discussing past monetary policy decisions in the context of our mandate\nfrom the Congress to pursue maximum employment and price stability.\nThe FOMC’s monetary policy strategy is based on three basic principles. First,\nour monetary policy must be goal driven. We must take care to ensure that our decisions\nover time are consistent with our commitment to achieve the Federal Reserve’s\ncongressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability, and that the\npublic understands and has confidence in that commitment. Second, our monetary policy\nmust be forward looking because our decisions tend to influence economic activity and\n5 The estimate of the actual value of the real federal funds rate (around minus 1 percent) is based on the\ndifference between the current value of the effective federal funds rate (close to 0.66 percent) and the latest\nreading on inflation as measured by the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption\nexpenditures excluding energy and food items (1-3/4 percent).\n\n- 5 -\ninflation with a substantial lag. Among other things, this implies looking through short-\nterm and transitory developments and focusing on the medium-term outlook--roughly\ntwo or three years out--when making policy decisions. Third, our monetary policy must\nbe risk sensitive. Because the outlook is uncertain, we must assess appropriate policy\nwith an eye toward the risk that our expectations about the economy turn out to be\nsignificantly wrong.\nWe have followed this basic strategy for decades and, in 2012, the FOMC\nformalized it in our “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.”6\nThe Committee has reaffirmed this commitment annually. But the challenges brought\nabout by the financial crisis, and the very deep recession and painfully slow recovery that\nfollowed, compelled us to adjust our tactics for carrying out our policy strategy. In\nparticular, once the Committee had cut the federal funds rate to near zero in late 2008, it\nbecame necessary to deploy new tools to supply the considerable monetary\naccommodation required by the extremely weak state of the job market and persistently\nlow inflation.7 Those tools--especially our large-scale securities purchases and\nincreasingly explicit forward guidance pertaining to the likely future path of the federal\nfunds rate--enabled the Federal Reserve to provide necessary additional support to the\nU.S. economy by pushing down longer-term interest rates and easing financial conditions\nmore generally.\nMuch has been written and said already about the provision of additional\naccommodation between 2008 and 2014, when the FOMC completed its latest round of\n6 The Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf.\n7 See Yellen (2016).\n\n- 6 -\nlarge-scale securities purchases, so I will turn now to our policy stance since 2014, when\nthe FOMC’s main focus started to shift from providing additional accommodation to\nscaling it back.8\n2014: A Turning Point for Monetary Policy\nBy late 2013, the FOMC concluded that the economy had made sufficient\nprogress, and the outlook was sufficiently favorable, that it should reduce the pace of its\nlarge-scale securities purchases. But we reiterated that these purchases would continue\nuntil the outlook for the labor market had improved substantially. The U.S. economy\nmade notable progress toward the FOMC’s statutory goals during 2014, with the\nunemployment rate dropping to close to 6 percent by mid-year--well below its Great-\nRecession peak of 10 percent--and other measures of labor market conditions also\nshowing improvement: Payroll gains were solid; job openings had risen significantly;\nand the number of workers voluntarily quitting their jobs--a sign of confidence in the\nlabor market--was rising back toward pre-crisis levels. We were also seeing progress on\nachieving our price stability goal: Total inflation as measured by changes in the headline\npersonal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index reached about 1-3/4 percent by\nmid-2014 after hovering around 1 percent in the fall of 2013. Inflation seemed to be\nmoving toward the FOMC’s 2 percent objective, a level that the FOMC judges to be\nconsistent with price stability because it is low enough that it does not need to figure\nprominently into people’s and businesses’ economic decisions but high enough to serve\nas a buffer against deflation and provide greater scope for monetary policy to address\neconomic weakness.\n8 For a discussion of our monetary policy during the 2008-14 period, see, for instance, Engen, Laubach, and\nReifschneider (2015).\n\n- 7 -\nThe progress seen during 2014 indicated to the FOMC that it was no longer\nnecessary to provide increasing amounts of support to the U.S. economy by continuing to\nadd to the Federal Reserve’s holdings of longer-term securities. Accordingly, the\nCommittee continued to reduce the pace of asset purchases over the course of the year,\nending its purchases in October. That step, however, did not mark an immediate shift\ntoward tighter monetary policy because we also indicated then that we did not expect to\nraise interest rates for a considerable time after the end of our securities purchases.\nMoreover, as the Committee explained in a set of “normalization principles” issued that\nSeptember, the intention was to maintain the overall size of the Federal Reserve’s balance\nsheet at an elevated level until sometime after the FOMC had begun to raise its target for\nthe federal funds rate.9 We decided that maintaining a highly accommodative stance of\nmonetary policy remained appropriate because, while the U.S. economy was stronger and\ncloser to meeting our statutory goals, we saw significant room for improvement. In\nparticular, the unemployment rate still stood above our assessment of its longer-run\nnormal level--that is, the unemployment rate that we expect to prevail when the economy\nis operating at maximum employment--and inflation remained below the 2 percent\nobjective.\nBecause my colleagues and I expected that labor market conditions would\ncontinue to improve and that inflation would move back to 2 percent over the medium\n9 The FOMC’s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans are available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140917c.htm.\nSeveral studies support the notion that maintaining the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet at an\nelevated level is consistent with keeping a highly accommodative policy stance, particularly when short-\nterm interest rates are close to zero, as it was the case in 2014--see, for instance, D’Amico and others\n(2012) and many of the references in Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015). Large Federal Reserve\nholdings of longer-term securities reduce the total amount of such securities available for purchase by the\npublic, exerting upward pressure on their prices and, thus, depressing their yields and contributing to lower\nborrowing costs for American families and businesses.\n\n- 8 -\nterm, we anticipated that the time was approaching when the economy would be strong\nenough that we should start to scale back our support. Indeed, the FOMC’s June 2014\nSummary of Economic Projections (SEP) reported that nearly all FOMC participants saw\na higher federal funds rate as appropriate in the next calendar year. In contrast, only two\nparticipants in December 2013 thought that it would be appropriate to start raising that\nrate in the next calendar year.\nUneven Progress in 2015 and into 2016\nIn 2015, the unemployment rate fell significantly faster than we generally had\nanticipated in 2014. However, a series of unanticipated global developments beginning\nin the second half of 2014--including a prolonged decline in oil prices, a sizable\nappreciation of the dollar, and financial market turbulence emanating from abroad--ended\nup having adverse implications for the outlook for inflation and economic activity in the\nUnited States, prompting the FOMC to remove monetary policy accommodation at a\nslower pace than we had anticipated in mid-2014.\nU.S. gross domestic product (GDP) growth generally surprised to the downside in\n2015, reflecting, in part, weak economic activity abroad, the earlier appreciation of the\ndollar, and the effect of falling oil prices on business fixed investment. This\nunanticipated slowing in the pace of the economic recovery caused us to worry about the\nsustainability of ongoing improvements in employment and, thus, of likely progress\ntoward our maximum employment goal. Our worry was reinforced by our assessment\nthat, with the federal funds rate still near zero, there would likely be only limited scope\nfor us to respond by lowering short-term rates if the weakening in economic activity\nturned out to be persistent. In contrast, if the weakening proved transitory and the\n\n- 9 -\neconomy instead began to overheat, threatening to push inflation to an undesirably high\nlevel, the FOMC would have ample scope to respond through tighter monetary policy.\nInflation also was lower than expected, with headline PCE prices rising less than\n1 percent over the course of 2015, instead of around 1-3/4 percent as we had anticipated\nin June 2014. Much of this shortfall reflected the effects of falling oil prices and the\nappreciation of the dollar. My colleagues and I typically look through the effects on\ninflation of fluctuations in oil prices and the dollar because these effects tend to be\ntransitory. However, we became concerned in 2015 about the risk that part of the decline\nin inflation could prove to be longer lasting, especially given that inflation had already\nbeen running below our 2 percent objective for quite some time.10 These various\nconsiderations, along with our reassessment of longer-run economic conditions--which I\nwill discuss shortly--explain why the Committee ended up raising the target range for the\nfederal funds rate only 1/4 percentage point in 2015, substantially less than the full\npercentage point increase suggested by the median projection of FOMC participants\nreported in June 2014.\n2016 also brought some unexpected economic developments that led us to\nproceed cautiously. During the first half of the year, mixed readings on the job market,\nalong with additional disappointing data on real GDP growth, suggested again that\nprogress toward the achievement of our maximum employment goal could be slowing\nmarkedly. Meanwhile, inflation hovered just below 1 percent as dollar appreciation\ncontinued to exert downward pressure on import prices, and financial market turbulence\nemanating from abroad--associated with concerns about the Chinese economy and the\n10 These concerns were reinforced somewhat by a decline in market-based measures of inflation\ncompensation.\n\n- 10 -\nBrexit referendum--posed new risks to U.S. economic activity and inflation. Moreover,\neven as payroll gains turned solid again in the second half of 2016, the unemployment\nrate remained relatively flat, suggesting that perhaps there was more room for\nimprovement in the job market than we had previously thought. Those unanticipated\ndevelopments were part of the reason why the Committee again opted to proceed more\nslowly in removing accommodation than had been anticipated at the start of the year. We\nended up increasing the target range for the federal funds rate by only 1/4 percentage\npoint over the course of 2016, rather than the full percentage point suggested by our\nDecember 2015 projections.\nReassessing Longer-Run Conditions\nThe slower-than-anticipated increase in our federal funds rate target in 2015 and\n2016 reflected more than just the inflation, job market, and foreign developments I\nmentioned. During that period, the FOMC and most private forecasters generally\nlowered their assessments of the longer-run neutral level of the real federal funds rate.\nIndeed, at our October 2015 meeting, the FOMC had a comprehensive discussion of\nneutral real interest rates and was impressed by the breadth of evidence suggesting that\nthose rates had declined both here and abroad, and that the decline had been going on for\nsome time. In response to this growing evidence, the median assessment by FOMC\nparticipants of the longer-run level of the real federal funds rate fell from 1-3/4 percent in\nJune 2014 to 1-1/2 percent in December 2015 and then to 1 percent in December 2016.\nThese reassessments reflected, in part, the persistence of surprisingly sluggish\nproductivity growth--both in the United States and abroad--and suggested that fewer\n\n- 11 -\nfederal funds rate increases would be necessary than previously thought to scale back\naccommodation.\nPartly in response to persistently slow wage growth, FOMC participants and\nprivate forecasters have in recent years lowered their estimates of the normal longer-run\nrate of unemployment. The median projection of FOMC participants of the longer-run\nlevel of the unemployment rate fell from about 5-1/4 percent in June 2014 to\napproximately 4-3/4 percent in December 2016. Other things being equal, a lower\nlonger-run level of the unemployment rate suggests that the economy has greater scope to\ncreate jobs without generating too much inflation.11 Thus, the downward revisions to\nFOMC participants’ views on the unemployment rate over the longer run contributed to\nour assessment that monetary policy could stay accommodative longer than we had\nanticipated in 2014.\nFurther Progress since Mid-2016\nThe U.S. economy has exhibited remarkable resilience in the face of adverse\nshocks in recent years, and economic developments since mid-2016 have reinforced the\nCommittee’s confidence that the economy is on track to achieve our statutory goals. Job\ngains have remained quite solid, and the unemployment rate, at 4.8 percent in January, is\nnow in line with the median of FOMC participants’ estimates of its longer-run normal\nlevel. On the whole, the prospects for further moderate economic growth look\nencouraging, particularly as risks emanating from abroad appear to have receded\n11 The assessment that there was perhaps more room for improvement in the labor market than previously\nthought was reinforced by data showing that the labor force participation rate remained relatively stable in\n2016, rather than declining as many had expected.\n\n- 12 -\nsomewhat. The Committee currently assesses that the risks to the outlook are roughly\nbalanced.\nMoreover, after remaining disappointingly low through mid-2016, inflation\nmoved up during the second half of 2016, mainly because of the diminishing effects of\nthe earlier declines in energy prices and import prices. More recently, higher energy\nprices appear to have temporarily boosted inflation, with the total PCE price index rising\nnearly 2 percent in the 12 months ending in January. Core PCE inflation--which\nexcludes volatile energy and food prices and, therefore, tends to be a better indicator of\nfuture inflation--has been running near 1-3/4 percent. Market-based measures of inflation\ncompensation have moved up, on net, in recent months, although they remain low.\nWith the job market strengthening and inflation rising toward our target, the\nmedian assessment of FOMC participants as of last December was that a cumulative 3/4\npercentage point increase in the target range for the federal funds rate would likely be\nappropriate over the course of this year. In light of current economic conditions, such an\nincrease would be consistent with the Committee’s expectation that it will raise the target\nrange for the federal funds rate at a gradual pace and would bring the real federal funds\nrate close to some estimates of its current neutral level. However, partly because my\ncolleagues and I expect the neutral real federal funds rate to rise somewhat over the\nlonger run, we projected additional gradual rate hikes in 2018 and 2019.\nOur individual projections for the appropriate path for the federal funds rate\nreflect economic forecasts that generally envision that economic activity will expand at a\nmoderate pace in coming years, labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat\nfurther, and inflation will be at or near 2 percent over the medium term. In short, we\n\n- 13 -\ncurrently judge that it will be appropriate to gradually increase the federal funds rate if\nthe economic data continue to come in about as we expect. Indeed, at our meeting later\nthis month, the Committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are\ncontinuing to evolve in line with our expectations, in which case a further adjustment of\nthe federal funds rate would likely be appropriate.\nNonetheless, as we have said many times--and as my discussion today\ndemonstrates--monetary policy cannot be and is not on a preset course. As in 2015 and\n2016, the Committee stands ready to adjust its assessment of the appropriate path for\nmonetary policy if unanticipated developments materially change the economic outlook.\nMonetary Policy Is Not a Panacea\nThe U.S. economy has shown great improvement and is close to meeting our\ncongressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability, but we of\ncourse recognize that important challenges remain. For instance, as we noted in our latest\nMonetary Policy Report to the Congress, the ongoing expansion has been the slowest\nsince World War II, with real GDP growth averaging only about 2 percent per year.12\nThis subdued pace reflects, in part, slower growth in the labor force in recent years--\ncompared with much of the post-World War II period--and disappointing productivity\ngrowth both in the United States and abroad.\nOur report also noted that, despite a notable pickup in 2015, real incomes for the\nmedian family were still a bit lower than they were prior to the Great Recession, and the\ngains during this economic recovery have been skewed toward the top of the income\ndistribution, as has been the case for quite some time. Families at the 10th percentile of\n12 See Board of Governors (2017).\n\n- 14 -\nthe income distribution earned about 4 percent less in 2015 than they did in 2007,\nwhereas families at the 90th percentile earned about 4 percent more. In addition, the\neconomic circumstances of blacks and Hispanics, while improved since the depths of the\nrecession, remain worse, on average, that those of whites or Asians.\nThese unwelcome developments unfortunately reflect structural challenges that\nlie substantially beyond the reach of monetary policy. Monetary policy cannot, for\ninstance, generate technological breakthroughs or affect demographic factors that would\nboost real GDP growth over the longer run or address the root causes of income\ninequality. And monetary policy cannot improve the productivity of American workers.\nFiscal and regulatory policies--which are of course the responsibility of the\nAdministration and the Congress--are best suited to address such adverse structural\ntrends.\nConclusion\nTo conclude, we at the Federal Reserve must remain squarely focused on our\ncongressionally mandated goals. The economy has essentially met the employment\nportion of our mandate and inflation is moving closer to our 2 percent objective. This\noutcome suggests that our goal-focused, outlook-dependent approach to scaling back\naccommodation over the past couple of years has served the U.S. economy well.\nThis same approach will continue to drive our policy decisions in the months and\nyears ahead. With that in mind, our policy aims to support continued growth of the\nAmerican economy in pursuit of our congressionally mandated objectives. We do that,\nas I have noted, with an eye always on the risks. To that end, we realize that waiting too\nlong to scale back some of our support could potentially require us to raise rates rapidly\n\n- 15 -\nsometime down the road, which in turn could risk disrupting financial markets and\npushing the economy into recession. Having said that, I currently see no evidence that\nthe Federal Reserve has fallen behind the curve, and I therefore continue to have\nconfidence in our judgment that a gradual removal of accommodation is likely to be\nappropriate. However, as I have noted, unless unanticipated developments adversely\naffect the economic outlook, the process of scaling back accommodation likely will not\nbe as slow as it was during the past couple of years.\n\n- 16 -\nReferences\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2017).

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nConference on Economic Opportunity and Inequality\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nBoston, Massachusetts\nOctober 17, 2014\n\nThe distribution of income and wealth in the United States has been widening\nmore or less steadily for several decades, to a greater extent than in most advanced\ncountries.1 This trend paused during the Great Recession because of larger wealth losses\nfor those at the top of the distribution and because increased safety-net spending helped\noffset some income losses for those below the top. But widening inequality resumed in\nthe recovery, as the stock market rebounded, wage growth and the healing of the labor\nmarket have been slow, and the increase in home prices has not fully restored the housing\nwealth lost by the large majority of households for which it is their primary asset.\nThe extent of and continuing increase in inequality in the United States greatly\nconcern me. The past several decades have seen the most sustained rise in inequality\nsince the 19th century after more than 40 years of narrowing inequality following the\nGreat Depression. By some estimates, income and wealth inequality are near their\nhighest levels in the past hundred years, much higher than the average during that time\nspan and probably higher than for much of American history before then.2 It is no secret\nthat the past few decades of widening inequality can be summed up as significant income\nand wealth gains for those at the very top and stagnant living standards for the majority. I\nthink it is appropriate to ask whether this trend is compatible with values rooted in our\n1 See Salvatore Morelli, Timothy Smeeding, and Jeffrey Thompson (2014), “Post-1970 Trends in\nWithin-Country Inequality and Poverty: Rich and Middle Income Countries,” IRP Discussion Paper Series\n1419-14 (Madison, Wis.: Institute for Research on Poverty, March),\nwww.irp.wisc.edu/publications/dps/pdfs/dp141914.pdf.\n2 For income inequality in the past 100 years, see Anthony B.

Indeed, some variation in outcomes arguably contributes\nto economic growth because it creates incentives to work hard, get an education, save,\ninvest, and undertake risk. However, to the extent that opportunity itself is enhanced by\naccess to economic resources, inequality of outcomes can exacerbate inequality of\nopportunity, thereby perpetuating a trend of increasing inequality. Such a link is\nsuggested by the “Great Gatsby Curve,” the finding that, among advanced economies,\ngreater income inequality is associated with diminished intergenerational mobility.3 In\nsuch circumstances, society faces difficult questions of how best to fairly and justly\npromote equal opportunity. My purpose today is not to provide answers to these\ncontentious questions, but rather to provide a factual basis for further discussion. I am\npleased that this conference will focus on equality of economic opportunity and on ways\nto better promote it.\nIn my remarks, I will review trends in income and wealth inequality over the past\nseveral decades, then identify and discuss four sources of economic opportunity in\nAmerica--think of them as “building blocks” for the gains in income and wealth that most\nAmericans hope are within reach of those who strive for them. The first two are widely\nrecognized as important sources of opportunity: resources available for children and\n3\nSee Alan B. Krueger (2012), “The Rise and Consequences of Inequality in the United States,” speech\ndelivered at the Center for American Progress, Washington, January 12,\nwww.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/krueger_cap_speech_final_remarks.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\naffordable higher education. The second two may come as more of a surprise: business\nownership and inheritances. Like most sources of wealth, family ownership of\nbusinesses and inheritances are concentrated among households at the top of the\ndistribution. But both of these are less concentrated and more broadly distributed than\nother forms of wealth, and there is some basis for thinking that they may also play a role\nin providing economic opportunities to a considerable number of families below the top.\nIn focusing on these four building blocks, I do not mean to suggest that they\naccount for all economic opportunity, but I do believe they are all significant sources of\nopportunity for individuals and their families to improve their economic circumstances.\nIncome and Wealth Inequality in the Survey of Consumer Finances\nI will start with the basics about widening inequality, drawing heavily on a trove\nof data generated by the Federal Reserve’s triennial Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF),\nthe latest of which was conducted in 2013 and published last month.4 The SCF is broadly\nconsistent with other data that show widening wealth and income inequality over the past\nseveral decades, but I am employing the SCF because it offers the added advantage of\nspecific detail on income, wealth, and debt for each of 6,000 households surveyed.5 This\ndetail from family balance sheets provides a glimpse of the relative access to the four\nsources of opportunity I will discuss.\n4 Asset questions in the SCF are based on the value at the time of the survey. Since most interviews were\ncompleted between April and December 2013, some of the asset values do not reflect price increases\nexperienced in late 2013, and none reflect increases in 2014. Income questions in the SCF refer to the prior\ncalendar year, so the 2013 survey reports 2012 income. See Jesse Bricker, Lisa J. Dettling, Alice\nHenriques, Joanne W. Hsu, Kevin B. Moore, John Sabelhaus, Jeffrey Thompson, and Richard A. Windle\n(2014), “Changes in U.S. Family Finances from 2010 to 2013: Evidence from the Survey of Consumer\nFinances,” Federal Reserve Bulletin, vol. 100 (September), pp. 1-41,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2014/articles/scf/scf.htm.\n5 “Households” and “families” are used interchangeably in these remarks because the SCF uses both\ninterchangeably to describe its respondents.\n\n- 4 -\nWhile the recent trend of widening income and wealth inequality is clear, the\nimplications for a particular family partly depend on whether that family’s living\nstandards are rising or not as its relative position changes. There have been some times\nof relative prosperity when income has grown for most households but inequality\nwidened because the gains were proportionally larger for those at the top; widening\ninequality might not be as great a concern if living standards improve for most families.\nThat was the case for much of the 1990s, when real incomes were rising for most\nhouseholds. At other times, however, inequality has widened because income and wealth\ngrew for those at the top and stagnated or fell for others. And at still other times,\ninequality has widened when incomes were falling for most households, but the declines\ntoward the bottom were proportionally larger. Unfortunately, the past several decades of\nwidening inequality has often involved stagnant or falling living standards for many\nfamilies.\nSince the survey began in its current form in 1989, the SCF has shown a rise in\nthe concentration of income in the top few percent of households, as shown in figure 1.6\nBy definition, of course, the share of all income held by the rest, the vast majority of\nhouseholds, has fallen by the same amount.7 This concentration was the result of income\nand living standards rising much more quickly for those at the top. After adjusting for\n6 The share of income that went to the top 5 percent of households--a threshold of $230,000 in gross\nincome in 2013--rose from 31 percent of income reported by all respondents in 1989 to 37 percent in 2007.\nThe income share for this group fell in the financial crisis, to 34 percent in 2010, then rose in the recovery,\nregaining a 37 percent share in 2013.\n7 The top half of the distribution, except for the top 5 percent, earned 53 percent of all income in 1989 but\nonly 51 percent in 2010. In 2013, households in the “next 45 percent” had incomes between $47,000 and\n$230,000. While income has rebounded for the top 5 percent in the recovery, the share that went to the\nnext 45 percent declined further to 49 percent in 2013. The bottom half of the distribution saw their share\nof income fall from 16 percent in 1989 to 15 percent in 2007, edge up in 2010, and then reach a new low\nfor the survey last year at 14 percent.\n\n- 5 -\ninflation, the average income of the top 5 percent of households grew by 38 percent from\n1989 to 2013, as we can see in figure 2. By comparison, the average real income of the\nother 95 percent of households grew less than 10 percent. Income inequality narrowed\nslightly during the Great Recession, as income fell more for the top than for others, but\nresumed widening in the recovery, and by 2013 it had nearly returned to the pre-recession\npeak.8\nThe distribution of wealth is even more unequal than that of income, and the SCF\nshows that wealth inequality has increased more than income inequality since 1989. As\nshown in figure 3, the wealthiest 5 percent of American households held 54 percent of all\nwealth reported in the 1989 survey. Their share rose to 61 percent in 2010 and reached\n63 percent in 2013. By contrast, the rest of those in the top half of the wealth\ndistribution--families that in 2013 had a net worth between $81,000 and $1.9 million--\nheld 43 percent of wealth in 1989 and only 36 percent in 2013.\nThe lower half of households by wealth held just 3 percent of wealth in 1989 and\nonly 1 percent in 2013. To put that in perspective, figure 4 shows that the average net\nworth of the lower half of the distribution, representing 62 million households, was\n$11,000 in 2013.9 About one-fourth of these families reported zero wealth or negative\nnet worth, and a significant fraction of those said they were “underwater” on their home\nmortgages, owing more than the value of the home.10 This $11,000 average is 50 percent\n8 Largely because of losses in income from financial holdings, the share of total income received by the top\n5 percent of households fell 3 percentage points from 2007 to 2010, with the next 45 percent and lower half\nof households each gaining about half of that share. Some of the nominal income losses for households\nbelow the top 5 percent were offset by larger-than-normal transfer payments during the recession.\n9 All SCF income and wealth data prior to the 2013 survey are adjusted for inflation by expressing the\nvalues in 2013 dollars.\n10 In the 2013 SCF, 17 percent of all families reporting zero or negative net worth also reported they were\nunderwater on their home mortgages.\n\n- 6 -\nlower than the average wealth of the lower half of families in 1989, adjusted for inflation.\nAverage real wealth rose gradually for these families for most of those years, then\ndropped sharply after 2007. Figure 5 shows that average wealth also grew steadily for\nthe “next 45” percent of households before the crisis but didn’t fall nearly as much\nafterward. Those next 45 households saw their wealth, measured in 2013 dollars, grow\nfrom an average of $323,000 in 1989 to $516,000 in 2007 and then fall to $424,000 in\n2013, a net gain of about one-third over 24 years. Meanwhile, the average real wealth of\nfamilies in the top 5 percent has nearly doubled, on net--from $3.6 million in 1989 to\n$6.8 million in 2013.\nHousing wealth--the net equity held by households, consisting of the value of\ntheir homes minus their mortgage debt--is the most important source of wealth for all but\nthose at the very top.11 It accounted for three-fifths of wealth in 2013 for the lower half\nof families and two-fifths of wealth for the next 45. But housing wealth was only one-\nfifth of total wealth for the top 5 percent of families. The share of housing in total net\nworth for all three groups has not changed much since 1989.\nSince housing accounts for a larger share of wealth for those in the bottom half of\nthe wealth distribution, their overall wealth is affected more by changes in home prices.\nFurthermore, homeowners in the bottom half have been more highly leveraged on their\nhomes, amplifying this difference. As a result, while the SCF shows that all three groups\nsaw proportionally similar increases and subsequent declines in home prices from 1989 to\n2013, the effects on net worth were greater for those in the bottom half of households by\nwealth. Foreclosures and the dramatic fall in house prices affected many of these\n11 Housing wealth includes the net equity in primary residences and other residential real estate.\n\n- 7 -\nfamilies severely, pushing them well down the wealth distribution. Figure 6 shows that\nhomeowners in the bottom half of households by wealth reported 61 percent less home\nequity in 2013 than in 2007. The next 45 reported a 29 percent loss of housing wealth,\nand the top 5 lost 20 percent.\nFortunately, rebounding housing prices in 2013 and 2014 have restored a good\ndeal of the loss in housing wealth, with the largest gains for those toward the bottom.\nBased on rising home prices alone and not counting possible changes in mortgage debt or\nother factors, Federal Reserve staff estimate that between 2013 and mid-2014, average\nhome equity rose 49 percent for the lowest half of families by wealth that own homes.12\nThe estimated gains are somewhat less for those with greater wealth.13 Homeowners in\nthe bottom 50, which had an average overall net worth of $25,000 in 2013, would have\nseen their net worth increase to an average of $33,000 due solely to home price gains\nsince 2013, a 32 percent increase.\nAnother major source of wealth for many families is financial assets, including\nstocks, bonds, mutual funds, and private pensions.14 Figure 7 shows that the wealthiest\n5 percent of households held nearly two-thirds of all such assets in 2013, the next\n45 percent of families held about one-third, and the bottom half of households, just\n2 percent. This figure may look familiar, since the distribution of financial wealth has\n12 The house price data used are from CoreLogic, and data track price changes at the Core Based Statistical\nArea level between the survey month in 2013 and June 2014. The average increase in home prices over\nthis period was 8 percent. No adjustments are made to account for possible changes in mortgage leverage.\n13 Home price gains in 2013 and 2014 are estimated to have raised the home equity of home-owning\nhouseholds in the next 45 percent of households in the wealth distribution by 12 percent, and by 9 percent\nfor home-owning households in the top 5 percent of the wealth distribution.\n14 The SCF defines financial assets as liquid assets, certificates of deposit, directly held pooled investment\nfunds, stocks, bonds, quasi-liquid assets (including retirement accounts), savings bonds, whole life\ninsurance, other managed assets, and other financial assets.\n\n- 8 -\nconcentrated at the top since 1989 at rates similar to those for overall wealth, which we\nsaw in figure 3.15\nThose are the basics on wealth and income inequality from the SCF. Other\nresearch tells us that inequality tends to persist from one generation to the next. For\nexample, one study that divides households by income found that 4 in 10 children raised\nin families in the lowest-income fifth of households remain in that quintile as adults.16\nFewer than 1 in 10 children of families at the bottom later reach the top quintile. The\nstory is flipped for children raised in the highest-income households: When they grow\nup, 4 in 10 stay at the top and fewer than 1 in 10 fall to the bottom.\nResearch also indicates that economic mobility in the United States has not\nchanged much in the last several decades; that mobility is lower in the United States than\nin most other advanced countries; and, as I noted earlier, that economic mobility and\nincome inequality among advanced countries are negatively correlated.17\nFour Building Blocks of Opportunity\nAn important factor influencing intergenerational mobility and trends in\ninequality over time is economic opportunity. While we can measure overall mobility\n15 In 1989, the top 5 percent of households held 54 percent of financial assets, the next 45 percent (that is,\nhome-owning households in the 50th through 95th percentiles of the wealth distribution) held 42 percent,\nand the bottom half held 4 percent.\n16 See Pew Charitable Trusts (2012), Pursuing the American Dream: Economic Mobility across\nGenerations (Washington: PCT, July),\nwww.pewtrusts.org/~/media/legacy/uploadedfiles/pcs_assets/2012/PursuingAmericanDreampdf.pdf.\n17 See Raj Chetty, Nathaniel Hendren, Patrick Kline, Emmanuel Saez, and Nicholas Turner (2014), “Is the\nUnited States Still a Land of Opportunity?

The first of these cornerstones I would describe more fully as “resources\navailable to children in their most formative years.” The second is higher education that\nstudents and their families can afford.\nTwo additional sources of opportunity are evident in the SCF. They affect fewer\nfamilies than the two cornerstones I have just identified, but enough families and to a\nsufficient extent that I believe they are also important sources of economic opportunity.\nThe third building block of opportunity, as shown by the SCF, is ownership of a\nprivate business.18 This usually means ownership and sometimes direct management of a\nfamily business. The fourth source of opportunity is inherited wealth. As one would\nexpect, inheritances are concentrated among the wealthiest families, but the SCF\nindicates they may also play an important role in the opportunities available to others.\nResources Available for Children\nFor households with children, family resources can pay for things that research\nshows enhance future earnings and other economic outcomes--homes in safer\nneighborhoods with good schools, for example, better nutrition and health care, early\nchildhood education, intervention for learning disabilities, travel and other potentially\n18 Business assets in the SCF include both actively and “non-actively” managed businesses but do not\ninclude ownership of publicly traded stock.\n\n- 10 -\nenriching experiences.19 Affluent families have significant resources for things that give\nchildren economic advantages as adults, and the SCF data I have cited indicate that many\nother households have very little to spare for this purpose. These disparities extend to\nother household characteristics associated with better economic outcomes for offspring,\nsuch as homeownership rates, educational attainment of parents, and a stable family\nstructure.20\nAccording to the SCF, the gap in wealth between families with children at the\nbottom and the top of the distribution has been growing steadily over the past 24 years,\nbut that pace has accelerated recently. Figure 8 shows that the median wealth for families\nwith children in the lower half of the wealth distribution fell from $13,000 in 2007 to\n$8,000 in 2013, after adjusting for inflation, a loss of 40 percent.21 These wealth levels\nlook small alongside the much higher wealth of the next 45 percent of households with\nchildren. But these families also saw their median wealth fall dramatically--by one-third\n19 See, for example, Janet Currie and Douglas Almond (2011), “Human Capital Development before Age\nFive,” ch. 15 in David Card and Orley Ashenfelter, eds., Handbook of Labor Economics, vol. 4 (Holland:\nElsevier), pp. 1315-1486.\n20 Homeownership by parents is strongly associated with economic success for children; see Thomas P.\nBoehm and Alan M. Schlottmann (1999), “Does Home Ownership by Parents Have an Economic Impact\non Their Children?” Journal of Housing Economics, vol. 8 (September), pp. 217-32,\nwww.researchgate.net/publication/223016312_Does_Home_Ownership_by_Parents_Have_an_Economic_\nImpact_on_Their_Children. Ninety-seven percent of top-earning families with children own a home,\ncompared with fewer than half of the bottom 50 percent of families with children; educational attainment of\nparents is strongly predictive of outcomes for children that determine earnings. See Ayana Douglas-Hall\nand Michelle Chau (2007), “Parents’ Low Education Leads to Low Income, Despite Full-Time\nEmployment” (New York: National Center for Children in Poverty, Columbia University, November),\nwww.nccp.org/publications/pub_786.html. A considerable body of literature establishes the correlation\nbetween educational attainment of parents and their children. Other research has identified that this\nrelationship is causal; see, for example, Philip Oreopoulos, Marianne E. Page, and Ann Huff Stevens\n(2006), “The Intergenerational Effects of Compulsory Schooling,” Journal of Labor Economics, vol. 24\n(October), pp. 729-60. Eighty-six percent of top-earning households in the SCF with children are headed\nby a college graduate, compared with 12 percent in the bottom half of households with children; children\nraised by a single parent earn less as adults. See Mary Ann Powell and Toby L. Parcel (1997), “Effects of\nFamily Structure on the Earnings Attainment Process: Differences by Gender,” Journal of Marriage and\nFamily, vol. 59 (May), pp. 419-33. Only 4 percent of top-earning households with children are headed by\nunmarried parents, compared with 47 percent for the lower half of households with children.\n21 Distributional statistics for families with children are based on a sorting of only families with children.\n\n- 11 -\nin real terms--from $344,000 in 2007 to $229,000 in 2013. The top 5 percent of families\nwith children saw their median wealth fall only 9 percent, from $3.5 million in 2007 to\n$3.2 million in 2013, after inflation.\nFor families below the top, public funding plays an important role in providing\nresources to children that influence future levels of income and wealth. Such funding has\nthe potential to help equalize these resources and the opportunities they confer.\nSocial safety-net spending is an important form of public funding that helps offset\ndisparities in family resources for children. Spending for income security programs since\n1989 and until recently was fairly stable, ranging between 1.2 and 1.7 percent of gross\ndomestic product (GDP), with higher levels in this range related to recessions. However,\nsuch spending rose to 2.4 percent of GDP in 2009 and 3 percent in 2010.22 Researchers\nestimate that the increase in the poverty rate because of the recession would have been\nmuch larger without the effects of income security programs.23\nPublic funding of education is another way that governments can help offset the\nadvantages some households have in resources available for children. One of the most\nconsequential examples is early childhood education. Research shows that children from\nlower-income households who get good-quality pre-Kindergarten education are more\nlikely to graduate from high school and attend college as well as hold a job and have\nhigher earnings, and they are less likely to be incarcerated or receive public assistance.24\n22 Congressional Budget Office historic budget data.

Gains in enrollment have stalled since 2010, as has growth\nin funding, in both cases because of budget cuts related to the Great Recession. These\ncuts have reduced per-pupil spending in state-funded programs by 12 percent after\ninflation, and access to such programs, most of which are limited to lower-income\nfamilies, varies considerably from state to state and within states, since local funding is\noften important.25 In 2010, the United States ranked 28th out of 38 advanced countries in\nthe share of four-year-olds enrolled in public or private early childhood education.26\nSimilarly, the quality and the funding levels of public education at the primary\nand secondary levels vary widely, and this unevenness limits public education’s\nequalizing effect. The United States is one of the few advanced economies in which\npublic education spending is often lower for students in lower-income households than\nfor students in higher-income households.27 Some countries strive for more or less equal\nfunding, and others actually require higher funding in schools serving students from\n(1-2), pp. 114-28; and Clive R.

Half of U.S. public school funding comes from local property\ntaxes, a much higher share than in other advanced countries, and thus the inequalities in\nhousing wealth and income I have described enhance the ability of more-affluent school\ndistricts to spend more on public schools. Some states have acted to equalize spending to\nsome extent in recent years, but there is still significant variation among and within\nstates. Even after adjusting for regional differences in costs and student needs, there is\nwide variation in public school funding in the United States.28\nSpending is not the only determinant of outcomes in public education. Research\nshows that higher-quality teachers raise the educational attainment and the future\nearnings of students.29 Better-quality teachers can help equalize some of the\ndisadvantages in opportunity faced by students from lower-income households, but here,\ntoo, there are forces that work against raising teacher quality for these students. Research\nshows that, for a variety of reasons, including inequality in teacher pay, the best teachers\ntend to migrate to and concentrate in schools in higher-income areas.30 Even within\n28 See Education Week (2014), Quality Counts 2014: District Disruption and Revival (Bethesda, Md.:\nEditorial Projects in Education, January), www.edweek.org/ew/toc/2014/01/09/index.html.\n29 See Eric A.

The premium in lifetime earnings because of higher education\nhas increased over the past few decades, reflecting greater demand for college-educated\nworkers. By one measure, the median annual earnings of full-time workers with a four-\nyear bachelor’s degree are 79 percent higher than the median for those with only a high\nschool diploma.32 The wage premium for a graduate degree is significantly higher than\nthe premium for a college degree. Despite escalating costs for college, the net returns for\na degree are high enough that college still offers a considerable economic opportunity to\nmost people.33\nInstitute of Education Sciences, National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance),\nhttp://ies.ed.gov/ncee/pubs/20144001/pdf/20144001.pdf; and Kati Haycock and Eric A.

Even within\nschools, more experienced and higher performing teachers are more likely to teach Advanced Placement\nclasses which tend to serve more advantaged students. The result is that lower income and lower achieving\nstudents are more likely to be taught by less experienced and lower performing teachers.

College costs have risen much faster than income\nfor the large majority of households since 2001 and have become especially burdensome\nfor households in the bottom half of the earnings distribution.\nRising college costs, the greater numbers of students pursuing higher education,\nand the recent trends in income and wealth have led to a dramatic increase in student loan\ndebt. Outstanding student loan debt quadrupled from $260 billion in 2004 to $1.1 trillion\nthis year. Sorting families by wealth, the SCF shows that the relative burden of education\ndebt has long been higher for families with lower net worth, and that this disparity has\ngrown much wider in the past couple decades. Figure 10 shows that from 1995 to 2013,\noutstanding education debt grew from 26 percent of average yearly income for the lower\nhalf of households to 58 percent of income.34 The education debt burden was lower and\ngrew a little less sharply for the next 45 percent of families and was much lower and\ngrew not at all for the top 5 percent.35\nHigher education has been and remains a potent source of economic opportunity\nin America, but I fear the large and growing burden of paying for it may make it harder\nfor many young people to take advantage of the opportunity higher education offers.\nOpportunities to Build Wealth through Business Ownership\nFor many people, the opportunity to build a business has long been an important\npart of the American dream. In addition to housing and financial assets, the SCF shows\n15 percent. See Jaison R. Abel and Richard Deitz (2014), “Do the Benefits of College Still Outweigh the\nCosts?” Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Current Issues in Economics and Finance, vol. 20 (3),\nwww.newyorkfed.org/research/current_issues/ci20-3.pdf.\n34 Education debt in the SCF reflects the total amount of debt outstanding at the time of the survey.\n35 Education debt-to-income ratio is calculated based on what SCF respondents reported as their usual\nincome. Numbers are for families with education debt.\n\n- 16 -\nthat ownership of private businesses is a significant source of wealth and can be a vital\nsource of opportunity for many households to improve their economic circumstances and\nposition in the wealth distribution.\nWhile business wealth is highly concentrated at the top of the distribution, it also\nrepresents a significant component of wealth for some other households. 36 Figure 11\nshows that slightly more than half of the top 5 percent of households have a share in a\nprivate business. The average value of these holdings is nearly $4 million. Only\n14 percent of families in the next 45 have ownership in a private business, but for those\nthat do, this type of wealth constitutes a substantial portion of their assets--the average\namount of this business equity is nearly $200,000, representing more than one-third of\ntheir net worth. Only 3 percent of the bottom half of households hold equity in a private\nbusiness, but it is a big share of wealth for those few.37 The average amount of this\nwealth is close to $20,000, 60 percent of the average net worth for these households.38\nOwning a business is risky, and most new businesses close within a few years.\nBut research shows that business ownership is associated with higher levels of economic\nmobility.39 However, it appears that it has become harder to start and build businesses.\nThe pace of new business creation has gradually declined over the past couple of\n36 The SCF does not ask households whether they started businesses that closed, so reported business\nownership and wealth is largely related only to those businesses that succeed.\n37 Distributional statistics for business ownership and assets exclude outliers with large negative net worth.\n38 Business wealth took a big hit due to the recession and has only partly recovered for most families. For\nthe bottom half of the distribution, the $20,000 average in business wealth in 2013 was down from $29,000,\nafter adjusting for inflation, in 2007. The nearly $200,000 held by the next 45 percent with businesses was\ndown from $228,000 in 2007. The $4 million in business wealth of the top 5 percent in 2013 was down, in\nreal terms, from $4.4 million in 2007.\n39 See, for example, Robert Fairlie (2004), “Earnings Growth among Young Less-Educated Business\nOwners,” Industrial Relations, vol. 43 (July), pp. 634-59; Douglas Holtz-Eakin, Harvey S. Rosen, and\nRobert Weathers (2000), “Horatio Alger Meets the Mobility Tables,” Small Business Economics, vol. 14,\npp. 243-74; and Vincenzo Quadrini (2000), “Entrepreneurship, Saving, and Social Mobility,” Review of\nEconomic Dynamics, vol. 3 (January), pp. 1-40.\n\n- 17 -\ndecades, and the number of new firms declined sharply from 2006 through 2009.40 The\nlatest SCF shows that the percentage of the next 45 that own a business has fallen to a 25-\nyear low, and equity in those businesses, adjusted for inflation, is at its lowest point since\nthe mid-1990s. One reason to be concerned about the apparent decline in new business\nformation is that it may serve to depress the pace of productivity, real wage growth, and\nemployment.41 Another reason is that a slowdown in business formation may threaten\nwhat I believe likely has been a significant source of economic opportunity for many\nfamilies below the very top in income and wealth.\nInheritances\nAlong with other economic advantages, it is likely that large inheritances play a\nrole in the fairly limited intergenerational mobility that I described earlier.42 But\ninheritances are also common among households below the top of the wealth distribution\nand sizable enough that I believe they may well play a role in helping these families\neconomically.\nFigure 12 shows that half of the top 5 percent of households by wealth reported\nreceiving an inheritance at some time, but a considerable number of others did as well--\n40 See Business Dynamics Statistics, U.S. Census Bureau,\nwww.census.gov/ces/dataproducts/bds/data.html.

Inheritances\nare concentrated at the top of the wealth distribution but less so than total wealth. Just\nover half of the total value of inheritances went to the top 5 percent and 40 percent went\nto households in the next 45. Seven percent of inheritances were shared among\nhouseholds in the bottom 50 percent, a group that together held only 1 percent of all\nwealth in 2013.43\nThe average inheritance reported by those in the top 5 percent who had received\nthem was $1.1 million. That amount dwarfs the $183,000 average among the next\n45 percent and the $68,000 reported among the bottom half of households. But compared\nwith the typical wealth of these households, the additive effect of bequests of this size is\nsignificant for the millions of households below the top 5 that receive them.\nThe average age for receiving an inheritance is 40, when many parents are trying\nto save for and secure the opportunities of higher education for their children, move up to\na larger home or one in a better neighborhood, launch a business, switch careers, or\nperhaps relocate to seek more opportunity. Considering the overall picture of limited\nresources for most families that I have described today, I think the effects of inheritances\nfor the sizable minority below the top that receive one are likely a significant source of\neconomic opportunity.\nConclusion\nIn closing, let me say that, with these examples, I have only just touched the\nsurface of the important topic of economic opportunity, and I look forward to learning\n43 Reported inheritances can have been received at any point in the respondent’s life. As with other forms\nof wealth cited in these remarks, inheritances have been adjusted for inflation and are expressed in 2013\ndollars.\n\n- 19 -\nmore from the work presented at this conference. As I noted at the outset, research about\nthe causes and implications of inequality is ongoing, and I hope that this conference helps\nspur further study of economic opportunity and its effects on economic mobility. Using\nthe SCF and other sources, I have tried to offer some observations about how access to\nfour specific sources of opportunity may vary across households, but I cannot offer any\nconclusions about how much these factors influence income and wealth inequality. I do\nbelieve that these are important questions, and I hope that further research will help\nanswer them.\n\nPerspectives on Inequality and\nOpportunity from the Survey of\nConsumer Finances\nJanet L.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n3:00 p.m. EDT\nApril 16, 2013\nPanel Discussion on “Monetary Policy:\nMany Targets, Many Instruments. Where Do We Stand?”\nRemarks by\nJanet L. Yellen\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Rethinking Macro Policy II”\na conference sponsored by the International Monetary Fund\nWashington, D.C.\nApril 16, 2013\n\nThank you to the International Monetary Fund for allowing me to take part in\nwhat I expect will be a very lively discussion.1\nOnly five or six years ago, there wouldn’t have been a panel on the “many\ninstruments” and “many targets” of monetary policy. Before the financial crisis, the\nfocus was on one policy instrument: the short-term policy interest rate. While central\nbanks did not uniformly rely on a single policy target, many had adopted an “inflation\ntargeting” framework that, as the name implies, gives a certain preeminence to that one\nobjective. Of course, the Federal Reserve has long been a bit of an outlier in this regard,\nwith its explicit dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. Still, the\ndiscussion might not have gone much beyond “one instrument and two targets” if not for\nthe financial crisis and its aftermath, which have presented central banks with great\nchallenges and transformed how we look at this topic.\nLet me start with a few general observations to get the ball rolling. In terms of the\ntargets, or, more generally, the objectives of policy, I see continuity in the abiding\nimportance of a framework of flexible inflation targeting. By one authoritative account,\nabout 27 countries now operate full-fledged inflation-targeting regimes.2 The United\nStates is not on this list, but the Federal Reserve has embraced most of the key features of\nflexible inflation targeting: a commitment to promote low and stable inflation over a\nlonger-term horizon, a predictable monetary policy, and clear and transparent\ncommunication. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) struggled for years to\nformulate an inflation goal that would not seem to give preference to price stability over\n1 The views I express here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve\nSystem.\n2 See Gill Hammond (2012), State of the Art of Inflation Targeting, Centre for Central Banking Studies,\nCCBS Handbook No. 29 (London: Bank of England),\nwww.bankofengland.co.uk/education/Documents/ccbs/handbooks/pdf/ccbshb29.pdf.\n\n- 2 -\nmaximum employment. In January 2012, the Committee adopted a “Statement on\nLonger-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” which includes a 2 percent longer-run\ninflation goal along with numerical estimates of what the Committee views as the longer-\nrun normal rate of unemployment. The statement also makes clear that the FOMC will\ntake a “balanced approach” in seeking to mitigate deviations of inflation from 2 percent\nand employment from estimates of its maximum sustainable level. I see this language as\nentirely consistent with modern descriptions of flexible inflation targeting.\nFor the past four years, a major challenge for the Federal Reserve and many other\ncentral banks has been how to address persistently high unemployment when the policy\nrate is at or near the effective lower bound. This troubling situation has naturally and\nappropriately given rise to extensive discussion about alternative policy frameworks. I\nhave been very keen, however, to retain what I see as the key ingredient of a flexible\ninflation-targeting framework: clear communication about goals and how central banks\nintend to achieve them.\nWith respect to the Federal Reserve’s goals, price stability and maximum\nemployment are not only mandated by the Congress, but also easily understandable and\nwidely embraced. Well-anchored inflation expectations have proven to be an immense\nasset in conducting monetary policy. They’ve helped keep inflation low and stable while\nmonetary policy has been used to help promote a healthy economy. After the onset of the\nfinancial crisis, these stable expectations also helped the United States avoid excessive\ndisinflation or even deflation.\nOf course, many central banks have, in the wake of the crisis, found it challenging\nto provide appropriate monetary stimulus after their policy interest rate hit the effective\n\n- 3 -\nlower bound. This is the point where “many instruments” enters the discussion. The\nmain tools for the FOMC have been forward guidance on the future path of the federal\nfunds rate and large-scale asset purchases.\nThe objective of forward guidance is to affect expectations about how long the\nhighly accommodative stance of the policy interest rate will be maintained as conditions\nimprove. By lowering private-sector expectations of the future path of short-term rates,\nthis guidance can reduce longer-term interest rates and also raise asset prices, in turn,\nstimulating aggregate demand. Absent such forward guidance, the public might expect\nthe federal funds rate to follow a path suggested by past FOMC behavior in “normal\ntimes”--for example, the behavior captured by John Taylor’s famous Taylor rule. I am\npersuaded, however, by the arguments laid out by our panelist Michael Woodford and\nothers suggesting that the policy rate should, under present conditions, be held “lower for\nlonger” than conventional policy rules imply.\nI see these ideas reflected in the FOMC’s recent policy. Since September 2012,\nthe FOMC has stated that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain\nappropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens. Since\nDecember 2012, the Committee has said it intends to hold the federal funds rate near zero\nat least until unemployment has declined below 6-1/2 percent, provided that inflation\nbetween one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than 1/2 percentage point\nabove the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations\ncontinue to be well anchored. I believe that the clarity of this commitment to\naccommodation will itself support spending and employment and help to strengthen the\nrecovery.\n\n- 4 -\nAsset purchases have complemented our forward guidance, and the many\ndimensions of different purchase programs arguably constitute “many instruments.” In\ndesigning a purchase program, one must consider which assets to buy: Just Treasury\nsecurities or agency mortgage-backed securities as well? Which maturities? The Federal\nReserve, the Bank of England, and, more recently, the Bank of Japan have emphasized\nlonger-duration securities. At what pace should the securities be purchased? And how\nlong should they be held once purchases cease? Each of these factors may affect the\ndegree of accommodation delivered. Two innovations in the FOMC’s current asset\npurchase program, for example, are that it is open-ended rather than fixed in size like past\nprograms, and that the overall size of the program is explicitly linked to seeing a\nsubstantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.\nIn these brief remarks, I won’t thoroughly review the benefits or costs of our\nhighly accommodative policies, emphasizing only that I believe they have, on net,\nprovided meaningful support to the recovery. But I do want to spend a moment on one\npotential cost--financial stability--because this topic returns us to the theme of “many\ntargets” for central banks. As Chairman Bernanke has observed, in the years before the\ncrisis, financial stability became a “junior partner” in the monetary policy process, in\ncontrast with its traditionally larger role. The greater focus on financial stability is\nprobably the largest shift in central bank objectives wrought by the crisis.\nSome have asked whether the extraordinary accommodation being provided in\nresponse to the financial crisis may itself tend to generate new financial stability risks.\nThis is a very important question. To put it in context, let’s remember that the Federal\nReserve’s policies are intended to promote a return to prudent risk-taking, reflecting a\n\n- 5 -\nnormalization of credit markets that is essential to a healthy economy. Obviously,\nrisk-taking can go too far. Low interest rates may induce investors to take on too much\nleverage and reach too aggressively for yield. I don’t see pervasive evidence of rapid\ncredit growth, a marked buildup in leverage, or significant asset bubbles that would\nthreaten financial stability. But there are signs that some parties are reaching for yield,\nand the Federal Reserve continues to carefully monitor this situation.\nHowever, I think most central bankers view monetary policy as a blunt tool for\naddressing financial stability concerns and many probably share my own strong\npreference to rely on micro- and macroprudential supervision and regulation as the main\nline of defense. The Federal Reserve has been working with a number of federal\nagencies and international bodies since the crisis to implement a broad range of reforms\nto enhance our monitoring, mitigate systemic risk, and generally improve the resilience of\nthe financial system. Significant work will be needed to implement these reforms, and\nvulnerabilities still remain. Thus, we are prepared to use any of our many instruments as\nappropriate to address any stability concerns.\nLet me conclude by noting that I have touched on only some of the important\ndimensions of monetary policy targets and instruments that have arisen in recent years. I\nlook forward to a discussion that I expect will explore these issues and perhaps raise\nothers.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n12:25 p.m. EST\nDecember 2, 2015\nThe Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy\nRemarks by\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Economic Club of Washington\nWashington, D.C.\nDecember 2, 2015\n\nThank you to the Economic Club of Washington for inviting me to speak to you\ntoday. I would like to offer my assessment of the U.S. economy, nearly six and half\nyears after the beginning of the current economic expansion, and my view of the\neconomic outlook. I will describe the progress the economy has made toward the Federal\nOpen Market Committee’s (FOMC) goals of maximum employment and stable prices\nand what the current situation and the outlook imply for how monetary policy is likely to\nevolve to best foster the attainment of those objectives.\nThe Economic Outlook\nThe U.S. economy has recovered substantially since the Great Recession. The\nunemployment rate, which peaked at 10 percent in October 2009, declined to 5 percent in\nOctober of this year. At that level, the unemployment rate is near the median of FOMC\nparticipants’ most recent estimates of its longer-run normal level.1 The economy has\ncreated about 13 million jobs since the low point for employment in early 2010, and total\nnonfarm payrolls are now almost 4-1/2 million higher than just prior to the recession.\nMost recently, after a couple months of relatively modest payroll growth, employers\nadded an estimated 271,000 jobs in October. This increase brought the average monthly\ngain since June to about 195,000--close to the monthly pace of around 210,000 in the first\nhalf of the year and still sufficient to be consistent with continued improvement in the\nlabor market.\nDespite these substantial gains, we cannot yet, in my judgment, declare that the\nlabor market has reached full employment. Let me describe the basis for that view.\n1 See table 1 in the Summary of Economic Projections, an addendum to the minutes of the September 2015\nFOMC meeting. See Board of Governors (2015b).\n\n- 2 -\nTo begin with, I believe that a significant number of individuals now classified as\nout of the labor force would find and accept jobs in an even stronger labor market. To be\nclassified as unemployed, working-age people must report that they have actively sought\nwork within the past four weeks. Most of those not seeking work are appropriately not\ncounted as unemployed. These include most retirees, teenagers and young adults in\nschool, and those staying home to care for children and other dependent family members.\nEven in a stronger job market, it is likely that many of these individuals would choose not\nto work.\nBut some who are counted as out of the labor force might be induced to seek work\nif the likelihood of finding a job rose or if the expected pay was higher. Examples here\ninclude people who had become too discouraged to search for work when the prospects\nfor employment were poor and some who retired when their previous jobs ended. In\nOctober, almost 2 million individuals classified as outside the labor force because they\nhad not searched for work in the previous four weeks reported that they wanted and were\navailable for work. This is a considerable number of people, and some of them\nundoubtedly would be drawn back into the workforce as the labor market continued to\nstrengthen. Likewise, some of those who report they don’t want to work now could\nchange their minds in a stronger job market.\nAnother margin of labor market slack not reflected in the unemployment rate\nconsists of individuals who report that they are working part time but would prefer a full-\ntime job and cannot find one--those classified as “part time for economic reasons.” The\nshare of such workers jumped from 3 percent of total employment prior to the Great\nRecession to around 6-1/2 percent by 2010. Since then, however, the share of these part\n\n- 3 -\ntime workers has fallen considerably and now is less than 4 percent of those employed.\nWhile this decline represents considerable progress, particularly given secular trends that\nover time may have increased the prevalence of part-time employment, I think some\nroom remains for the hours of these workers to increase as the labor market improves\nfurther.\nThe pace of increases in labor compensation provides another possible indicator,\nalbeit an imperfect one, of the degree of labor market slack. Until recently labor\ncompensation had grown only modestly, at average annual rates of around 2 to 2-1/2\npercent. More recently, however, we have seen a welcome pickup in the growth rate of\naverage hourly earnings for all employees and of compensation per hour in the business\nsector. While it is too soon to conclude whether these more rapid rates of increase will\ncontinue, a sustained pickup would likely signal a diminution of labor market slack.\nTurning to overall economic activity, U.S. economic output--as measured by\ninflation-adjusted gross domestic product (GDP), or real GDP--has increased at a\nmoderate pace, on balance, during the expansion. Over the first three quarters of this\nyear, real GDP is currently estimated to have advanced at an annual rate of 2-1/4 percent,\nclose to its average pace over the previous five years. Many economic forecasters expect\ngrowth roughly along those same lines in the fourth quarter.\nGrowth this year has been held down by weak net exports, which have subtracted\nmore than 1/2 percentage point, on average, from the annual rate of real GDP growth\nover the past three quarters. Foreign economic growth has slowed, damping increases in\nU.S. exports, and the U.S. dollar has appreciated substantially since the middle of last\nyear, making our exports more expensive and imported goods cheaper.\n\n- 4 -\nBy contrast, total real private domestic final purchases (PDFP)--which includes\nhousehold spending, business fixed investment, and residential investment, and currently\nrepresents about 85 percent of aggregate spending--has increased at an annual rate of\n3 percent this year, significantly faster than real GDP. Household spending growth has\nbeen particularly solid in 2015, with purchases of new motor vehicles especially strong.\nJob growth has bolstered household income, and lower energy prices have left consumers\nwith more to spend on other goods and services. These same factors likely have\ncontributed to consumer confidence that is more upbeat this year than last year. Increases\nin home values and stock market prices in recent years, along with reductions in debt,\nhave pushed up the net worth of households, which also supports consumer spending.\nFinally, interest rates for borrowers remain low, due in part to the FOMC’s\naccommodative monetary policy, and these low rates appear to have been especially\nrelevant for consumers considering the purchase of durable goods.2\nOther components of PDFP, including residential and business investment, have\nalso advanced this year. The same factors supporting consumer spending have supported\nfurther gains in the housing sector. Indeed, gains in real residential investment spending\nhave been faster so far in 2015 than last year, although the level of new residential\nconstruction still remains fairly low. And outside of the drilling and mining sector, where\nlower oil prices have led to substantial cuts in outlays for new structures, business\ninvestment spending has posted moderate gains.\nOn balance, the moderate average pace of real GDP growth so far this year and\nover the entire expansion has been sufficient to help move the labor market closer to the\n2 For a recent empirical assessment, see Johnson, Pence, and Vine (2014).\n\n- 5 -\nFOMC’s goal of maximum employment. However, less progress has been made on the\nsecond leg of our dual mandate--price stability--as inflation continues to run below the\nFOMC’s longer-run objective of 2 percent. Overall consumer price inflation--as\nmeasured by the change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures--was\nonly 1/4 percent over the 12 months ending in October. However, this number largely\nreflects the sharp fall in crude oil prices since the summer of 2014 that, in turn, has\npushed down retail prices for gasoline and other consumer energy products. Because\nfood and energy prices are volatile, it is often helpful to look at inflation excluding those\ntwo categories--known as core inflation--which is typically a better indicator of future\noverall inflation than recent readings of headline inflation. But core inflation--which ran\nat 1-1/4 percent over the 12 months ending in October--is also well below our 2 percent\nobjective, partly reflecting the appreciation of the U.S. dollar. The stronger dollar has\npushed down the prices of imported goods, placing temporary downward pressure on\ncore inflation.3 The plunge in crude oil prices may also have had some small indirect\neffects in holding down the prices of non-energy items in core inflation, as producers\npassed on to their customers some of the reductions in their energy-related costs. Taking\naccount of these effects, which may be holding down core inflation by around 1/4 to\n1/2 percentage point, it appears that the underlying rate of inflation in the United States\nhas been running in the vicinity of 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent.\nLet me now turn to where I see the economy is likely headed over the next several\nyears. To summarize, I anticipate continued economic growth at a moderate pace that\nwill be sufficient to generate additional increases in employment, further reductions in\n3 For a more detailed discussion of the recent behavior of inflation, see Yellen (2015).\n\n- 6 -\nthe remaining margins of labor market slack, and a rise in inflation to our 2 percent\nobjective. I expect that the fundamental factors supporting domestic spending that I have\nenumerated today will continue to do so, while the drag from some of the factors that\nhave been weighing on economic growth should begin to lessen next year. Although the\neconomic outlook, as always, is uncertain, I currently see the risks to the outlook for\neconomic activity and the labor market as very close to balanced.\nTurning to the factors that have been holding down growth, as I already noted, the\nhigher foreign exchange value of the dollar, as well as weak growth in some foreign\neconomies, has restrained the demand for U.S. exports over the past year. In addition,\nlower crude oil prices have reduced activity in the domestic oil sector. I anticipate that\nthe drag on U.S. economic growth from these factors will diminish in the next couple of\nyears as the global economy improves and the adjustment to prior declines in oil prices is\ncompleted.\nAlthough developments in foreign economies still pose risks to U.S. economic\ngrowth that we are monitoring, these downside risks from abroad have lessened since late\nsummer. Among emerging market economies, recent data support the view that the\nslowdown in the Chinese economy, which has received considerable attention, will likely\ncontinue to be modest and gradual. China has taken actions to stimulate its economy this\nyear and could do more if necessary. A number of other emerging market economies\nhave eased monetary and fiscal policy this year, and economic activity in these\neconomies has improved of late. Accommodative monetary policy is also supporting\neconomic growth in the advanced economies. A pickup in demand in many advanced\n\n- 7 -\neconomies and a stabilization in commodity prices should, in turn, boost the growth\nprospects of emerging market economies.\nA final positive development for the outlook that I will mention relates to fiscal\npolicy. This year the effect of federal fiscal policy on real GDP growth has been roughly\nneutral, in contrast to earlier years in which the expiration of stimulus programs and\nfiscal policy actions to reduce the federal budget deficit created significant drags on\ngrowth.4 Also, the budget situation for many state and local governments has improved\nas the economic expansion has increased the revenues of these governments, allowing\nthem to increase their hiring and spending after a number of years of cuts in the wake of\nthe Great Recession. Looking ahead, I anticipate that total real government purchases of\ngoods and services should have a modest positive effect on economic growth over the\nnext few years.5\nRegarding U.S. inflation, I anticipate that the drag from the large declines in\nprices for crude oil and imports over the past year and a half will diminish next year.\nWith less downward pressure on inflation from these factors and some upward pressure\nfrom a further tightening in U.S. labor and product markets, I expect inflation to move up\nto the FOMC’s 2 percent objective over the next few years. Of course, inflation\nexpectations play an important role in the inflation process, and my forecast of a return to\nour 2 percent objective over the medium term relies on a judgment that longer-term\ninflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored. In this regard, recent measures\n4 The Congressional Budget Office estimates that current federal fiscal policies will have little effect on\neconomic growth this year, but that earlier fiscal policy actions reduced the rate of real GDP growth\nroughly 1-1/2 percentage points in 2013 and about 1/4 percentage point in 2014 relative to what it would\nhave been otherwise. See Congressional Budget Office (2015a).\n5 See Congressional Budget Office (2015b).\n\n- 8 -\nfrom the Survey of Professional Forecasters, the Blue Chip Economic Indicators, and the\nSurvey of Primary Dealers have continued to be generally stable. The measure of longer-\nterm inflation expectations from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, in\ncontrast, has lately edged below its typical range in recent years. However, this measure\noften seems to respond modestly, though temporarily, to large changes in actual inflation,\nand the very low readings on headline inflation over the past year may help explain some\nof the recent decline in the Michigan measure.6 Market-based measures of inflation\ncompensation have moved up some in recent weeks after declining to historically low\nlevels earlier in the fall. While the low level of these measures appears to reflect, at least\nin part, changes in risk and liquidity premiums, we will continue to monitor this\ndevelopment closely. Convincing evidence that longer-term inflation expectations have\nmoved lower would be a concern because declines in consumer and business expectations\nabout inflation could put downward pressure on actual inflation, making the attainment of\nour 2 percent inflation goal more difficult.\nMonetary Policy\nLet me now turn to the implications of the economic outlook for monetary policy.\nReflecting progress toward the Committee’s objectives, many FOMC participants\nindicated in September that they anticipated, in light of their economic forecasts at the\ntime, that it would be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by the\nend of this year. Some participants projected that it would be appropriate to wait until\nlater to raise the target funds rate range, but all agreed that the timing of a rate increase\n6 For example, the University of Michigan survey measure of longer-term inflation expectations was\ntemporarily elevated relative to its usual range in 2008 when crude oil and other commodity prices spiked\nand pushed up actual headline inflation for a time.\n\n- 9 -\nwould depend on what the incoming data tell us about the economic outlook and the\nassociated risks to that outlook.\nIn the policy statement issued after its October meeting, the FOMC reaffirmed its\njudgment that it would be appropriate to increase the target range for the federal funds\nrate when we had seen some further improvement in the labor market and were\nreasonably confident that inflation would move back to the Committee’s 2 percent\nobjective over the medium term. That initial rate increase would reflect the Committee’s\njudgment, based on a range of indicators, that the economy would continue to grow at a\npace sufficient to generate further labor market improvement and a return of inflation to\n2 percent, even after the reduction in policy accommodation. As I have already noted, I\ncurrently judge that U.S. economic growth is likely to be sufficient over the next year or\ntwo to result in further improvement in the labor market. Ongoing gains in the labor\nmarket, coupled with my judgment that longer-term inflation expectations remain\nreasonably well anchored, serve to bolster my confidence in a return of inflation to\n2 percent as the disinflationary effects of declines in energy and import prices wane.\nCommittee participants recognize that the future course of the economy is\nuncertain, and we take account of both the upside and downside risks around our\nprojections when judging the appropriate stance of monetary policy. In particular, recent\nmonetary policy decisions have reflected our recognition that, with the federal funds rate\nnear zero, we can respond more readily to upside surprises to inflation, economic growth,\nand employment than to downside shocks. This asymmetry suggests that it is appropriate\nto be more cautious in raising our target for the federal funds rate than would be the case\n\n- 10 -\nif short-term nominal interest rates were appreciably above zero.7 Reflecting these\nconcerns, we have maintained our current policy stance even as the labor market has\nimproved appreciably.\nHowever, we must also take into account the well-documented lags in the effects\nof monetary policy.8 Were the FOMC to delay the start of policy normalization for too\nlong, we would likely end up having to tighten policy relatively abruptly to keep the\neconomy from significantly overshooting both of our goals. Such an abrupt tightening\nwould risk disrupting financial markets and perhaps even inadvertently push the economy\ninto recession. Moreover, holding the federal funds rate at its current level for too long\ncould also encourage excessive risk-taking and thus undermine financial stability.\nOn balance, economic and financial information received since our October\nmeeting has been consistent with our expectations of continued improvement in the labor\nmarket. And, as I have noted, continuing improvement in the labor market helps\nstrengthen confidence that inflation will move back to our 2 percent objective over the\nmedium term. That said, between today and the next FOMC meeting, we will receive\nadditional data that bear on the economic outlook. These data include a range of\nindicators regarding the labor market, inflation, and economic activity. When my\ncolleagues and I meet, we will assess all of the available data and their implications for\nthe economic outlook in making our policy decision.\n7 See, for example, Adam and Billi (2007), Nakata (2012), and Evans and others (2015).\n8 Milton Friedman famously concluded that “monetary actions affect economic conditions only after a lag\nthat is both long and variable” (1961, p. 447). Evidence that monetary policy affects inflation with a lag\ncomes in part from vector autoregressions in which monetary policy shocks have been identified under a\nvariety of identification assumptions. See, for example, Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (2005) and\nUhlig (2005).\n\n- 11 -\nAs you know, there has been considerable focus on the first increase in the federal\nfunds rate after nearly seven years in which that rate has been at its effective lower\nbound. We have tried to be as clear as possible about the considerations that will affect\nthat decision. Of course, even after the initial increase in the federal funds rate, monetary\npolicy will remain accommodative. And it bears emphasizing that what matters for the\neconomic outlook are the public’s expectations concerning the path of the federal funds\nrate over time: It is those expectations that affect financial conditions and thereby\ninfluence spending and investment decisions. In this regard, the Committee anticipates\nthat even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic\nconditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels\nthe Committee views as normal in the longer run.\nThis expectation is consistent with an implicit assessment that the neutral nominal\nfederal funds rate--defined as the value of the federal funds rate that would be neither\nexpansionary nor contractionary if the economy were operating near its potential--is\ncurrently low by historical standards and is likely to rise only gradually over time. One\nindication that the neutral funds rate is unusually low is that U.S. economic growth has\nbeen quite modest in recent years despite the very low level of the federal funds rate and\nthe Federal Reserve’s very large holdings of longer-term securities. Had the neutral rate\nbeen running closer to the levels that are thought to have prevailed prior to the financial\ncrisis, current monetary policy settings would have been expected to foster a very rapid\neconomic expansion, with inflation likely rising significantly above our 2 percent\nobjective.\n\n- 12 -\nEmpirical support for the judgment that the neutral federal funds rate is low\ncomes from both academic research and Federal Reserve staff analysis. Figure 1\nemploys four macroeconomic models used by Federal Reserve staff to estimate the\n“natural” real rate of interest, a concept closely related to the neutral rate.9 The measures\nof the natural rate shown in this figure represent the real short-term interest rate that\nwould prevail in the absence of frictions that slow the adjustment of wages and prices to\nchanges in the economy; under a variety of assumptions, this interest rate has been shown\nto promote full employment.10 The shaded blue band represents the range of the\nestimates of the natural real rate at each point in time. This analysis suggests that the\nnatural real rate fell sharply with the onset of the crisis and has recovered only partially.\nThese findings are broadly consistent with those reported in a paper by Thomas Laubach\nand John Williams, shown in figure 2.11\n9 Note that these estimates are in real terms; to obtain estimates of the nominal natural interest rate, one\nwould add a measure of expected inflation. The four models used are (1) a dynamic stochastic general\nequilibrium (DSGE) model developed by the staff of the Federal Reserve Board and described in Kiley\n(2013); (2) a DSGE model developed by the staff of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and described\nin Del Negro and others (2013); (3) a DSGE model developed by the staff of the Federal Reserve Board\nbased on Christiano, Motto, and Rostagno (2014); and (4) a DSGE model developed by the staff of the\nFederal Reserve Board based on Guerrieri and Iacoviello (2013 [rev. 2014]).\n10 The concept of the natural rate goes back to Wicksell, who defined it as the rate that “tends neither to\nraise nor to lower” (1936 [1898], p. 102) commodity prices. Wicksell posited that the natural rate would be\nequal to the real interest rate that would balance supply and demand absent monetary frictions. The recent\nacademic literature draws on this notion to define the natural rate as the real interest rate that would prevail\nin the absence of sluggish adjustment in nominal prices and wages. In simple models, this interest rate\nwould result in stable prices and full employment; in some more complex models, this interest rate has\nbeen found to promote stable inflation and appropriate economic activity, although monetary policymakers\nface important tradeoffs in such settings. Importantly, the natural rate varies over time. For example, it\ngenerally rises with expected productivity growth and with “preference shocks” that capture households’\ndesire to consume today rather than save. For further discussion of the potential usefulness of the natural\nrate for monetary policy, see, for example, Barsky, Justiniano, and Melosi (2014) and Cúrdia and others\n(2015). By contrast, Laubach and Williams (2015) employ a statistical approach that defines the natural\nrate as one consistent with the economy operating at its full potential once transitory shocks to aggregate\nsupply and demand have abated. These two approaches to the measurement of the natural real rate are\ndifferent but have important similarities. Qualitatively, the two measures would be expected to move\ntogether in response to shocks to productivity growth and preferences so long as those shocks were very\npersistent.\n11 See Laubach and Williams (2015).\n\n- 13 -\nThe marked decline in the neutral federal funds rate after the crisis may be\npartially attributable to a range of persistent economic headwinds that have weighed on\naggregate demand. These headwinds have included tighter underwriting standards and\nlimited access to credit for some borrowers, deleveraging by many households to reduce\ndebt burdens, contractionary fiscal policy at all levels of government, weak growth\nabroad coupled with a significant appreciation of the dollar, slower productivity and labor\nforce growth, and elevated uncertainty about the economic outlook.12 As the restraint\nfrom these headwinds further abates, I anticipate that the neutral federal funds rate will\ngradually move higher over time. Indeed, in September, most FOMC participants\nprojected that, in the long run, the nominal federal funds rate would be near 3.5 percent,\nand that the actual federal funds rate would rise to that level fairly slowly.13\nBecause the value of the neutral federal funds rate is not directly measureable and\nmust be estimated based on our imperfect understanding of the economy and the\navailable data, I would stress that considerable uncertainty attends our estimates of its\ncurrent level and even more to its likely path going forward.14 That said, we will learn\n12 For analyses of how a sudden tightening in access to credit can lead to household deleveraging, pushing\ndown the neutral rate of interest, see Eggertsson and Krugman (2012) and Guerrieri and Lorenzoni (2015).\n13 See figure 2 in the Summary of Economic Projections, an addendum to the minutes of the September\n2015 FOMC meeting. See Board of Governors (2015b). The longer-run normal level of the federal funds\nrate reported in the SEP presumably matches participants’ assessment of the neutral nominal federal funds\nrate that will prevail in the longer run. Between June 2012 and September 2015 the median of FOMC\nparticipants’ estimates of the longer-run level of the federal funds rate declined 75 basis points, to 3.5\npercent. When revising down their estimates of the longer-run federal funds rate, participants have\ngenerally cited a lower assessment of the economy’s longer-run potential growth rate as a contributing\nfactor.\n14 One source of uncertainty regarding the neutral federal funds rate is so-called model uncertainty. As\nshown in figure 1, a variety of models that provide plausible descriptions of the economy give somewhat\ndifferent estimates of the neutral rate. A second source of uncertainty is the limited sample size of relevant\nmacroeconomic data: Our estimates of the neutral federal funds rate represent inferences about a moving\ntarget. As a result, although the data provide important signals about the neutral rate, our estimates are\nnecessarily imprecise. In Laubach and Williams (2003), for example, the standard error of the estimate of\nthe neutral rate in one baseline model was about 2 percentage points on average. Moreover, one-sided\n\n- 14 -\nmore from observing economic developments in the period ahead. It is thereby important\nto emphasize that the actual path of monetary policy will depend on how incoming data\naffect the evolution of the economic outlook. Stronger growth or a more rapid increase in\ninflation than we currently anticipate would suggest that the neutral federal funds rate is\nrising more quickly than expected, making it appropriate to raise the federal funds rate\nmore quickly as well; conversely, if the economy disappoints, the federal funds rate\nwould likely rise more slowly. Given the persistent shortfall in inflation from our\n2 percent objective, the Committee will, of course, carefully monitor actual progress\ntoward our inflation goal as we make decisions over time on the appropriate path for the\nfederal funds rate.\nIn closing, let me again thank the Economic Club of Washington for this\nopportunity to speak about the economy and monetary policy. The economy has come a\nlong way toward the FOMC’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.\nWhen the Committee begins to normalize the stance of policy, doing so will be a\ntestament, also, to how far our economy has come in recovering from the effects of the\nfinancial crisis and the Great Recession. In that sense, it is a day that I expect we all are\nlooking forward to.\nestimates of the neutral rate--those available to policymakers, based only on data known at the time--are\ngenerally noisier than estimates of the neutral rate at some previous time that incorporate all the data\navailable.\n\n- 15 -\nReferences\nAdam, Klaus, and Roberto M.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n11 a.m. EDT\nJuly 2, 2014\nMonetary Policy and Financial Stability\nRemarks by\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe 2014 Michel Camdessus Central Banking Lecture\nInternational Monetary Fund\nWashington, D.C.\nJuly 2, 2014\n\nIt is an honor to deliver the inaugural Michel Camdessus Central Banking\nLecture. Michel Camdessus served with distinction as governor of the Banque de France\nand was one of the longest-serving managing directors of the International Monetary\nFund (IMF). In these roles, he was well aware of the challenges central banks face in\ntheir pursuit of price stability and full employment, and of the interconnections between\nmacroeconomic stability and financial stability. Those interconnections were apparent in\nthe Latin American debt crisis, the Mexican peso crisis, and the East Asian financial\ncrisis, to which the IMF responded under Camdessus’s leadership. These episodes took\nplace in emerging market economies, but since then, the global financial crisis and, more\nrecently, the euro crisis have reminded us that no economy is immune from financial\ninstability and the adverse effects on employment, economic activity, and price stability\nthat financial crises cause.\nThe recent crises have appropriately increased the focus on financial stability at\ncentral banks around the world. At the Federal Reserve, we have devoted substantially\nincreased resources to monitoring financial stability and have refocused our regulatory\nand supervisory efforts to limit the buildup of systemic risk. There have also been calls,\nfrom some quarters, for a fundamental reconsideration of the goals and strategy of\nmonetary policy. Today I will focus on a key question spurred by this debate: How\nshould monetary and other policymakers balance macroprudential approaches and\nmonetary policy in the pursuit of financial stability?\nIn my remarks, I will argue that monetary policy faces significant limitations as a\ntool to promote financial stability: Its effects on financial vulnerabilities, such as\nexcessive leverage and maturity transformation, are not well understood and are less\n\n- 2 -\ndirect than a regulatory or supervisory approach; in addition, efforts to promote financial\nstability through adjustments in interest rates would increase the volatility of inflation and\nemployment. As a result, I believe a macroprudential approach to supervision and\nregulation needs to play the primary role. Such an approach should focus on “through the\ncycle” standards that increase the resilience of the financial system to adverse shocks and\non efforts to ensure that the regulatory umbrella will cover previously uncovered\nsystemically important institutions and activities. These efforts should be complemented\nby the use of countercyclical macroprudential tools, a few of which I will describe. But\nexperience with such tools remains limited, and we have much to learn to use these\nmeasures effectively.\nI am also mindful of the potential for low interest rates to heighten the incentives\nof financial market participants to reach for yield and take on risk, and of the limits of\nmacroprudential measures to address these and other financial stability concerns.\nAccordingly, there may be times when an adjustment in monetary policy may be\nappropriate to ameliorate emerging risks to financial stability. Because of this possibility,\nand because transparency enhances the effectiveness of monetary policy, it is crucial that\npolicymakers communicate their views clearly on the risks to financial stability and how\nsuch risks influence the appropriate monetary policy stance. I will conclude by briefly\nlaying out how financial stability concerns affect my current assessment of the\nappropriate stance of monetary policy.\nBalancing Financial Stability with Price Stability: Lessons from the Recent Past\nWhen considering the connections between financial stability, price stability, and\nfull employment, the discussion often focuses on the potential for conflicts among these\n\n- 3 -\nobjectives. Such situations are important, since it is only when conflicts arise that\npolicymakers need to weigh the tradeoffs among multiple objectives. But it is important\nto note that, in many ways, the pursuit of financial stability is complementary to the goals\nof price stability and full employment. A smoothly operating financial system promotes\nthe efficient allocation of saving and investment, facilitating economic growth and\nemployment. A strong labor market contributes to healthy household and business\nbalance sheets, thereby contributing to financial stability. And price stability contributes\nnot only to the efficient allocation of resources in the real economy, but also to reduced\nuncertainty and efficient pricing in financial markets, which in turn supports financial\nstability.\nDespite these complementarities, monetary policy has powerful effects on risk\ntaking. Indeed, the accommodative policy stance of recent years has supported the\nrecovery, in part, by providing increased incentives for households and businesses to take\non the risk of potentially productive investments. But such risk-taking can go too far,\nthereby contributing to fragility in the financial system.1 This possibility does not\nobviate the need for monetary policy to focus primarily on price stability and full\nemployment--the costs to society in terms of deviations from price stability and full\nemployment that would arise would likely be significant. I will highlight these potential\ncosts and the clear need for a macroprudential policy approach by looking back at the\nvulnerabilities in the U.S. economy before the crisis. I will also discuss how these\n1 The possibility that periods of relative economic stability may contribute to risk-taking and the buildup of\nimbalances that may unwind in a painful manner is often linked to the ideas of Hyman Minsky (see\nHyman P. Minsky (1992), “The Financial Instability Hypothesis,” Working Paper 74 (Annandale-on-\nHudson, N.Y.: Jerome Levy Economics Institute of Bard College, May),\nwww.levyinstitute.org/pubs/wp74.pdf). For a recent example of an economic model that tries to explore\nthese ideas, see, for example, Markus K. Brunnermeier and Yuliy Sannikov (2014), “A Macroeconomic\nModel with a Financial Sector,” American Economic Review, vol. 104 (February), pp. 379-421.\n\n- 4 -\nvulnerabilities might have been affected had the Federal Reserve tightened monetary\npolicy in the mid-2000s to promote financial stability.\nLooking Back at the Mid-2000s\nAlthough it was not recognized at the time, risks to financial stability within the\nUnited States escalated to a dangerous level in the mid-2000s. During that period,\npolicymakers--myself included--were aware that homes seemed overvalued by a number\nof sensible metrics and that home prices might decline, although there was disagreement\nabout how likely such a decline was and how large it might be. What was not\nappreciated was how serious the fallout from such a decline would be for the financial\nsector and the macroeconomy. Policymakers failed to anticipate that the reversal of the\nhouse price bubble would trigger the most significant financial crisis in the United States\nsince the Great Depression because that reversal interacted with critical vulnerabilities in\nthe financial system and in government regulation.\nIn the private sector, key vulnerabilities included high levels of leverage,\nexcessive dependence on unstable short-term funding, weak underwriting of loans,\ndeficiencies in risk measurement and risk management, and the use of exotic financial\ninstruments that redistributed risk in nontransparent ways.\nIn the public sector, vulnerabilities included gaps in the regulatory structure that\nallowed some systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) and markets to escape\ncomprehensive supervision, failures of supervisors to effectively use their existing\npowers, and insufficient attention to threats to the stability of the system as a whole.\nIt is not uncommon to hear it suggested that the crisis could have been prevented\nor significantly mitigated by substantially tighter monetary policy in the mid-2000s. At\n\n- 5 -\nthe very least, however, such an approach would have been insufficient to address the full\nrange of critical vulnerabilities I have just described. A tighter monetary policy would\nnot have closed the gaps in the regulatory structure that allowed some SIFIs and markets\nto escape comprehensive supervision; a tighter monetary policy would not have shifted\nsupervisory attention to a macroprudential perspective; and a tighter monetary policy\nwould not have increased the transparency of exotic financial instruments or ameliorated\ndeficiencies in risk measurement and risk management within the private sector.\nSome advocates of the view that a substantially tighter monetary policy may have\nhelped prevent the crisis might acknowledge these points, but they might also argue that a\ntighter monetary policy could have limited the rise in house prices, the use of leverage\nwithin the private sector, and the excessive reliance on short-term funding, and that each\nof these channels would have contained--or perhaps even prevented--the worst effects of\nthe crisis.\nA review of the empirical evidence suggests that the level of interest rates does\ninfluence house prices, leverage, and maturity transformation, but it is also clear that a\ntighter monetary policy would have been a very blunt tool: Substantially mitigating the\nemerging financial vulnerabilities through higher interest rates would have had sizable\nadverse effects in terms of higher unemployment. In particular, a range of studies\nconclude that tighter monetary policy during the mid-2000s might have contributed to a\nslower rate of house price appreciation. But the magnitude of this effect would likely\nhave been modest relative to the substantial momentum in these prices over the period;\nhence, a very significant tightening, with large increases in unemployment, would have\n\n- 6 -\nbeen necessary to halt the housing bubble.2 Such a slowing in the housing market might\nhave constrained the rise in household leverage, as mortgage debt growth would have\nbeen slower. But the job losses and higher interest payments associated with higher\ninterest rates would have directly weakened households’ ability to repay previous debts,\nsuggesting that a sizable tightening may have mitigated vulnerabilities in household\nbalance sheets only modestly.3\nSimilar mixed results would have been likely with regard to the effects of tighter\nmonetary policy on leverage and reliance on short-term financing within the financial\nsector. In particular, the evidence that low interest rates contribute to increased leverage\nand reliance on short-term funding points toward some ability of higher interest rates to\nlessen these vulnerabilities, but that evidence is typically consistent with a sizable range\n2 For a discussion of this issue encompassing experience across a broad range of advanced economies in the\n2000s, including the United States, see Jane Dokko, Brian M. Doyle, Michael T. Kiley, Jinill Kim, Shane\nSherlund, Jae Sim, and Skander Van Den Heuvel (2011), “Monetary Policy and the Global Housing\nBubble,” Economic Policy, vol. 26 (April), pp. 233-83. Igan and Loungani (2012) highlight how interest\nrates are an important, but far from the most important, determinant of housing cycles across countries (see\nDeniz Igan and Prakash Loungani (2012), “Global Housing Cycles,” IMF Working Paper Series\nWP/12/217 (Washington: International Monetary Fund, August),\nwww.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=26229.0). Bean and others (2010), examining the\ntradeoffs between unemployment, inflation, and stabilization of the housing market in the United Kingdom,\nimply that reliance on monetary policy to contain a housing boom may be too costly in terms of other\nmonetary policy goals (see Charles Bean, Matthias Paustian, Adrian Penalver, and Tim Taylor (2010),\n“Monetary Policy after the Fall,” paper presented at “Macroeconomic Challenges: The Decade Ahead,” a\nsymposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo.,\nAugust 26-28, www.kansascityfed.org/publicat/sympos/2010/2010-08-23-bean.pdf). Saiz (2014) suggests\nthat about 50 percent of the variation in house prices during the 2000s boom can be explained by low\ninterest rates, and finds that it was the remaining, “non-fundamental” component that subsequently\ncollapsed--that is, the interest rate component was not a primary factor in what Saiz terms “the bust” (see\nAlbert Saiz (2014), “Interest Rates and Fundamental Fluctuations in Home Values,” paper presented at the\nPublic Policy and Economics Spring 2014 Workshops, hosted by the Harris School of Public Policy,\nUniversity of Chicago, April 8,\nhttp://harrisschool.uchicago.edu/sites/default/files/SAIZ%20FUNDAMENTALS1_0.pdf).\n3 The notion that tighter monetary policy may have ambiguous effects on leverage or repayment capacity is\nillustrated in, for example, Anton Korinek and Alp Simsek (2014), “Liquidity Trap and Excessive\nLeverage,” NBER Working Paper Series 19970 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic\nResearch, March).\n\n- 7 -\nof quantitative effects or alternative views regarding the causal channels at work.4\nFurthermore, vulnerabilities from excessive leverage and reliance on short-term funding\nin the financial sector grew rapidly through the middle of 2007, well after monetary\npolicy had already tightened significantly relative to the accommodative policy stance of\n2003 and early 2004. In my assessment, macroprudential policies, such as regulatory\nlimits on leverage and short-term funding, as well as stronger underwriting standards,\nrepresent far more direct and likely more effective methods to address these\nvulnerabilities.5\nRecent International Experience\nTurning to recent experience outside the United States, a number of foreign\neconomies have seen rapidly rising real estate prices, which has raised financial stability\nconcerns despite, in some cases, high unemployment and shortfalls in inflation relative to\nthe central bank’s inflation target.6 These developments have prompted debate on how to\n4 See, for example, Tobias Adrian and Hyun Song Shin (2010), “Liquidity and Leverage,” Journal of\nFinancial Intermediation, vol. 19 (July), pp. 418-37; and Tobias Adrian and Hyun Song Shin (2011),\n“Financial Intermediaries and Monetary Economics,” in Benjamin Friedman and Michael Woodford, eds.,\nHandbook of Monetary Economics, vol. 3A (San Diego, Ca.: Elsevier), pp. 601-50. For a study\nemphasizing how changes in the response of monetary policy to financial vulnerabilities would likely\nchange the relationship between monetary policy and financial vulnerabilities, see Oliver de Groot (2014),\n“The Risk Channel of Monetary Policy,” International Journal of Central Banking, vol. 10 (June), pp. 115-\n60, www.ijcb.org/journal/ijcb14q2a6.pdf.\n5 This evidence and experience suggest that a reliance on monetary policy as a primary tool to address the\nbroad range of vulnerabilities that emerged in the mid-2000s would have had uncertain and limited effects\non risks to financial stability. Such uncertainty does not imply that a modestly tighter monetary policy may\nnot have been marginally helpful. For example, some research suggests that financial imbalances that\nbecame apparent in the mid-2000s may have signaled a tighter labor market and more inflationary pressure\nthan would have been perceived solely from labor market conditions and overall economic activity. Hence,\nsuch financial imbalances may have called for a modestly tighter monetary policy through the traditional\npolicy lens focused on inflationary pressure and economic slack. See, for example, David M. Arseneau and\nMichael Kiley (2014), “The Role of Financial Imbalances in Assessing the State of the Economy,” FEDS\nNotes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, April 18),\nwww.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/notes/feds-notes/2014/the-role-of-financial-imbalances-in-assessing-\nthe-state-of-the-economy-20140418.html.\n6 For a summary of house price developments across a range of countries through 2013, see International\nMonetary Fund (2014), “Global Housing Watch,” www.imf.org/external/research/housing/index.htm.\n\n- 8 -\nbest balance the use of monetary policy and macroprudential tools in promoting financial\nstability.\nFor example, Canada, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom have expressed a\nwillingness to use monetary policy to address financial stability concerns in unusual\ncircumstances, but they have similarly concluded that macroprudential policies should\nserve as the primary tool to pursue financial stability. In Canada, with inflation below\ntarget and output growth quite subdued, the Bank of Canada has kept the policy rate at or\nbelow 1 percent, but limits on mortgage lending were tightened in each of the years from\n2009 through 2012, including changes in loan-to-value and debt-to-income caps, among\nother measures.7 In contrast, in Norway and Sweden, monetary policy decisions have\nbeen influenced somewhat by financial stability concerns, but the steps taken have been\nlimited. In Norway, policymakers increased the policy interest rate in mid-2010 when\nthey were facing escalating household debt despite inflation below target and output\nbelow capacity, in part as a way of “guarding against the risk of future imbalances.”8\nSimilarly, Sweden’s Riksbank held its policy rate “slightly higher than we would have\ndone otherwise” because of financial stability concerns.9 In both cases, macroprudential\nactions were also either taken or under consideration.\n7 For a discussion of macroprudential steps taken in Canada, see Ivo Krznar and James Morsink (2014),\n“With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility: Macroprudential Tools at Work in Canada,” IMF\nWorking Paper Series 14/83 (Washington: International Monetary Fund, May),\nwww.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=41551.0.\n8 See Norges Bank (2010), “The Executive Board’s Monetary Policy Decision--Background and General\nAssessment,” press release, May 5, www.norges-bank.no/en/about/published/press-releases/2010/press-\nrelease-5-may-2010/the-executive-boards-monetary-policy-decision, paragraph 28.\n9 See Per Jansson (2013), “How Do We Stop the Trend in Household Debt?

Some proponents of a larger monetary policy response to\nfinancial stability concerns might argue that these perceived hurdles have been\noverblown and that financial stability concerns should be elevated significantly in\nmonetary policy discussions. A more balanced assessment, in my view, would be that\nincreased focus on financial stability risks is appropriate in monetary policy discussions,\nbut the potential cost, in terms of diminished macroeconomic performance, is likely to be\ntoo great to give financial stability risks a central role in monetary policy decisions, at\nleast most of the time.\nIf monetary policy is not to play a central role in addressing financial stability\nissues, this task must rely on macroprudential policies. In this regard, I would note that\nhere, too, policymakers abroad have made important strides, and not just those in the\nadvanced economies. Emerging market economies have in many ways been leaders in\napplying macroprudential policy tools, employing in recent years a variety of restrictions\non real estate lending or other activities that were perceived to create vulnerabilities.10\nAlthough it is probably too soon to draw clear conclusions, these experiences will help\ninform our understanding of these policies and their efficacy.\nPromoting Financial Stability through a Macroprudential Approach\nIf macroprudential tools are to play the primary role in the pursuit of financial\nstability, questions remain on which macroprudential tools are likely to be most effective,\n10 For a discussion, see Min Zhu (2014), “Era of Benign Neglect of House Price Booms Is Over,” IMF\nDirect (blog), June 11, http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/2014/06/11/era-of-benign-neglect-of-house-price-\nbooms-is-over.\n\n- 10 -\nwhat the limits of such tools may be, and when, because of such limits, it may be\nappropriate to adjust monetary policy to “get in the cracks” that persist in the\nmacroprudential framework.11\nIn weighing these questions, I find it helpful to distinguish between tools that\nprimarily build through-the-cycle resilience against adverse financial developments and\nthose primarily intended to lean against financial excesses.12\nBuilding Resilience\nTools that build resilience aim to make the financial system better able to\nwithstand unexpected adverse developments. For example, requirements to hold\nsufficient loss-absorbing capital make financial institutions more resilient in the face of\nunexpected losses. Such requirements take on a macroprudential dimension when they\nare most stringent for the largest, most systemically important firms, thereby minimizing\nthe risk that losses at such firms will reverberate through the financial system. Resilience\nagainst runs can be enhanced both by stronger capital positions and requirements for\nsufficient liquidity buffers among the most interconnected firms. An effective resolution\nregime for SIFIs can also enhance resilience by better protecting the financial system\nfrom contagion in the event of a SIFI collapse. Further, the stability of the financial\nsystem can be enhanced through measures that address interconnectedness between\nfinancial firms, such as margin and central clearing requirements for derivatives\ntransactions. Finally, a regulatory umbrella wide enough to cover previous gaps in the\n11 These questions have been explored in, for example, International Monetary Fund (2013), The\nInteraction of Monetary and Macroprudential Policies (Washington: IMF, January 29),\nwww.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2013/012913.pdf.\n12 The IMF recently discussed tools to build resilience and lean against excesses (and provided a broad\noverview of macroprudential tools and their interaction with other policies, including monetary policy); see\nInternational Monetary Fund (2013), Key Aspects of Macroprudential Policy (Washington: IMF, June 10),\nwww.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2013/061013b.pdf.\n\n- 11 -\nregulation and supervision of systemically important firms and markets can help prevent\nrisks from migrating to areas where they are difficult to detect or address.\nIn the United States, considerable progress has been made on each of these fronts.\nChanges in bank capital regulations, which will include a surcharge for systemically\nimportant institutions, have significantly increased requirements for loss-absorbing\ncapital at the largest banking firms. The Federal Reserve’s stress tests and\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review process require that large financial\ninstitutions maintain sufficient capital to weather severe shocks, and that they\ndemonstrate that their internal capital planning processes are effective, while providing\nperspective on the loss-absorbing capacity across a large swath of the financial system.\nThe Basel III framework also includes liquidity requirements designed to mitigate\nexcessive reliance by global banks on short-term wholesale funding.\nOversight of the U.S. shadow banking system also has been strengthened. The\nnew Financial Stability Oversight Council has designated some nonbank financial firms\nas systemically important institutions that are subject to consolidated supervision by the\nFederal Reserve. In addition, measures are being undertaken to address some of the\npotential sources of instability in short-term wholesale funding markets, including\nreforms to the triparty repo market and money market mutual funds--although progress in\nthese areas has, at times, been frustratingly slow.\nAdditional measures should be taken to address residual risks in the short-term\nwholesale funding markets. Some of these measures--such as requiring firms to hold\nlarger amounts of capital, stable funding, or highly liquid assets based on use of short-\nterm wholesale funding--would likely apply only to the largest, most complex\n\n- 12 -\norganizations. Other measures--such as minimum margin requirements for repurchase\nagreements and other securities financing transactions--could, at least in principle, apply\non a marketwide basis. To the extent that minimum margin requirements lead to more\nconservative margin levels during normal and exuberant times, they could help avoid\npotentially destabilizing procyclical margin increases in short-term wholesale funding\nmarkets during times of stress.\nLeaning Against the Wind\nAt this point, it should be clear that I think efforts to build resilience in the\nfinancial system are critical to minimizing the chance of financial instability and the\npotential damage from it. This focus on resilience differs from much of the public\ndiscussion, which often concerns whether some particular asset class is experiencing a\n“bubble” and whether policymakers should attempt to pop the bubble. Because a\nresilient financial system can withstand unexpected developments, identification of\nbubbles is less critical.\nNonetheless, some macroprudential tools can be adjusted in a manner that may\nfurther enhance resilience as risks emerge. In addition, macroprudential tools can, in\nsome cases, be targeted at areas of concern. For example, the new Basel III regulatory\ncapital framework includes a countercyclical capital buffer, which may help build\nadditional loss-absorbing capacity within the financial sector during periods of rapid\ncredit creation while also leaning against emerging excesses. The stress tests include a\nscenario design process in which the macroeconomic stresses in the scenario become\nmore severe during buoyant economic expansions and incorporate the possibility of\nhighlighting salient risk scenarios, both of which may contribute to increasing resilience\n\n- 13 -\nduring periods in which risks are rising.13 Similarly, minimum margin requirements for\nsecurities financing transactions could potentially vary on a countercyclical basis so that\nthey are higher in normal times than in times of stress.\nImplications for Monetary Policy, Now and in the Future\nIn light of the considerable efforts under way to implement a macroprudential\napproach to enhance financial stability and the increased focus of policymakers on\nmonitoring emerging financial stability risks, I see three key principles that should guide\nthe interaction of monetary policy and macroprudential policy in the United States.\nFirst, it is critical for regulators to complete their efforts at implementing a\nmacroprudential approach to enhance resilience within the financial system, which will\nminimize the likelihood that monetary policy will need to focus on financial stability\nissues rather than on price stability and full employment. Key steps along this path\ninclude completion of the transition to full implementation of Basel III, including new\nliquidity requirements; enhanced prudential standards for systemically important firms,\nincluding risk-based capital requirements, a leverage ratio, and tighter prudential buffers\nfor firms heavily reliant on short-term wholesale funding; expansion of the regulatory\numbrella to incorporate all systemically important firms; the institution of an effective,\ncross-border resolution regime for systemically important financial institutions; and\nconsideration of regulations, such as minimum margin requirements for securities\nfinancing transactions, to limit leverage in sectors beyond the banking sector and SIFIs.\n13\nSee the Policy Statement on the Scenario Design Framework for Stress Testing at Regulation YY--\nEnhanced Prudential Standards and Early Remediation Requirements for Covered Companies, 12 C.F.R.\npt. 252 (2013), Policy Statement on the Scenario Design Framework for Stress Testing,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/bcreg20131107a1.pdf.\n\n- 14 -\nSecond, policymakers must carefully monitor evolving risks to the financial\nsystem and be realistic about the ability of macroprudential tools to influence these\ndevelopments. The limitations of macroprudential policies reflect the potential for risks\nto emerge outside sectors subject to regulation, the potential for supervision and\nregulation to miss emerging risks, the uncertain efficacy of new macroprudential tools\nsuch as a countercyclical capital buffer, and the potential for such policy steps to be\ndelayed or to lack public support.14 Given such limitations, adjustments in monetary\npolicy may, at times, be needed to curb risks to financial stability.15\nThese first two principles will be more effective in helping to address financial\nstability risks when the public understands how monetary policymakers are weighing\nsuch risks in the setting of monetary policy. Because these issues are both new and\ncomplex, there is no simple rule that can prescribe, even in a general sense, how\nmonetary policy should adjust in response to shifts in the outlook for financial stability.\nAs a result, policymakers should clearly and consistently communicate their views on the\nstability of the financial system and how those views are influencing the stance of\nmonetary policy.\nTo that end, I will briefly lay out my current assessment of financial stability risks\nand their relevance, at this time, to the stance of monetary policy in the United States. In\nrecent years, accommodative monetary policy has contributed to low interest rates, a flat\n14 For a related discussion, see Elliott, Feldberg, and Lehnert, “The History of Cyclical Macroprudential\nPolicy in the United States.”\n15 Adam and Woodford (2013) present a model in which macroprudential policies are not present and\nhousing prices experience swings for reasons not driven by “fundamentals.” In this context, adjustments in\nmonetary policy in response to house price booms--even if such adjustments lead to undesirable inflation or\nemployment outcomes--are a component of optimal monetary policy. See Klaus Adam and Michael\nWoodford (2013), “Housing Prices and Robustly Optimal Monetary Policy,” working paper, June 29,\nhttp://adam.vwl.uni-mannheim.de/fileadmin/user_upload/adam/research/AW_AssetPrices.pdf.\n\n- 15 -\nyield curve, improved financial conditions more broadly, and a stronger labor market.\nThese effects have contributed to balance sheet repair among households, improved\nfinancial conditions among businesses, and hence a strengthening in the health of the\nfinancial sector. Moreover, the improvements in household and business balance sheets\nhave been accompanied by the increased safety of the financial sector associated with the\nmacroprudential efforts I have outlined. Overall, nonfinancial credit growth remains\nmoderate, while leverage in the financial system, on balance, is much reduced. Reliance\non short-term wholesale funding is also significantly lower than immediately before the\ncrisis, although important structural vulnerabilities remain in short-term funding markets.\nTaking all of these factors into consideration, I do not presently see a need for\nmonetary policy to deviate from a primary focus on attaining price stability and\nmaximum employment, in order to address financial stability concerns. That said, I do\nsee pockets of increased risk-taking across the financial system, and an acceleration or\nbroadening of these concerns could necessitate a more robust macroprudential approach.\nFor example, corporate bond spreads, as well as indicators of expected volatility in some\nasset markets, have fallen to low levels, suggesting that some investors may\nunderappreciate the potential for losses and volatility going forward. In addition, terms\nand conditions in the leveraged-loan market, which provides credit to lower-rated\ncompanies, have eased significantly, reportedly as a result of a “reach for yield” in the\nface of persistently low interest rates. The Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller\nof the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation issued guidance\nregarding leveraged lending practices in early 2013 and followed up on this guidance late\nlast year. To date, we do not see a systemic threat from leveraged lending, since broad\n\n- 16 -\nmeasures of credit outstanding do not suggest that nonfinancial borrowers, in the\naggregate, are taking on excessive debt and the improved capital and liquidity positions at\nlending institutions should ensure resilience against potential losses due to their\nexposures. But we are mindful of the possibility that credit provision could accelerate,\nborrower losses could rise unexpectedly sharply, and that leverage and liquidity in the\nfinancial system could deteriorate. It is therefore important that we monitor the degree to\nwhich the macroprudential steps we have taken have built sufficient resilience, and that\nwe consider the deployment of other tools, including adjustments to the stance of\nmonetary policy, as conditions change in potentially unexpected ways.\nConclusion\nIn closing, the policy approach to promoting financial stability has changed\ndramatically in the wake of the global financial crisis. We have made considerable\nprogress in implementing a macroprudential approach in the United States, and these\nchanges have also had a significant effect on our monetary policy discussions. An\nimportant contributor to the progress made in the United States has been the lessons we\nlearned from the experience gained by central banks and regulatory authorities all around\nthe world. The IMF plays an important role in this evolving process as a forum for\nrepresentatives from the world’s economies and as an institution charged with promoting\nfinancial and economic stability globally. I expect to both contribute to and learn from\nongoing discussions on these issues.",

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“The Elusive ‘Great’ Recovery:\nCauses and Implications for Future Business Cycle Dynamics”\n60th annual economic conference sponsored by the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nBoston, Massachusetts\nOctober 14, 2016\n\nExtreme economic events have often challenged existing views of how the\neconomy works and exposed shortcomings in the collective knowledge of economists.\nTo give two well-known examples, both the Great Depression and the stagflation of the\n1970s motivated new ways of thinking about economic phenomena. More recently, the\nfinancial crisis and its aftermath might well prove to be a similar sort of turning point.\nToday I would like to reflect on some ways in which the events of the past few years\nhave revealed limits in economists’ understanding of the economy and suggest several\nimportant questions I hope the profession will try to answer. Some of these questions are\nnot new, though recent events have made them more urgent. Appropriately, some are\naddressed by the papers prepared for this conference. Pursuing answers to these\nquestions is vital to the work of Federal Reserve and other economic policymakers, and\nthe Fed is likewise engaged in ongoing research to seek answers.\nThe Influence of Demand on Aggregate Supply\nThe first question I would like to pose concerns the distinction between aggregate\nsupply and aggregate demand: Are there circumstances in which changes in aggregate\ndemand can have an appreciable, persistent effect on aggregate supply?\nPrior to the Great Recession, most economists would probably have answered this\nquestion with a qualified “no.” They would have broadly agreed with Robert Solow that\neconomic output over the longer term is primarily driven by supply--the amount of output\nof goods and services the economy is capable of producing, given its labor and capital\nresources and existing technologies. Aggregate demand, in contrast, was seen as\nexplaining shorter-term fluctuations around the mostly exogenous supply-determined\n\n- 2 -\nlonger-run trend.1 This conclusion deserves to be reconsidered in light of the failure of\nthe level of economic activity to return to its pre-recession trend in most advanced\neconomies. This post-crisis experience suggests that changes in aggregate demand may\nhave an appreciable, persistent effect on aggregate supply--that is, on potential output.2\nThe idea that persistent shortfalls in aggregate demand could adversely affect the\nsupply side of the economy--an effect commonly referred to as hysteresis--is not new; for\nexample, the possibility was discussed back in the mid-1980s with regard to the\nperformance of European labor markets.3 But interest in the topic has increased in light\nof the persistent slowdown in economic growth seen in many developed economies since\nthe crisis. Several recent studies present cross-country evidence indicating that severe\nand persistent recessions have historically had these sorts of long-term effects, even for\ndownturns that appear to have resulted largely or entirely from a shock to aggregate\ndemand.4 With regard to the U.S. experience, one study estimates that the level of\npotential output is now 7 percent below what would have been expected based on its pre-\ncrisis trajectory, and it argues that much of this supply-side damage is attributable to\nseveral developments that likely occurred as a result of the deep recession and slow\nrecovery.5 In particular, the study finds that in the wake of the crisis, the United States\nexperienced a modest reduction in labor supply as a result of reduced immigration and a\nfall in labor force participation beyond what can be explained by cyclical conditions and\n1 See Solow (1997).\n2 Or, as Summers (2014) asked in a pithy inversion of Say’s law, is it true that “lack of demand creates lack\nof supply?” (p. 37).\n3 As Blanchard and Summers (1986) discuss, the question at the time was whether the long-run\nequilibrium, or “natural,” rate of unemployment in European economies had been permanently raised by\nprevious periods of high actual unemployment.\n4 For example, see Cerra and Saxena (2008); Howard, Martin, and Wilson (2011); Martin, Nunyan, and\nWilson (2014); and Blanchard, Cerutti, and Summers (2015).\n5 See Reifschneider, Wascher, and Wilcox (2015).\n\n- 3 -\ndemographic factors, as well as a marked slowdown in the estimated trend growth rate of\nlabor productivity. The latter likely reflects an unusually slow pace of business capital\naccumulation since the crisis and, more conjecturally, the sharp decline in spending on\nresearch and development and the very slow pace of new firm formation in recent years.6\nIf we assume that hysteresis is in fact present to some degree after deep\nrecessions, the natural next question is to ask whether it might be possible to reverse\nthese adverse supply-side effects by temporarily running a “high-pressure economy,”\nwith robust aggregate demand and a tight labor market. One can certainly identify\nplausible ways in which this might occur. Increased business sales would almost\ncertainly raise the productive capacity of the economy by encouraging additional capital\nspending, especially if accompanied by reduced uncertainty about future prospects. In\naddition, a tight labor market might draw in potential workers who would otherwise sit\non the sidelines and encourage job-to-job transitions that could also lead to more-\nefficient--and, hence, more-productive--job matches.7 Finally, albeit more speculatively,\nstrong demand could potentially yield significant productivity gains by, among other\nthings, prompting higher levels of research and development spending and increasing the\nincentives to start new, innovative businesses.\nHysteresis effects--and the possibility they might be reversed--could have\nimportant implications for the conduct of monetary and fiscal policy. For example,\nhysteresis would seem to make it even more important for policymakers to act quickly\n6 Fernald (2015), however, argues that much of the apparent slowdown in U.S. potential GDP growth\nbegan prior to the 2007-09 recession.\n7 See Okun (1973) for an early discussion of the benefits of a high-pressure economy. Importantly, not all\nof these benefits might show up as measured output, but they would nonetheless be welfare improving--for\nexample, higher job satisfaction from better matches between workers and employers, as noted by Akerlof,\nRose, and Yellen (1988).\n\n- 4 -\nand aggressively in response to a recession, because doing so would help to reduce the\ndepth and persistence of the downturn, thereby limiting the supply-side damage that\nmight otherwise ensue. In addition, if strong economic conditions can partially reverse\nsupply-side damage after it has occurred, then policymakers may want to aim at being\nmore accommodative during recoveries than would be called for under the traditional\nview that supply is largely independent of demand.\nMore research is needed, however, to better understand the influence of\nmovements in aggregate demand on aggregate supply.8 From a policy perspective, we of\ncourse need to bear in mind that an accommodative monetary stance, if maintained too\nlong, could have costs that exceed the benefits by increasing the risk of financial\ninstability or undermining price stability. More generally, the benefits and potential costs\nof pursuing such a strategy remain hard to quantify, and other policies might be better\nsuited to address damage to the supply side of the economy.\nHeterogeneity\nMy second question asks whether individual differences within broad groups of\nactors in the economy can influence aggregate economic outcomes--in particular, what\neffect does such heterogeneity have on aggregate demand?\nMany macroeconomists work with models where groups of individual actors,\nsuch as households or firms, are treated as a single “representative” agent whose behavior\nstands in for that of the group as a whole. For example, rather than explicitly modeling\n8 For example, the experience of the 1990s might seem to provide a natural case study of whether reverse\nhysteresis is possible. Unfortunately, most studies of the labor market during this period do not directly\nspeak to this issue, although Holzer, Raphael, and Stoll (2006) investigate changes in employers’\nwillingness to hire less-skilled workers during these years, while Katz and Krueger (1999) and my own\nstudy with Blinder (2001) explore the somewhat related question of how the U.S. economy was able to\nsimultaneously experience rapid growth, low unemployment, and low inflation in the late 1990s.\n\n- 5 -\nand then adding up the separate actions of a large number of different households, a\nmacro model might instead assume that the behavior of a single “average” household can\ndescribe the aggregate behavior of all households.\nPrior to the financial crisis, these so-called representative-agent models were the\ndominant paradigm for analyzing many macroeconomic questions. However, a\ndisaggregated approach seems needed to understand some key aspects of the Great\nRecession. To give one example, consider the effects of negative housing equity on\nconsumption. Although households typically reduce their spending in response to wealth\ndeclines, the many households whose equity positions in their homes were actually\ndriven negative by the reduction in house prices may have curtailed their spending even\nmore sharply because of a markedly reduced ability to borrow. Such a development, in\nturn, would shift the relationship between housing equity (which remained solidly\npositive in the aggregate) and consumer spending for the economy as a whole. Such a\nshift in an aggregate relationship would be difficult to understand or predict without\nusing disaggregated data and models.\nMore generally, studying the effects of household and firm heterogeneity might\nhelp us better account for the severity of the recession and the slow recovery. At the\nhousehold level, recent research finds that heterogeneity can amplify the effects of\nadverse shocks, a result that is largely driven by households with very little net worth that\nsharply increase their savings in a recession.9 At the firm level, there is evidence that\nfinancial constraints had a particularly large adverse effect on employment at small firms\nand the start-up of new firms, factors that may be part of the explanation for the Great\n9 See Krueger, Mitman, and Perri (2016).\n\n- 6 -\nRecession’s long duration and the subsequent slow recovery.10 More generally, if larger\nfirms seeking to expand have better access to credit than smaller ones, overall growth in\ninvestment and employment could depend in part on the distribution of sales across\ndifferent types of businesses. Modeling any of these issues quantitatively will likely\nrequire the use of a heterogeneous-agent framework.\nEconomists’ understanding of how changes in fiscal and monetary policy affect\nthe economy might also benefit from the recognition that households and firms are\nheterogeneous. For example, in simple textbook models of the monetary transmission\nmechanism, central banks operate largely through the effect of real interest rates on\nconsumption and investment. Once heterogeneity is taken into account, other important\nchannels emerge. For example, spending by many households and firms appears to be\nquite sensitive to changes in labor income, business sales, or the value of collateral that in\nturn affects their access to credit--conditions that monetary policy affects only indirectly.\nStudying monetary models with heterogeneous agents more closely could help us shed\nnew light on these aspects of the monetary transmission mechanism.\nWhile the economics profession has long been aware that these issues matter,\ntheir effects had been incorporated into macro models only to a very limited extent prior\nto the financial crisis.11 I am glad to now see a greater emphasis on the possible\nmacroeconomic consequences of heterogeneity, including in work by economists at the\n10 On the role of financing constraints for firm employment, see Siemer (2014); Chodorow-Reich (2014);\nand Duygan-Bump, Levkov, and Montoriol-Garriga (2015). A general-equilibrium model with\nheterogeneity among firms and credit frictions is studied in Khan and Thomas (2013). For the role of entry\nand exit in macroeconomic dynamics, see Clementi and Palazzo (2016) as well as Gourio, Messer, and\nSiemer (2016).\n11 For early quantitative work on the relationship between income and wealth heterogeneity and the\nmacroeconomy, see Krusell and Smith (1998).\n\n- 7 -\nFederal Reserve.12 Nevertheless, the various linkages between heterogeneity and\naggregate demand are not yet well understood, either empirically or theoretically. More\nbroadly, even though the tools of monetary policy are generally not well suited to achieve\ndistributional objectives, it is important for policymakers to understand and monitor the\neffects of macroeconomic developments on different groups within society.\nFinancial Linkages to the Real Economy\nMy third question concerns a key issue for monetary policy and macroeconomics\nthat is less directly addressed by this conference: How does the financial sector interact\nwith the broader economy?\nIn light of the housing bubble and subsequent events, policymakers clearly need\nto better understand what kinds of developments contribute to financial crises. What is\nthe relationship between the buildup of excessive leverage and the value of real estate and\nother types of collateral, and what factors impede or facilitate the deleveraging process\nthat follows? Does the economic fallout from a financial crisis depend on the particulars\nof the crisis, such as whether it involves widespread damage to household balance sheets?\nHow does the nature and degree of the interconnections between financial firms affect the\npropagation and amplification of stress through the financial system and overall\neconomy? Finally--and most importantly--what can monetary policy and financial\noversight do to reduce the frequency and severity of future crises?\n12 Guvenen (2011) reviews several issues related to macroeconomics with heterogeneity. For an overview\nof the interactions between distribution and aggregate outcomes, see the work by Quadrini and Rios-Rull\n(2015). For recent work on the effects of monetary policy in models with heterogeneous agents, see\nKaplan, Moll, and Violante (2016); Gornemann, Kuester, and Nakajima (2016); Auclert (2016); and Sterk\nand Tenreyro (2016).\n\n- 8 -\nAlthough the scope of these questions extends beyond the themes of this\nconference, it does include issues that are closely related. Consider the influence of\nbalance sheet conditions and noninterest credit terms on spending and overall activity--an\narea where it is important to take account of differences across individual households and\nfirms, as I just noted. Research on this topic has, of course, been ongoing for some time,\nand it has expanded greatly in the wake of the financial crisis.13 But I believe we have a\nlot more to learn about the ways in which changes in underwriting standards and other\ndeterminants of credit availability interact with interest rates to affect such things as\nconsumer spending, housing demand and home prices, business investment (especially\nfor small firms), and the formation of new firms.14 For example, is the persistent increase\nin the personal saving rate that we have observed since the collapse of the housing bubble\nprimarily a result of a sustained shift toward more prudent underwriting standards by\n13 For an example of early research on this topic, see Bernanke and Gertler (1989). Other important pre-\ncrisis studies include the development of the financial accelerator model by Bernanke and others (1999a)\nand work by Kashyap and Stein (2000) and Peek, Rosengren, and Tootell (2003) on the bank balance sheet\nchannel and the effects of bank loan supply shocks. For a more recent summary of the role of banks in the\nmonetary transmission mechanism, see Peek and Rosengren (2013). Chaney, Sraer, and Thesmer (2012)\nprovide evidence for the collateral channel of real estate for corporate investment, while Mian, Rao, and\nSufi (2013) examine the influence of household balance sheets on consumption.\n14 More empirical work would be useful to disentangle the spending effects that result from changes in\ncredit conditions from those that result from movements in interest rates, as estimates of the latter likely\noften inadvertently incorporate the former. Most empirical models of the overall economy do not explicitly\ncontrol for the influence of noninterest credit factors on consumption and investment; as a result, estimated\ninterest rate effects will partially reflect the influence of these factors to the extent these factors are\ncorrelated with interest rates. There are many reasons to suspect that this is the case. Movements in\ninterest rates influence a firm’s cash flow and the value of its collateral, all else being equal. Higher\ninterest rates also adversely affect consumer spending and especially residential investment, both by\nforcing households to devote a greater portion of their income to debt service and by making it more\ndifficult to qualify for a loan because of maximum payment-to-income rules. Evidence for these effects is\nprovided by Gertler and Karadi (2015), who show that relatively small changes in short-term interest rates\nare correlated with large movements in credit costs. Such correlations and interactions may explain why\nsome types of spending appear to be more correlated with movements in nominal interest rates than with\nreal interest rates; see Fair (2004, ch. 3) for evidence on this point. Finally, the relative contributions of\nrelaxed lending standards, low interest rates, and other factors to housing bubbles, both in the United States\nand abroad, remains an open and unsettled topic; Agnello and Shucknecht (2011) present cross-country\nevidence that monetary policy plays an important role, while Dokko and others (2011) argue that monetary\npolicy was a minor influence in the most recent episode.\n\n- 9 -\nlenders? Is it something that will ultimately prove transitory once households finish\nrepairing their balance sheets or become more confident about their future prospects for\nemployment and income?15 The answer to this latter question could have significant\nimplications for the longer-run normal, or neutral, level of interest rates and thus for the\nconduct of monetary policy.\nInflation Dynamics\nMy fourth question goes to the heart of monetary policy: What determines\ninflation?\nFrom my perspective, the standard framework for thinking about inflation\ndynamics used by central bank economists and others prior to the financial crisis remains\nconceptually useful today. A simple description of this framework might go something\nlike this:16 Inflation is characterized by an underlying trend that has been essentially\nconstant since the mid-1990s; previously, this trend seemed to drift over time, influenced\nby actual past inflation or other economic conditions. Theory and evidence suggest that\nthis trend is strongly influenced by inflation expectations that, in turn, depend on\nmonetary policy. In particular, the remarkable stability of various measures of expected\ninflation in recent years presumably represents the fruits of the Federal Reserve’s\nsustained efforts since the early 1980s to bring down and then stabilize inflation at a low\nlevel. The anchoring of inflation expectations that has resulted from this policy does not,\nhowever, prevent actual inflation from fluctuating from year to year in response to the\ntemporary influence of movements in energy prices and other disturbances. In addition,\n15 See Mian, Rao, and Sufi (2013) for an assessment of the role of leverage and housing wealth shocks in\ndriving consumption during the Great Recession. Work by Justiniano, Primiceri, and Tambalotti (2015)\nsuggests that debt overhang alone cannot explain the slow recovery from the Great Recession.\n16 See Yellen (2015) for a more extensive discussion.\n\n- 10 -\ninflation will tend to run above or below its underlying trend to the extent that resource\nutilization--which may serve as an indicator of firms’ marginal costs--is persistently high\nor low.17\nWhile this general framework for thinking about the inflation process remains\nuseful, questions about some of its quantitative features have arisen in the wake of the\nGreat Recession and the subsequent slow recovery. For example, the influence of labor\nmarket conditions on inflation in recent years seems to be weaker than had been\ncommonly thought prior to the financial crisis. Although inflation fell during the\nrecession, the decline was quite modest given how high unemployment rose; likewise,\nwages and prices rose comparatively little as the labor market gradually recovered.\nWhether this reduction in sensitivity was somehow caused by the recession or instead\npre-dated it and was merely revealed under extreme conditions is unclear.18 Either way,\nthe underlying cause is unknown. Does the reduced sensitivity reflect structural changes,\nsuch as globalization or a greater role for intangible capital in production that have\nreduced the importance of cyclical swings in domestic activity for firms’ marginal costs\nand pricing power? Or does it perhaps reflect the well-documented reluctance--or,\n17 In the economic literature, this general description of the inflation process is referred to as the\nexpectations-augmented Phillips curve. In its simplest form, the Phillips curve relates inflation to expected\ninflation and the intensity of resource utilization in the economy. In practice, however, empirical\nspecifications also typically include measures of supply shocks, such as changes in the relative prices of\nenergy or imported goods, as additional determinants. Two well-known variants of the Phillips curve are\nthe traditional “accelerationist” specification and the so-called New Keynesian Phillips curve; the former\napproximates inflation expectations using a moving average of past inflation, while the latter assumes that\ninflation expectations are “rational” and consistent with the predictions of a structural model of the entire\neconomy. Some adherents of either type of Phillips curve argue that their preferred model can explain the\nbehavior of inflation during and after the financial crisis. For example, Gordon (2013) presents evidence in\nfavor of an accelerationist model, while Del Negro, Giannoni, and Schorfheide (2015) make this claim for a\nNew Keynesian model.\n18 See Blanchard (2016) for evidence on how the responsiveness of inflation to resource utilization has\nchanged over time. Interestingly, research suggests that this sensitivity began declining well before the\ncrisis.\n\n- 11 -\nalternatively, limited ability--of firms to cut the nominal wages of their employees, which\ncould help to explain the relatively moderate movements in inflation we saw during and\nafter the recession?19\nAnother gap in our knowledge about the nature of the inflation process concerns\nexpectations. Although many theoretical models suggest that actual inflation should be\nmost closely related to short-run inflation expectations, as an empirical matter, measures\nof long-run expectations appear to explain the data better.20 Yet another unresolved issue\nconcerns whose expectations--those of consumers, firms, or investors--are most relevant\nfor wage and price setting, a point on which theory provides no clear-cut guidance. More\ngenerally, the precise manner in which expectations influence inflation deserves further\nstudy.21\nPerhaps most importantly, we need to know more about the manner in which\ninflation expectations are formed and how monetary policy influences them. Ultimately,\nboth actual and expected inflation are tied to the central bank’s inflation target, whether\nthat target is explicit or implicit.22 But how does this anchoring process occur? Does a\ncentral bank have to keep actual inflation near the target rate for many years before\ninflation expectations completely conform? Can policymakers instead materially\n19 For an early discussion of the potential macroeconomic effects of downward nominal wage rigidity, see\nAkerlof, Dickens, and Perry (1996). More recently, Daly and Hobijn (2014) develop a model in which the\nreluctance or inability of firms to cut nominal wages (or both) creates important nonlinearities in the\nrelationship between labor utilization and wage inflation. Finally, Fallick, Lettau, and Wascher (2015)\nreview the evidence for downward nominal wage rigidity in recent years and explore the ways in which it\nhas interacted with labor market stress over time.\n20 Specifically, survey measures of long-run inflation expectations are broadly correlated with estimates of\ninflation’s longer-term trend. See Clark and Davig (2008); see also Faust and Wright (2013, who make a\nrelated point in the context of inflation forecasting.\n21 As Mavroeidis, Plagborg-Moller, and Stock (2014) conclude from their exhaustive survey, empirical\nestimates of the New Keynesian inflation equation are “unable to pin down the role of expectations in the\ninflation process sufficiently accurately for the results to be useful for policy analysis” (p. 172).\n22 For a discussion of the theoretical and empirical influence of monetary policy on inflation in the context\nof a formal inflation-targeting regime, see Bernanke and others (1999b).\n\n- 12 -\ninfluence inflation expectations directly and quickly by simply announcing their intention\nto pursue a particular inflation goal in the future? Or does the truth lie somewhere in\nbetween, with a change in expectations requiring some combination of clear\ncommunications about policymakers’ inflation goal, concrete policy actions to\ndemonstrate their commitment to that goal, and at least some success in moving actual\ninflation toward its desired level in order to demonstrate the feasibility of the strategy?\nAlthough historical experience suggests that changing the public’s inflation expectations\nwould be neither quick nor easy, it is not clear which of these possibilities is correct.23\nWith nominal short-term interest rates at or close to their effective lower bound in\nmany countries, the broader question of how expectations are formed has taken on\nheightened importance. Under such circumstances, many central banks have sought\nadditional ways to stimulate their economies, including adopting policies that are directly\naimed at influencing expectations of future interest rates and inflation. The unusually\nexplicit and extended guidance about the likely future path of the federal funds rate that\nwas provided by the FOMC from 2011 through 2014 is an example of such a policy, as is\nthe Bank of Japan’s upward revision to its official inflation objective in 2013. Moreover,\nthese and other expectational strategies may be needed again in the future, given the\nlikelihood that the global economy may continue to experience historically low interest\nrates, thereby making it unlikely that reductions in short-term interest rates alone would\nbe an adequate response to a future recession.24\n23 See Kiley (2008) for a discussion of the relationship between U.S. monetary policy and survey measures\nof long-run inflation expectations; his results suggest that it took many years for the Federal Reserve to\nsucceed in anchoring long-run expectations at a low level. In a similar vein, Bernanke and others (1999b)\nconclude that inflation expectations “respond only after a lag following declines in [actual] inflation”\n(p. 298) based on their study of the effects of adopting inflation targeting in different countries.\n24 I discussed this likelihood in a recent speech (Yellen, 2016).\n\n- 13 -\nFor all of these reasons, I hope that researchers will strive to improve our\nunderstanding of inflation dynamics and its interactions with monetary policy.\nInternational Linkages\nBefore closing, let me mention one additional area where more study is needed--\nthe effects of changes in U.S. monetary policy on financial and economic conditions in\nthe rest of the world and the ways in which those foreign effects can feed back to\ninfluence conditions here at home. Of course, cross-country monetary policy spillovers\nhave been the subject of scholarly debate since the Great Depression, and much of the\nformal analysis of this topic dates back to the early 1960s.25 But this issue has received\nrenewed interest with the advent of unconventional monetary policies after the Great\nRecession and, more recently, the divergence of monetary policies among major\nadvanced-economy central banks.\nBroadly speaking, monetary policy actions in one country spill over to other\neconomies through three main channels: changes in exchange rates; changes in domestic\ndemand, which alter the economy’s imports; and changes in domestic financial\nconditions--such as interest rates and asset prices--that, through portfolio balance and\nother channels, affect financial conditions abroad. Research by Federal Reserve staff\nsuggests that, all told, U.S. monetary policy spillovers to other economies are positive--\nthat is, policies designed to provide stimulus to the U.S. economy also boost activity\nabroad, as negative effects of dollar depreciation are offset by positive effects of higher\nU.S. imports and easier foreign financial conditions.26 However, this issue is far from\n25 See Mundell (1963) and Fleming (1962).\n26 See Ammer, De Pooter, Erceg, and Kamin (2016). Other recent research on this topic includes Fukuda,\nKimura, Sudo, and Ugai (2013); Georgiadis (2015); Glick and Leduc (2015); and Ilzetski and Jin (2013).\n\n- 14 -\nsettled, as are a host of other related questions, including the following: Do U.S.\nmonetary policy actions affect advanced and emerging market countries differently? Do\nconventional and unconventional monetary policies spill over to other countries\ndifferently? And to what extent are U.S. interest rates and financial conditions influenced\nby easing measures abroad?\nConclusion\nIn closing, I would like to commend the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston for\norganizing this conference and fostering research and debate on questions vital to our\nunderstanding of the economy. Answering these questions will help the Federal\nReserve’s efforts to promote a healthy economy, and I am grateful for the opportunity to\nspeak to you today and be part of this important discussion.\n\n- 15 -\nReferences\nAgnello, Luca, and Ludger Schuknecht (2011). “Booms and Busts in Housing Markets:\nDeterminants and Implications,” Journal of Housing Economics, vol. 20\n(September), pp. 171-90.\nAkerlof, George A., William T.

The\ncriteria for designating these areas are available on the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council\n(FFIEC) website (www.ffiec.gov/cra). The designations continue to reflect local economic conditions,\nincluding triggers such as unemployment, poverty, and population changes.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau revised some census tract boundaries as a result of the 2010 Census. The\ncurrent list of distressed or underserved nonmetropolitan middle-income geographies does not reference\nthe 2011 designation. Geographies on the 2012 list will not necessarily have a corresponding 2011\ngeography. Therefore, users of the data are encouraged to refer to the list published in 2011 and to use\nthe one-year lag provision to determine if an activity is eligible for CRA consideration.\nSeveral of the data sets associated with the criteria for designating the distressed or underserved\ngeographies are no longer offered or were not available at the time of this press release. Comparable or\nexisting data were substituted in the calculations.1 In addition, the 2010 Census summary files for\nAmerican Samoa, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and U.S. Virgin Islands are\nnot yet available. This initial release of the 2012 list does not contain any tract information for those areas.\nThe 2012 list will be updated when information becomes available, which is expected in late 2012. The\n2011 lists should be used for those areas until the updated lists are released.\nAs with past releases, the agencies incorporate a one-year lag period for geographies that are no longer\ndesignated as distressed or underserved in the current release. Geographies subject to this one-year lag\nperiod are eligible to receive consideration for community development activities for 12 months after\npublication of the current list.\n1 These criteria are provided in Interagency Question and Answer § __.12(g)(4)(iii) – 1 (75 FR 11647-48 (Mar.\n11, 2010). A technical revision conforming the Interagency Question and Answer to this announcement will be\nreflected in the next publication of the Interagency Question and Answers Regarding Community Reinvestment\nin the Federal Register. The Domestic 5-year net migration provided by Census 2000 (PHC-T-22) Table 2 is\nnot available in the 2010 Census. Therefore, effective with the 2012 list, the following formula for 5-year loss in\npopulation will be used in its place: % 5 year population loss = (2010 population - 2005 population)/2005\npopulation. The threshold for 5-year population loss is a loss of 5 percent or more. All data are from the County\nIntercensal Estimates (2000-2010) at http://www.census.gov/popest/data/intercensal/county/county2010.html.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture has not yet released the new urban influence codes. Therefore the 2012\nlist will continue to use the 2003 codes at http://www.ers.usda.gov/Data/UrbanInfluenceCodes/ as the data\nsource for Low Density. As was the case previously, the 2012 list will use the urban influence codes 7, 10, 11\nor 12.\n\nThe current and previous years' lists can be found on the FFIEC website, along with information about the\ndata sources used to generate those lists.\nAdditional Information\nAll circulars and documents are available on the Internet through the Federal Reserve Bank of San\nFrancisco’s website, at http://www.frbsf.org/banking/letters.\nFor additional information, please contact:\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nBanking Supervision and Regulation\n(801) 322-7853",

    "text": "Speech to Town Hall – Los Angeles\nLos Angeles, California\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery October 9, 2007, 12:40 PM Pacific, 3:40 Eastern\nRecent Financial Developments and the U.S. Economic Outlook1\nGood afternoon. I’m honored by the invitation to speak to you today, and I’m\nespecially pleased to have the chance to visit Los Angeles, where, as you may know, our\nReserve Bank has a major branch. This is such an important metropolitan area, both for\nthe District and for the nation, that I particularly welcome the opportunity to exchange\nviews with you about local and national economic conditions, and I’m looking forward to\na lively question-and-answer session following my remarks.\nI would like to focus on recent developments in financial markets. I will discuss\ntheir impact on the prospects for the U.S. economy, and offer my perspective on the\npolicy actions that the Fed has taken to address them, including steps to improve liquidity\nin financial markets and also the decision of the Federal Open Market Committee, several\nweeks ago, to ease the stance of monetary policy by reducing the federal funds rate by 50\nbasis points. Before I continue, I want to emphasize that these remarks reflect my own\npersonal views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee.\nLet me begin with the financial markets and review some of the recent\ndevelopments I consider to be relevant in evaluating the prospects for the economy going\nforward. Beginning in mid-July, global financial markets became highly volatile and\nincreasingly averse to risk. In the U.S., perhaps the most dramatic illustration of the\n1 I would like to thank San Francisco Fed staff members John Judd and Judith Goff for excellent assistance\nin the preparation of these remarks.\n1\n\nensuing flight to safety was the decline in the three-month Treasury bill rate, which\ndipped by almost 2 percentage points between mid-July and August 20th.\nDramatically wider yield spreads on credit default swaps, which provide\ninsurance against default on the underlying securities, are further evidence of increased\nrisk aversion in financial markets. Indeed, wider spreads became evident for a host of\nunderlying instruments, from mortgages to corporate bonds, with lower-rated instruments\nseeing especially big increases in spreads. At the same time, options-based implied\nvolatilities on a range of assets, from equities to foreign exchange, increased markedly,\nreflecting heightened uncertainty about the future. Treasury bill rates partially rebounded\nfrom their lows in August, and credit default spreads abated somewhat, but risk aversion\nremains notably high. This same turbulence has hit markets abroad, where risk spreads\nand implied volatilities are up, and there has been a significant flight to safety.\nBorrowing costs facing households and firms directly influence their spending\ndecisions and aggregate demand and, for this reason, they are of particular relevance to\nmonetary policy. On the corporate side, prime borrowers have experienced little net\nchange in their borrowing costs because higher spreads have been offset by lower\nTreasury rates, which, have been influenced both by the flight to safety and, of course, by\nactual and expected Fed action to cut the funds rate. Issuers of low-grade corporate bonds\nwith greater credit risk, in contrast, face moderately higher borrowing costs.\nThe mortgage market has been the epicenter of the financial shock, and, not\nsurprisingly, greater aversion to risk has been particularly apparent there, with spreads\nabove Treasuries increasing for mortgages of all types. Although borrowing rates for\nlow-risk conforming mortgages have actually decreased, other mortgage rates have risen,\n2\n\nincluding those available to some borrowers with high credit ratings. In particular, rates\non jumbo mortgages, both fixed- and adjustable-rate, have risen since mid-July.\nSubprime mortgages—which have been a major trouble spot—have become\ndifficult to get at any rate. And that reflects another sign of the increased caution of\nmarket participants, specifically, more restricted credit terms and availability. In the\nmortgage market, lenders have tightened credit standards, making nonprime and jumbo\nmortgages available to fewer borrowers. For example, mortgage lenders report raising\nFICO scores and lowering allowable loan-to-value ratios in many mortgage loan\nprograms, and many subprime programs have been shut down altogether.\nMoreover, some markets have been experiencing illiquidity; in other words, the\nmarkets themselves are not functioning efficiently, or may not be functioning much at all.\nI am referring particularly to the markets for securitized assets, such as mortgage-backed\nsecurities, and that for asset-backed commercial paper. This illiquidity has become an\nenormous problem for companies that specialize in originating mortgages and then\nbundling them to sell as securities. The markets for selling these securities have all but\ndried up, except for the lowest-risk, “conforming” agency mortgages that can be sold to\nFreddie Mac and Fannie Mae. The asset-backed commercial paper market is where many\nfirms, including financial institutions, get short-term funding. With liquidity problems in\nthe markets in which many mortgage companies both sell assets and borrow, these firms\nhave faced serious challenges, and a few have gone out of business.\nDepository institutions also have faced some illiquidity, specifically in term\ninterbank funding markets—those for maturities in the one- to six-month range—as\nbanks sought to conserve their liquidity. A concern that has added to the illiquidity of\n3\n\nthese markets is that mortgages and other assets that are normally securitized may come\nback onto banks’ balance sheets and that customers may draw on unsecured credit lines.\nAlthough liquidity in these markets has improved since mid-September, they remain\nimpaired.\nMany of the liquidity problems afflicting banks and other financial market\nparticipants are gradually being resolved, but it’s not clear that all markets will return to\n“business as usual,” as defined by conditions in the first half of this year, even after that\noccurs. For one thing, many of the structured credit products that became so widely used\nmay prove to be too complex to be viable going forward, and this would more or less\npermanently reduce the quantity of credit available to some risky borrowers. Moreover,\nas I mentioned, if financial intermediation that was routinely conducted via asset\nsecuritization and off-balance sheet financing vehicles ultimately migrates back onto the\nbooks of the banks, borrowing spreads and lending terms are likely to remain tighter\ngiven current limitations on bank capital and the higher costs of conducting\nintermediation through the banking sector. Most importantly, the recent widening of\nspreads appears to reflect a return to more realistic pricing of risk throughout the\neconomy. This development may be positive for the long run, but it will be\ncontractionary in the short run.\nTo assess how financial conditions relevant to aggregate demand have changed,\nwe must consider not only credit markets but also the markets for equity and foreign\nexchange. These markets have hardly been immune to recent financial turbulence, but the\nchanges since mid-July are, on balance, less dramatic. Broad equity indices have been\n4\n\nvery volatile, but, on the whole, they are little changed since mid-July. As for the dollar,\nit has declined on a trade-weighted basis, but only moderately.\nThe Fed has three main responsibilities that pertain to these developments:\npromoting financial stability to help financial markets function in an orderly way,\nsupervising and regulating banks and bank holding companies to ensure the safety and\nsoundness of the banking system, and conducting monetary policy to achieve its\ncongressionally mandated goals of price stability and maximum sustainable output and\nemployment.\nWith regard to its responsibilities for financial market stability, the Fed took a\nnumber of steps to help restore liquidity in the financial markets. One step in the second\nweek of August involved a sizable injection of reserves to prevent the federal funds rate\nfrom rising above its 5¼ percent target in the face of huge demands for short-term, liquid\nfunds. In addition, on August 17 the Fed announced a cut in the discount rate of 50 basis\npoints, which narrowed the spread with the target federal funds rate. The announcement\nalso indicated that term loans would be made available for periods up to 30 days,\nrenewable by the borrower. Furthermore, the Fed made clear that asset-backed\ncommercial paper, which had become highly illiquid, is acceptable as collateral for\ndiscount window borrowing. These efforts to encourage the use of the discount window\nwere designed to promote the restoration of orderly conditions in financial markets by\nproviding depositories with greater assurance about the cost and availability of funding.\nWhile helpful, these actions have not, however, served as a panacea.\nIn its role as a supervisor and regulator of banks, the Fed has long focused on\ninsuring that banks hold adequate capital and that they carefully monitor and manage\n5\n\nrisks. As a consequence, the strong capital positions of banks should be helpful to them in\nweathering the financial turmoil. The Fed is carefully monitoring the impact of recent\nfinancial developments on the banking system and on core institutions involved in the\npayments system. Importantly, the Fed’s supervisory role has facilitated the collection of\ntimely and reliable information on developments in banking and capital markets, and the\ninsights gained through this process have been critical in shaping the Fed’s response in\nrecent weeks.\nFor the conduct of monetary policy, the main question is how financial\ndevelopments and other economic factors are likely to affect the outlook for the U.S.\neconomy and the risks to that outlook. The reason this is the main question is that\nmonetary policy’s unswerving focus should be on pursuing the Fed’s congressionally\nmandated goals of price stability and full employment.\nThis brings me to the issue of “moral hazard,” a topic that has been much\ndiscussed since the recent financial turbulence began. A concern that is frequently\nexpressed is that an easing of the stance of monetary policy could end up shielding\ninvestors who misjudged fundamentals or incorrectly assessed risks from losses and\nthereby lead them to take inappropriate risks in the future because they think the Fed will\nact to cushion the consequences of their decisions. I have two responses to this concern.\nFirst, the Fed’s policy response will not prevent a repricing of risk from occurring and\ninvestors who misjudged risks will surely suffer losses even if monetary policy is\nsuccessful in keeping the economy on track. Second, I don’t believe that the Fed should\nstand aside as a financial shock threatens to derail the economy, because that would run\nthe risk of many innocent people being hurt by the loss of jobs and economic well-being.\n6\n\nSo I believe that, in conducting monetary policy, the Fed should retain a clear focus on\nhow financial market developments are likely to affect employment, output, and inflation\nand not be concerned with who wins and who loses in financial markets.\nWith those principles in mind, let me briefly review recent economic\ndevelopments. The U.S. economy turned in a fairly good performance in the first half of\nthe year. Growth in the first quarter was weak, but it picked up to a robust pace in the\nsecond quarter. Overall, it appears that the economy turned in a reasonably good\nperformance in the third quarter as well. Output growth appears to have been pretty solid\neven though growth in payroll employment in the private sector slowed noticeably in\nAugust and September to only 52,000 jobs on average from an average of 111,000 jobs\nover the prior six months. Recent data on personal consumption expenditures have been\nrobust. Manufacturing output and orders for core capital goods have been upbeat, and\nbusiness investment in equipment and software promises to be a bright spot. Despite the\nhike in borrowing costs for higher-risk corporate borrowers and the illiquidity in markets\nfor collateralized loan obligations, it appears that financing for capital spending for most\nfirms remains readily available on terms that have been little affected by the recent\nfinancial turmoil.\nThat said, most of these data are too early to reflect the effects of the financial\nturmoil, and those effects are more likely to show up in data for the current quarter.\nIndeed, the financial shock seems likely to intensify an already steep downturn in\nhousing. As I noted, mortgage interest rates have risen and these increases seem likely to\nexert some negative impact on this sector. More important, in my view, are the potential\neffects stemming from disruptions to the availability of credit and the tightening of\n7\n\nmortgage lending standards that are occurring. The illiquidity in many segments of the\nmarket for mortgage-backed securities seems likely to limit credit flows and therefore to\nhave at least some negative effect on real residential construction, depending on how long\nthe disruptions persist. A key point is that, even as liquidity in mortgage-backed\nsecurities markets improves, the risk spreads incorporated in mortgage rates will likely\nremain higher on a long-term basis than they have been in recent years, and this could\nprolong the adjustment in the housing sector.\nIndeed, forward-looking indicators of conditions in housing markets were\npointing lower even before the financial market turmoil began. Housing permits and sales\nwere trending down. Inventories of unsold new homes remained at very high levels, and\nthey will need to be worked off before construction can begin to rebound. Finally, most\nmeasures of house prices at the national level fell moderately. Notably, despite these\ndeclines, the ratio of house prices to rents—a kind of price-dividend ratio for housing—\nremains quite high by historical standards, suggesting that further price declines may be\nneeded to bring housing markets into balance. This perspective is reinforced by futures\nmarkets for house prices, which expect further declines in a number of metropolitan areas\nthis year. The downturn in house prices would likely be intensified by a simultaneous\ndecline in employment, should that occur, since significant job loss would weaken\ndemand for housing and raise foreclosures.\nHere in California, the rise and fall of house prices has been much like the\nnation’s, only more so. In 2004 and 2005, many homeowners gleefully watched the meter\ntick up and up and up on their house values. But since then, things have changed\ndramatically. The pace of home sales has slowed substantially, and virtually every\n8\n\nmetropolitan area in California has seen much larger downward swings in the pace of\nhouse price appreciation than the nation. In fact, the majority of them have recorded\noutright declines in average house prices over the past year. As I’m sure you know, these\ndevelopments have hit close to home here in Southern California, where the once hot\nhousing markets have cooled considerably.\nCalifornia also has played a significant role in the problems with subprime\nmortgages that have swept the nation. This state used to have one of the lowest subprime\ndelinquency rates in the U.S., but more recently it has seen them increase dramatically, so\nthat now California ranks about in the middle of the states on this scale. Moreover, within\nthe state, the various regions exemplify a wide range of experiences with problem loans.\nBy one measure of delinquencies on all types of mortgages, three metro areas—the\nInland Empire and Merced and Stockton in the Central Valley—are in the top ten in the\nentire U.S. In contrast, here in the Los Angeles-Long Beach area, delinquency rates are\nrunning at about the middle of the pack among metro areas for the country.\nNow let me return to the national economy. Beyond the housing sector’s direct\nimpact on GDP growth, a significant issue is its impact on personal consumption\nexpenditures, which have been the main engine of growth in recent years. Indeed, data on\nconsumption spending in the last few months have continued to show strength. The\nnature and extent of the linkages between housing and consumer spending, however, are\na topic of debate among economists. Some believe that these linkages run mainly through\ntotal wealth, of which housing wealth is a part. Others argue that house prices affect\nconsumer spending by changing the value of mortgage equity. Less equity, for example,\nreduces the quantity of funds available for credit-constrained consumers to borrow\n9\n\nthrough home equity loans or to withdraw through refinancing. The key point is that,\naccording to both theories, a drop in house prices is likely to restrain consumer spending\nto some extent, and this view is backed up by empirical research on the U.S. economy.\nIndeed, in the new environment of higher rates and tighter terms on mortgages,\nwe may see other negative impacts on consumer spending. The reduced availability of\nhigh loan-to-value ratio and piggyback loans may drive some would-be homeowners to\npull back on consumption in order to save for a sizable down payment. In addition,\ncredit-constrained consumers with adjustable-rate mortgages seem likely to curtail\nspending, as interest rates reset at higher levels and they find themselves with less\ndisposable income.\nAnother engine of growth that could be a little weaker going forward due to the\nongoing turmoil is foreign economic activity. Foreign real GDP—weighted by U.S.\nexport shares—advanced at robust rates of 3¾ to 4 percent in 2004 and through the first\nquarter of this year. This growth was widespread, affecting nearly every continent. With\nthe trade-weighted dollar falling over this same period, U.S. exports have been strong—\nreal exports increased by an average of nearly 8 percent during 2004 through 2006. Partly\nfor this reason, U.S. net exports, which consistently held growth down from 2000 to\n2005, actually gave it a lift during 2006. Before the recent global financial turmoil, I had\nassumed a modest deceleration in world economic activity, which meant that net exports\nwere likely to “turn neutral”—neither retarding nor stimulating growth in the year or so\nahead. At this point, it’s still very difficult to gauge the likelihood of this “neutral”\nscenario, but it does seem safe to say that these developments add some downside risks to\nit.\n10\n\nTo sum up the story on the outlook for aggregate demand, I see downward\npressure based on recent data indicating further weakening in the housing sector and the\ntightening of financial markets. As I have indicated, a big issue is whether developments\nin the relatively small housing sector will spread to the large consumption sector, perhaps\nthrough declines in house prices. Should the decline in house prices occur in the context\nof rising unemployment, the risks could be significant.\nTurning to inflation, signs of improvement in underlying inflationary pressures\nare evident in recent data. Over the past twelve months, the price index for personal\nconsumption expenditures excluding food and energy, or the core PCE price index, has\nincreased by 1.8 percent. Just several months ago, the twelve-month change was quite a\nbit higher, at nearly 2½ percent. It wouldn’t surprise me if core PCE price inflation edged\ndown a little bit more over the next few years. This view is predicated on continued well-\nanchored inflation expectations. It also assumes the emergence of some slack in the labor\nmarket, as well as the ebbing of the upward effects of movements in energy and\ncommodity prices. However, we do still face some inflation risks, mainly due to faster\nincreases in unit labor costs and the depreciation of the dollar, and these will need to be\nwatched carefully.\nWith that view of recent financial developments and the outlook for the U.S.\neconomy, I’d like to turn to monetary policy. On September 18, the FOMC reduced the\nfederal funds rate target by 50 basis points. In the accompanying press release, the\nCommittee noted that the financial shock has the potential to intensify the housing\ncorrection and to restrain economic growth more generally. The action at the September\n11\n\nmeeting was meant to help “forestall” some of the potential fallout to the economy from\nthe disruptions in financial markets and to promote moderate growth over time.\nThe Committee’s decision reflected a forward-looking and preemptive approach\nto policy. The policy move was not primarily a reaction to data in hand at the time of the\nmeeting. Under the circumstances, available information on spending and output mainly\nreflected conditions before the financial disruptions began and was therefore less\ninformative than under normal conditions about the appropriate stance of policy.\nI believe that it was important to put a substantial easing in place in September so\nas not to fall “behind the curve.” Given the long lags between policy actions and their\nimpact on the economy, and the possibility that economic downturns can be difficult to\nreverse once they take hold, a more gradual and reactive approach would have created\nunnecessary economic risks. That said, it is inherently difficult to assess the stance of\npolicy that is needed to ensure that the economy would grow at a moderate pace given\nuncertainties about financial developments and their impact on the economy.\nI view the Committee’s decision as reflecting a sensible balance in striving to\nachieve our twin goals—maximum sustainable employment and low inflation. The\nCommittee noted in its statement that “some inflation risks remain.” I nevertheless\nconsidered the larger-than-usual cut in the funds rate prudent because of two features of\nthe current environment. First, the stance of monetary policy before the September\nmeeting was probably a bit on the restrictive side, at least according to many estimates of\nthe so-called “neutral” or “equilibrium” federal funds rate. In fact, the stance of policy\nwas growing more restrictive as core inflation gradually trended down. Second, with the\neconomy operating near potential and inflation well contained, a case could have been\n12\n\nmade that the funds rate would need to move down toward a neutral stance, even if there\nhad not been a financial shock.\nFinally, I’d like to emphasize what I hope my talk has already made clear—that\nthese are uncertain times. Any forecast and any analysis of events should be made with a\ngreat deal of humility about its correctness. And that’s why I am keeping an open mind\nabout prospects for the future and why the Committee stressed, to quote from the\nstatement, that it: “will continue to assess the effects of these and other developments on\neconomic prospects and will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable\neconomic growth.”\nI’d be pleased to take any questions.\n# # #\n13",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n8:00 p.m. EDT\nJune 6, 2012\nPerspectives on Monetary Policy\nRemarks by\nJanet L. Yellen\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nBoston Economic Club Dinner\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nBoston, Massachusetts\nJune 6, 2012\n\nGood evening. I’m honored to have the opportunity to address the Boston Economic\nClub and I’m grateful to Chip Case for inviting me to speak to you tonight. As most of you\nprobably know, Chip was one of the first economists to document worrisome signs of a housing\nbubble in parts of the United States. After sounding an early alarm in 2003, Chip watched the\nbubble grow and was prescient in anticipating the very serious toll that its unwinding would\nimpose on the economy. Chip recognized that declining house prices would affect not just\nresidential construction but also consumer spending, the ability of households to borrow, and the\nhealth of the financial system. In light of these pervasive linkages, the repeat sales house price\nindex that bears Chip’s name is one of the most closely watched of all U.S. economic indicators.\nIndeed, as I will discuss this evening, prolonged weakness in the housing sector remains one of\nseveral serious headwinds facing the U.S. economy. Given these headwinds, I believe that a\nhighly accommodative monetary policy will be needed for quite some time to help the economy\nmend. Before continuing, let me emphasize that my remarks reflect my own views and not\nnecessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.1\nEconomic Conditions and the Outlook\nIn my remarks tonight, I will describe my perspective on monetary policy. To begin,\nhowever, I’ll highlight some of the current conditions and key features of the economic outlook\nthat shape my views. To anticipate the main points, the economy appears to be expanding at a\nmoderate pace. The unemployment rate is almost 1 percentage point lower than it was a year\nago, but we are still far from full employment. Looking ahead, I anticipate that significant\nheadwinds will continue to restrain the pace of the recovery so that the remaining employment\n1 I appreciate assistance from members of the Board’s staff--Jon Faust, Thomas Laubach, Andrew Levin, and David\nReifschneider--who contributed to the preparation of these remarks.\n\n- 2 -\ngap is likely to close only slowly. At the same time, inflation (abstracting from the transitory\neffects of movements in oil prices) has been running near 2 percent over the past two years, and I\nexpect it to remain at or below the Federal Open Market Committee’s (the FOMC’s) 2 percent\nobjective for the foreseeable future. As always, considerable uncertainty attends the outlook for\nboth growth and inflation; events could prove either more positive or negative than what I see as\nthe most likely outcome. That said, as I will explain, I consider the balance of risks to be tilted\ntoward a weaker economy.\nStarting with the labor market, conditions have gradually improved over the past year,\nalbeit at an uneven pace. Average monthly payroll gains picked up from about 145,000 in the\nsecond half of 2011 to 225,000 during the first quarter of this year. However, these gains fell\nback to around 75,000 a month in April and May. The deceleration of payroll employment from\nthe first to the second quarter was probably exacerbated by some combination of seasonal\nadjustment difficulties and an unusually mild winter that likely boosted employment growth\nearlier in the year. Payback for that earlier strength probably accounts for some of the weakness\nwe’ve seen recently. Smoothing through these fluctuations, the average pace of job creation for\nthe year to date, as well as recent unemployment benefit claims data and other indicators, appear\nto be consistent with an economy expanding at only a moderate rate, close to its potential.\nSuch modest growth would imply little additional progress in the near term in improving\nlabor market conditions, which remain very weak. Currently, the unemployment rate stands\naround 3 percentage points above where it was at the onset of the recession--a figure that is stark\nenough as it is, but does not even take account of the millions more who have left the labor force\nor who would have joined under more normal circumstances in the past four years. All told,\nonly about half of the collapse in private payroll employment in 2008 and 2009 has been\n\n- 3 -\nreversed. A critical question for monetary policy is the extent to which these numbers reflect a\nshortfall from full employment versus a rise in structural unemployment. While the magnitude\nof structural unemployment is uncertain, I read the evidence as suggesting that the bulk of the\nrise during the recession was cyclical, not structural in nature.\nConsider figure 1, which presents three indicators of labor market slack. The black solid\nline is the unemployment gap, defined as the difference between the actual unemployment rate\nand the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimate of the rate consistent with inflation\nremaining stable over time. The red dashed line is an index of the difficulty households perceive\nin finding jobs, based on results from a survey conducted by the Conference Board. And the red\ndotted line is an index of firms’ ability to fill jobs, based on a survey conducted by the National\nFederation of Independent Business. All three measures show similar cyclical movements over\nthe past 20 years, and all now stand at very high levels. This similarity runs counter to claims\nthat the CBO’s and other estimates of the unemployment gap overstate the true amount of slack\nby placing insufficient weight on structural explanations, such as a reduced efficiency of\nmatching workers to jobs, for the rise in unemployment since 2007. If that were the case, why\nwould firms now find it so easy to fill positions? Other evidence also points to the dominant role\nof cyclical forces in the recent rise in unemployment: job losses have been widespread, rather\nthan being concentrated in the construction and financial sectors, and the co-movement of job\nvacancies and unemployment over the past few years does not appear to be unusual.2\nAs I mentioned, I expect several factors to restrain the pace of the recovery and the\ncorresponding improvement in the labor market going forward. The housing sector remains a\n2 For further discussion of evidence of labor market slack, see Janet L. Yellen (2012), “The Economic Outlook and\nMonetary Policy,” speech delivered at the Money Marketeers of New York University, New York, April 11,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20120411a.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nsource of very significant headwinds. Housing has typically been a driver of economic\nrecoveries, and we have seen some modest improvement recently, but continued uncertainties\nover the direction of house prices, and very restricted mortgage credit availability for all but the\nmost creditworthy buyers, will likely weigh on housing demand for some time to come. When\nhousing demand does pick up more noticeably, the huge overhang of both unoccupied dwellings\nand homes in the foreclosure pipeline will likely allow a good deal of that demand to be met for\na time without a sizeable expansion in homebuilding. Moreover, the enormous toll on household\nwealth resulting from the collapse of house prices--almost a 35 percent decline from its 2006\npeak, according to the Case-Shiller index--imposes ongoing restraint on consumer spending, and\nthe loss of home equity has impaired many households’ ability to borrow.\nA second headwind that will likely become more important over coming months relates\nto fiscal policy. At the federal level, stimulus-related policies are scheduled to wind down, while\nboth defense and nondefense purchases are expected to decline in inflation-adjusted terms over\nthe next several years. Toward the end of this year, important decisions regarding the extension\nof current federal tax and budget policies loom. I will return to the associated uncertainties and\ntheir potentially detrimental effects later.\nA third factor weighing on the outlook is the likely sluggish pace of economic growth\nabroad. Strains in global financial markets have resurfaced in recent months, reflecting renewed\nuncertainty about the resolution of the European situation. Risk premiums on sovereign debt and\nother securities have risen again in many European countries, while European banks continue to\nface pressure to shrink their balance sheets. Even without a further intensification of stresses, the\nslowdown in economic activity in Europe will likely hold back U.S. export growth. Moreover,\n\n- 5 -\nthe perceived risks surrounding the European situation are already having a meaningful effect on\nfinancial conditions here in the United States, further weighing on the prospects for U.S. growth.\nGiven these formidable challenges, most private sector forecasters expect only gradual\nimprovement in the labor market and I share their view. Figure 2 shows the unemployment rate\ntogether with the median forecast from last month’s Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF),\nthe dashed blue line.3 The figure also shows the central tendency of the unemployment\nprojections that my FOMC colleagues and I made at our April meeting: Those projections reflect\nour assessments of the economic outlook given our own individual judgments about the\nappropriate path of monetary policy. Included in the figure as well is the central tendency of\nFOMC participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate, which ranges from\n5.2 percent to 6 percent. Like private forecasters, most FOMC participants expect the\nunemployment rate to remain well above its longer-run normal value over the next several years.\nOf course, considerable uncertainty attends this outlook: The shaded area provides an\nestimate of the 70 percent confidence interval for the future path of the unemployment rate based\non historical experience and model simulations.4 Its width suggests that these projections could\nbe quite far off, in either direction. Nevertheless, the figure shows that labor market slack at\npresent is so large that even a very large and favorable forecast error would not change the\nconclusion that slack will likely remain substantial for quite some time.\n3 The SPF released in May provides forecasts on a quarterly basis through mid-2013 and annual projections beyond\nthat date. To construct quarterly forecasts through the end of 2014, I interpolate the annual projections.\n4 The forecast confidence interval is generated using stochastic simulations of the Federal Reserve staff’s FRB/US\nmodel. Specifically, a baseline is constructed centered on the median of the SPF projections released in May, and\nthen the model is repeatedly simulated with shocks drawn from the set of historical disturbances experienced over\nthe period from 1968 to 2011. Similar estimates of forecast confidence intervals would be obtained if the intervals\nwere instead constructed using the actual historical forecast errors of private forecasters; for further discussion, see\ntable 2 of the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections, an addendum to the April Federal Open Market\nCommittee minutes, available at Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012), “Minutes of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee, April 24-25, 2012,” press release, May 16,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20120516a.htm.\n\n- 6 -\nTurning to inflation, figure 3 summarizes private and FOMC forecasts. Overall\nconsumer price inflation has fluctuated quite a bit in recent years, largely reflecting movements\nin prices for oil and other commodities. In early 2011 and again earlier this year, prices of crude\noil, and thus of gasoline, rose noticeably. Smoothing through these fluctuations, inflation as\nmeasured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) averaged near 2\npercent over the past two years. In recent weeks, however, oil and gasoline prices have\nmoderated and are now showing through to the headline inflation figures. Looking ahead, most\nFOMC participants at the time of our April meeting expected inflation to be at, or a bit below,\nour long-run objective of 2 percent through 2014; private forecasters on average also expect\ninflation to be close to 2 percent. As with unemployment, uncertainty around the inflation\nprojection is substantial.\nIn the view of some observers, the stability of inflation in the face of high unemployment\nin recent years constitutes evidence that much of the remaining unemployment is structural and\nnot cyclical. They reason that if there were truly substantial slack in the labor market, simple\naccelerationist “Phillips curve” models would predict more noticeable downward pressure on\ninflation. However, substantial cross-country evidence suggests that, in low-inflation\nenvironments, inflation is notably less responsive to downward pressure from labor market slack\nthan it is when inflation is elevated. In other words, the short-run Phillips curve may flatten out.5\nOne important reason for this non-linearity, in my view, is downward nominal wage rigidity--\nthat is, the reluctance or inability of many firms to cut nominal wages.\n5 The simplest accelerationist version of the Phillips curve relates the change in inflation to the level of labor market\nslack; more-complicated versions also highlight the influence of inflation expectations, changes in marginal\nproduction costs, and other factors. Evidence for the United States and other countries that the sensitivity of\ninflation to resource slack may be nonlinear can be found in André Meier (2010), “Still Minding the Gap--Inflation\nDynamics during Episodes of Persistent Large Output Gaps,” IMF Working Paper WP/10/189 (Washington:\nInternational Monetary Fund, August), www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2010/wp10189.pdf.\n\n- 7 -\nThe solid blue bars in figure 4 present a snapshot of the distribution of nominal wage\nchanges for individual jobs during the depth of the current labor market slump, based on data\ncollected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.6 For comparison, the dashed red line presents a\nhypothetical distribution of wage changes, using a normal distribution that approximates the\nactual distribution of wage changes greater than zero. The distribution of actual wage changes\nshows that a relatively high percentage of workers saw no change in their nominal wage, and\nrelatively few experienced modest wage cuts. This pile-up phenomenon at zero suggests that,\neven when the unemployment rate was around 10 percent, many firms were reluctant to cut\nnominal wage rates. In the absence of this barrier, nominal gains in wages and unit labor costs\nwould have likely been even more subdued given the severity of the economic downturn, with\nthe result that inflation would probably now be running at a lower rate.\nAnchored inflation expectations are another reason why inflation has remained close to 2\npercent in the face of very low resource utilization. As shown in figure 5, survey measures of\nlonger-horizon inflation expectations have remained nearly constant since the mid-1990s even as\nactual inflation has fluctuated. As a result, the current slump has not generated the downward\nspiral of falling expected and actual inflation that a simple accelerationist model of inflation\nmight have predicted. Indeed, keeping inflation expectations from declining has been an\nimportant success of monetary policy over the past few years. At the same time, the fact that\nlonger-term inflation expectations have not risen above 2 percent has also proved extremely\n6 The data shown in figure 4 refer to the change in wages over the 12 months to March 2010. See Bruce Fallick,\nMichael Lettau, and William Wascher (2011), “Downward Nominal Wage Rigidity in the United States during the\nGreat Recession,” unpublished manuscript, November. Similar results, based on a different source of data, are\nreported in Mary Daly, Bart Hobijn, and Brian Lucking (2012), “Why Has Wage Growth Stayed Strong?” Federal\nReserve Bank of San Francisco, FRBSF Economic Letter 2012-10, April 2,\nwww.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2012/el2012-10.html. I have explored the implications of downward\nnominal rigidity for the Phillips curve and stabilization policy in greater depth in Janet L. Yellen and George A.\nAkerlof (2006), “Stabilization Policy: A Reconsideration,” Economic Inquiry, vol. 44 (January), pp. 1-22.\n\n- 8 -\nvaluable, for it has freed the FOMC to take strong actions to support the economic recovery\nwithout greatly worrying that higher energy and commodity prices would become ingrained in\ninflation and inflation expectations, as they did in the 1970s.\nWhile my modal outlook calls for only a gradual reduction in labor market slack and a\nstable pace of inflation near the FOMC’s longer-run objective of 2 percent, I see substantial risks\nto this outlook, particularly to the downside. As I mentioned before, even without any political\ngridlock, fiscal policy is bound to become substantially less accommodative from early 2013 on.\nHowever, federal fiscal policy could turn even more restrictive if the Congress does not reach\nagreement on several important tax and budget policy issues before the end of this year; in fact,\nthe CBO recently warned that the potential hit to gross domestic product (GDP) growth could be\nsufficient to push the economy into recession in 2013.7 The deterioration of financial conditions\nin Europe of late, coupled with notable declines in global equity markets, also serve as a\nreminder that highly destabilizing outcomes cannot be ruled out. Finally, besides these clearly\nidentifiable sources of risk, there remains the broader issue that economic forecasters have\nrepeatedly overestimated the strength of the recovery and so still may be too optimistic about the\nprospects that growth will strengthen.\nAlthough I view the bulk of the increase in unemployment since 2007 as cyclical, I am\nconcerned that it could become a permanent problem if the recovery were to stall. In this\neconomic downturn, the fraction of the workforce unemployed for six months or more has\nclimbed much more than in previous recessions, and remains at a remarkably high level.\nContinued high unemployment could wreak long-term damage by eroding the skills and labor\n7 See Congressional Budget Office (2012), Economic Effects of Reducing the Fiscal Restraint That Is Scheduled to\nOccur in 2013 (Washington: CBO, May),\nwww.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/FiscalRestraint_0.pdf.\n\n- 9 -\nforce attachment of workers suffering long-term unemployment, thereby turning what was\ninitially cyclical into structural unemployment. This risk provides another important reason to\nsupport the recovery by maintaining a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy.\nThe Conduct of Policy with Unconventional Tools\nNow turning to monetary policy, I will begin by discussing the FOMC’s reliance on\nunconventional tools to address the disappointing pace of recovery. I will then elaborate my\nrationale for supporting a highly accommodative policy stance.\nAs you know, since late 2008, the FOMC’s standard policy tool, the target federal funds\nrate, has been maintained at the zero lower bound. To provide further accommodation, we have\nemployed two unconventional tools to support the recovery--extended forward guidance about\nthe future path of the federal funds rate, and large-scale asset purchases and other balance sheet\nactions that have greatly increased the size and duration of the Federal Reserve’s portfolio.\nThese two tools have become increasingly important because the recovery from the\nrecession has turned out to be persistently slower than either the FOMC or private forecasters\nanticipated. Figure 6 illustrates the magnitude of the disappointment by comparing Blue Chip\nforecasts for real GDP growth made two years ago with ones made earlier this year. As shown\nby the dashed blue line, private forecasters in early 2010 anticipated that real GDP would expand\nat an average annual rate of just over 3 percent from 2010 through 2014. However, actual\ngrowth in 2011 and early 2012 has turned out to be much weaker than expected, and, as\nindicated by the dotted red line, private forecasters now anticipate only a modest acceleration in\nreal activity over the next few years.\nIn response to the evolving outlook, the FOMC has progressively added policy\naccommodation using both of its unconventional tools. For example, since the federal funds rate\n\n- 10 -\ntarget was brought down to a range of 0 to 1/4 percent in December 2008, the FOMC has\ngradually adjusted its forward guidance about the anticipated future path of the federal funds\nrate. In each meeting statement from March 2009 through June 2011, the Committee indicated\nits expectation that economic conditions “are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the\nfederal funds rate for an extended period.”8 At the August 2011 meeting, the Committee decided\nto provide more specific information about the likely time horizon by substituting the phrase “at\nleast through mid-2013” for the phrase “for an extended period”; at the January 2012 meeting,\nthis horizon was extended to “at least through late 2014.”9 Has this guidance worked? Figure 7\nillustrates how dramatically forecasters’ expectations of future short-term interest rates have\nchanged. As the dashed blue line indicates, the Blue Chip consensus forecast made in early 2010\nanticipated that the Treasury-bill rate would now stand at close to 3-1/2 percent; today, in\ncontrast, private forecasters expect short-term interest rates to remain very low in 2014.\nOf course, much of this revision in interest rate projections would likely have occurred in\nthe absence of explicit forward guidance; given the deterioration in projections of real activity\ndue to the unanticipated persistence of headwinds, and the continued subdued outlook for\ninflation, forecasters would naturally have anticipated a greater need for the FOMC to provide\ncontinued monetary accommodation. However, I believe the changes over time in the language\nof the FOMC statement, coupled with information provided by Chairman Bernanke and others in\nspeeches and congressional testimony, helped the public understand better the Committee’s\nlikely policy response given the slower-than-expected economic recovery. As a result,\n8 See, for example, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2009), “FOMC Statement,” press release,\nMarch 18, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20090318a.htm.\n9 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2011), “FOMC Statement,” press release, August 9,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20110809a.htm; and Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System (2012), “FOMC Statement,” press release, January 25,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20120125a.htm.\n\n- 11 -\nforecasters and market participants appear to have marked down their expectations for future\nshort-term interest rates by more than they otherwise would have, thereby putting additional\ndownward pressure on long-term interest rates, improving broader financial conditions, and\nlending support to aggregate demand.\nThe FOMC has also provided further monetary accommodation over time by altering the\nsize and composition of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings, shown in figure 8. The\nexpansion in the volume of securities held by the Federal Reserve is shown in the left panel of\nthe figure. During 2009 and early 2010, the Federal Reserve purchased about $1.4 trillion in\nagency mortgage-backed securities and agency debt securities and about $300 billion in longer-\nterm Treasury securities. In November 2010, the Committee initiated an additional $600 billion\nin purchases of longer-term Treasury securities, which were completed at the end of June of last\nyear. Last September, the FOMC decided to implement the “Maturity Extension Program,”\nwhich affected the maturity composition of our Treasury holdings as shown in the right panel.\nThrough this program, the FOMC is extending the average maturity of its securities holdings by\nselling $400 billion of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 3 years or less and\npurchasing an equivalent amount of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 6 to 30\nyears. These transactions are currently scheduled to be completed at the end of this month.\nResearch by Federal Reserve staff and others suggests that our balance sheet operations\nhave had substantial effects on longer-term Treasury yields, principally by reducing term\npremiums on longer-dated Treasury securities.10 Figure 9 provides an estimate, based on Federal\n10 The term premium on a longer-dated Treasury security is defined as the return that investors expect to earn on\nholding this security in excess of the return from rolling over short-dated Treasury securities, such as three-month\nTreasury bills. For estimates of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet actions on long-term interest rates, see Canlin\nLi and Min Wei (forthcoming), “Term Structure Modeling with Supply Factors and the Federal Reserve’s Large\nScale Asset Purchase Programs,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series (Washington: Board of Governors of\nthe Federal Reserve System); Joseph Gagnon, Matthew Raskin, Julie Remache, and Brian Sack (2010), “Large-\n\n- 12 -\nReserve Board staff calculations, of the cumulative reduction of the term premium on 10-year\nTreasury securities from the three balance sheet programs. These results suggest that our\nportfolio actions are currently keeping 10-year Treasury yields roughly 60 basis points lower\nthan they otherwise would be.11 Other evidence suggests that this downward pressure has had\nfavorable spillover effects on other financial markets, leading to lower long-term borrowing\ncosts for households and firms, higher equity valuations, and other improvements in financial\nconditions that in turn have supported consumption, investment, and net exports. Because the\nterm premium effect depends on both the Federal Reserve’s current and expected future asset\nholdings, most of this effect--without further actions--will likely wane over the next few years as\nScale Asset Purchases by the Federal Reserve: Did they Work?” Staff Report no. 441 (New York: Federal Reserve\nBank of New York, March), www.ny.frb.org/research/staff_reports/sr441.html; Hess Chung, Jean-Philippe Laforte,\nDavid Reifschneider, and John Williams (2012), “Have We Underestimated the Likelihood and Severity of Zero\nLower Bound Events?” supplement, Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, vol. 44 (S1, February), pp. 47-82;\nArvind Krishnamurthy and Annette Vissing-Jorgensen (2011), “The Effects of Quantitative Easing on Interest\nRates: Channels and Implications for Policy,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Fall, pp. 215-65,\nwww.brookings.edu/about/projects/bpea/editions/fall-2011; and James Hamilton and Jing Cynthia Wu (2012), “The\nEffectiveness of Alternative Monetary Policy Tools in a Zero Lower Bound Environment,” Journal of Money,\nCredit and Banking, vol. 44, Issue Supplement s1 (February), pp. 3-46.

These calculations require an assumption for market participants’ expectations for\nthe future path of the Federal Reserve’s portfolio at different points in time, both in the past and going forward;\naccordingly, the estimates are somewhat sensitive to alternative assumptions for market expectations. In estimating\nthe current and future effect of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings on term premiums, market participants are\nassumed to have expectations consistent with the illustrative baseline discussed in note 16 and the exit principles\noutlined by the FOMC in June 2011 (see note 18). In particular, investors are assumed to expect that the overall size\nand composition of the portfolio will remain roughly constant from the end of 2012:Q2 through late 2014 because\nprincipal payments on the Federal Reserve’s security holdings will be reinvested until a few months prior to the\nliftoff of the federal funds rate assumed in the illustrative baseline. At that point, the portfolio is assumed to begin to\ncontract through redemptions and, after the assumed liftoff of the federal funds rate, through sales of mortgage-\nbacked securities that bring the Federal Reserve’s holdings of such securities to zero over a three-to-five-year\nperiod. As a result, the size of the portfolio returns to normal within a few years after liftoff.\n\n- 13 -\nthe effect depends less and less on the current elevated level of the balance sheet and\nincreasingly on the level of holdings during and after the normalization of our portfolio.12\nThe Rationale for Highly Accommodative Policy\nI have already noted that, in my view, an extended period of highly accommodative\npolicy is necessary to combat the persistent headwinds to recovery. I will next explain how I’ve\nreached this policy judgment. In evaluating the stance of policy, I find the prescriptions from\nsimple policy rules a logical starting point. A wide range of such rules has been examined in the\nacademic literature, the most famous of which is that proposed by John Taylor in his 1993\nstudy.13 Rules of the general sort proposed by Taylor (1993) capture well our statutory mandate\nto promote maximum employment and price stability by prescribing that the federal funds rate\nshould respond to the deviation of inflation from its longer-run goal and to the output gap, given\nthat the economy should be at or close to full employment when the output gap--the difference\nbetween actual GDP and an estimate of potential output--is closed. Moreover, research suggests\nthat such simple rules can be reasonably robust to uncertainty about the true structure of the\neconomy, as they perform well in a variety of models.14 Today, I will consider the prescriptions\nof two such benchmark rules--Taylor’s 1993 rule, and a variant that is twice as responsive to\neconomic slack. In my view, this latter rule is more consistent with the FOMC’s commitment to\n12 The term premium effect also wanes over time because the size of the effect depends on the expected difference\nbetween the actual size of the balance sheet now and in the future and its normal size, where the latter is rising\nsteadily over time, primarily as a result of the trend growth in currency.\n13 See John B. Taylor (1993), “Discretion versus Policy Rules in Practice,” Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series\non Public Policy, vol. 39 (December), pp. 195-214.\n14 See the discussion in John B. Taylor and John C. Williams (2011), “Simple and Robust Rules for Monetary\nPolicy,” in Benjamin M. Friedman and Michael Woodford, eds., Handbook of Monetary Economics, vol. 3B (San\nDiego: North Holland), pp. 829-60.\n\n- 14 -\nfollow a balanced approach to promoting our dual mandate, and so I will refer to it as the\n“balanced-approach” rule.15\nTo show the prescriptions these rules would have called for at the April FOMC meeting, I\nstart with an illustrative baseline outlook constructed using the projections for unemployment,\ninflation, and the federal funds rate that FOMC participants reported in April.16 I then employ\nthe dynamics of one of the Federal Reserve’s economic models, the FRB/US model, to solve for\nthe joint paths of these three variables if the short-term interest rate had instead been set\naccording to the Taylor (1993) rule or the balanced-approach rule, subject, in both cases, to the\nzero lower bound constraint on the federal funds rate. The dashed red line in figure 10 shows the\nresulting path for the federal funds rate under Taylor (1993) and the solid blue line with open\ncircles illustrates the corresponding path using the balanced-approach rule.17 In both\nsimulations, the private sector fully understands that monetary policy follows the particular rule\nin force.18 Figure 10 shows that the Taylor rule calls for monetary policy to tighten immediately,\nwhile the balanced-approach rule prescribes raising the federal funds rate in the fourth quarter of\n15 The balanced-approach rule is defined as R = 2 + π + 0.5(π - 2) + 1.0Y. In this expression, R is the federal funds\nt t t t\nrate, π is the percent change in the headline personal consumption expenditures price index from four quarters\nearlier, and Y is the output gap. In a recent speech, I dubbed this rule “Taylor (1999),” as John Taylor described the\nrule in a paper published that year. Since Taylor’s own strong preference is for his original rule--Taylor (1993)--I\nnow refer to the later rule as the “balanced-approach rule.”\n16 The baseline paths for unemployment and inflation track the midpoint of the central tendency of the Committee’s\nprojections through 2014 and thereafter gradually converge to values consistent with participants’ long-run\nprojections. Similarly, the baseline path for the federal funds rate stays near zero through late 2014 and then rises\nsteadily back to the long-run value expected by most participants. While these assumptions are consistent with\nrecent FOMC statements, both the assumed date of liftoff and the longer-run pace of tightening are merely\nillustrative and are not based on any internal FOMC deliberations. For further details on the construction of the\nbaseline, see Yellen, “The Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy,” in note 2.\n17 Because both rules respond to the output gap, the projections for the unemployment rate need to be converted into\na path for the output gap. The output gap is approximated using Okun’s law; specifically, Y = 2.3(5.6-U), where\nt t\n2.3 is the estimated value of the Okun’s law coefficient and 5.6 is the assumed value of the non-accelerating\ninflation rate of unemployment, or NAIRU.\n18 In the simulations, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet is assumed to evolve in accordance with the exit strategy\nprinciples that the FOMC agreed upon at the June 2011 meeting. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem (2011), “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, June 21-22, 2011,” press release, July 12,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20110712a.htm.\n\n- 15 -\n2014--the earliest date consistent with the FOMC’s current forward guidance of “exceptionally\nlow levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014.”\nAlthough simple rules provide a useful starting point in determining appropriate policy,\nthey by no means deserve the “last word”--especially in current circumstances. An alternative\napproach, also illustrated in figure 10, is to compute an “optimal control” path for the federal\nfunds rate using an economic model--FRB/US, in this case. Such a path is chosen to minimize\nthe value of a specific “loss function” conditional on a baseline forecast of economic conditions.\nThe loss function attempts to quantify the social costs resulting from deviations of inflation from\nthe Committee’s longer-run goal and from deviations of unemployment from its longer-run\nnormal rate.19 The solid green line with dots in figure 10 shows the “optimal control” path for\nthe federal funds rate, again conditioned on the illustrative baseline outlook.20 This policy\ninvolves keeping the federal funds rate close to zero until late 2015, four quarters longer than the\nbalanced-approach rule prescription and several years longer than the Taylor rule. Importantly,\noptimal control calls for a later lift-off date even though this benchmark--unlike the simple\npolicy rules--implicitly takes full account of the additional stimulus to real activity and inflation\n19 Under this approach, the central bank’s plans are assumed to be completely transparent and credible to the public.\nIn particular, both the policymaker and private agents are assumed to act as if they have perfect foresight about the\nevolution of the economy, including the future path of monetary policy, in that they ignore the possibility of\nunanticipated future shocks to the economy. This assumption of “certainty equivalence” is commonly used but is\nnot an intrinsic feature of optimal control techniques. Indeed, the fully optimal policy under uncertainty involves the\nspecification of a complete set of state-contingent policy paths.\n20 This procedure involves two steps. First, the FRB/US model’s projections of real activity, inflation, and interest\nrates are adjusted to replicate the baseline forecast values. Second, a search procedure is used to solve for the path\nof the federal funds rate that minimizes the value of an assumed loss function, allowing for feedback of changes in\nthe federal funds rate from baseline to real activity and inflation. For the purposes of the exercise, the loss function\nis equal to the cumulative discounted sum from 2012:Q2 through 2025:Q4 of three factors--the squared deviation of\nthe unemployment rate from 5-1/2 percent, the squared deviation of overall PCE inflation from 2 percent, and the\nsquared quarterly change in the federal funds rate. The third term is added to damp quarter-to-quarter movements in\ninterest rates.\n\n- 16 -\nbeing provided over time by the Federal Reserve’s other policy tool, the past and projected\nchanges to the size and maturity of its securities holdings.21\nFigure 11 shows that, by keeping the federal funds rate at its current level for longer,\nmonetary policy under the balanced-approach rule achieves a more rapid reduction of the\nunemployment rate than monetary policy under the Taylor (1993) rule does, while nonetheless\nkeeping inflation near 2 percent. But the improvement in labor market conditions is even more\nnotable under the optimal control path, even as inflation remains close to the FOMC’s long-run\ninflation objective.\nAs I noted, simple rules have the advantage of delivering good policy outcomes across a\nbroad range of models, and are thereby relatively robust to our limited understanding of the\nprecise working of the economy--in contrast to optimal-control policies, whose prescriptions are\nsensitive to the specification of the particular model used in the analysis. However, simple rules\nalso have their shortcomings, leading them to significantly understate the case for keeping policy\npersistently accommodative in current circumstances.\nOne of these shortcomings is that the rules do not adjust for the constraints that the zero\nlower bound has placed on conventional monetary policy since late 2008. A second is that they\ndo not fully take account of the protracted nature of the forces that have been restraining\naggregate demand in the aftermath of the housing bust. As I’ve emphasized, the pace of the\ncurrent recovery has turned out to be persistently slower than most observers expected, and\nforecasters expect it to remain quite moderate by historical standards. The headwinds that\nexplain this disappointing performance represent a substantial departure from normal cyclical\n21 Optimal control takes account of the stimulus provided by the balance sheet operations because it conditions on a\nbaseline forecast of real activity and inflation that (at least implicitly) incorporates the effects of the Federal\nReserve’s balance sheet operations on projected financial conditions, real activity, and inflation.\n\n- 17 -\ndynamics. As a result, the economy’s equilibrium real federal funds rate--that is, the rate that\nwould be consistent with full employment over the medium run--is probably well below its\nhistorical average, which the intercept of simple policy rules is supposed to approximate. By\nfailing to fully adjust for this decline, the prescriptions of simple policy rules--which provide a\nuseful benchmark under normal circumstances--could be significantly too restrictive now and\ncould remain so for some time to come. In this regard, I think it is informative that the Blue\nChip consensus forecast released in March showed the real three-month Treasury bill rate\nsettling down at only 1-1/4 percent late in the decade, down 120 basis points from the long-run\nprojections made prior to the recession. 22\nLooking Ahead\nRecent labor market reports and financial developments serve as a reminder that the\neconomy remains vulnerable to setbacks. Indeed, the simulations I described above did not take\ninto account this new information. In our policy deliberations at the upcoming FOMC meeting\nwe will assess the effects of these developments on the economic forecast. If the Committee\nwere to judge that the recovery is unlikely to proceed at a satisfactory pace (for example, that the\nforecast entails little or no improvement in the labor market over the next few years), or that the\ndownside risks to the outlook had become sufficiently great, or that inflation appeared to be in\ndanger of declining notably below its 2 percent objective, I am convinced that scope remains for\nthe FOMC to provide further policy accommodation either through its forward guidance or\nthrough additional balance-sheet actions. In taking these decisions, however, we would need to\nbalance two considerations.\n22 For a further discussion of this issue, see William C. Dudley (2012), “Conducting Monetary Policy: Rules,\nLearning and Risk Management,” speech delivered at the C. Peter McColough Series on International Economics,\nCouncil on Foreign Relations, New York, May 24,\nwww.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2012/dud120524.html.\n\n- 18 -\nOn the one hand, our unconventional tools have some limitations and costs. For\nexample, the effects of forward guidance are likely to be weaker the longer the horizon of the\nguidance, implying that it may be difficult to provide much more stimulus through this channel.\nAs for our balance sheet operations, although we have now acquired some experience with this\ntool, there is still considerable uncertainty about its likely economic effects. Moreover, some\nhave expressed concern that a substantial further expansion of the balance sheet could interfere\nwith the Fed’s ability to execute a smooth exit from its accommodative policies at the\nappropriate time. I disagree with this view: The FOMC has tested a variety of tools to ensure\nthat we will be able to raise short-term interest rates when needed while gradually returning the\nportfolio to a more normal size and composition. But even if unjustified, such concerns could in\ntheory reduce confidence in the Federal Reserve and so lead to an undesired increase in inflation\nexpectations.\nOn the other hand, risk management considerations arising from today’s unusual\ncircumstances strengthen the case for additional accommodation beyond that called for by simple\npolicy rules and optimal control under the modal outlook. In particular, as I have noted, there are\na number of significant downside risks to the economic outlook, and hence it may well be\nappropriate to insure against adverse shocks that could push the economy into territory where a\nself-reinforcing downward spiral of economic weakness would be difficult to arrest.\nConclusion\nIn my remarks this evening I have sought to explain why, in my view, a highly\naccommodative monetary policy will remain appropriate for some time to come. My views\nconcerning the stance of monetary policy reflect the FOMC’s firm commitment to the goals of\nmaximum employment and stable prices, my appraisal of the medium term outlook (which is\n\n- 19 -\nimportantly shaped by the persistent legacy of the housing bust and ensuing financial crisis), and\nby my assessment of the balance of risks facing the economy. Of course, as I’ve emphasized, the\noutlook is uncertain and the Committee will need to adjust policy as appropriate as actual\nconditions unfold. For this reason, the FOMC’s forward guidance is explicitly conditioned on its\nanticipation of “low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the\nmedium run.”23 If the recovery were to proceed faster than expected or if inflation pressures\nwere to pick up materially, the FOMC could adjust policy by bringing forward the expected date\nof tightening. In contrast, if the Committee judges that the recovery is proceeding at an\ninsufficient pace, we could undertake portfolio actions such as additional asset purchases or a\nfurther maturity extension program. It is for this reason that the FOMC emphasized, in its\nstatement following the April meeting, that it would “regularly review the size and composition\nof its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate to promote a\nstronger economic recovery in a context of price stability.”24\n23 See Board of Governors, “FOMC Statement,” January 25, in note 9.\n24 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012), “FOMC Statement,” press release, April 25,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20120425a.htm.\n\nPerspectives on\nMonetary Policy\nJanet L.

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Fostering a Dynamic Global Recovery,” a symposium sponsored by\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\nJackson Hole, Wyoming\nAugust 25, 2017\n\nA decade has passed since the beginnings of a global financial crisis that resulted\nin the most severe financial panic and largest contraction in economic activity in the\nUnited States since the Great Depression. Already, for some, memories of this\nexperience may be fading--memories of just how costly the financial crisis was and of\nwhy certain steps were taken in response. Today I will look back at the crisis and discuss\nthe reforms policymakers in the United States and around the world have made to\nimprove financial regulation to limit both the probability and the adverse consequences of\nfuture financial crises.\nA resilient financial system is critical to a dynamic global economy--the subject\nof this conference. A well-functioning financial system facilitates productive investment\nand new business formation and helps new and existing businesses weather the ups and\ndowns of the business cycle. Prudent borrowing enables households to improve their\nstandard of living by purchasing a home, investing in education, or starting a business.\nBecause of the reforms that strengthened our financial system, and with support from\nmonetary and other policies, credit is available on good terms, and lending has advanced\nbroadly in line with economic activity in recent years, contributing to today’s strong\neconomy.1\nAt the same time, reforms have boosted the resilience of the financial system.\nBanks are safer. The risk of runs owing to maturity transformation is reduced. Efforts to\nenhance the resolvability of systemic firms have promoted market discipline and reduced\n1 Over the 12 quarters ending in the first quarter of this year, borrowing by the nonfinancial business sector\nincreased at an annual rate just above 6 percent, on average, and borrowing by households and nonprofit\ninstitutions rose at an annual rate of 3-1/4 percent, on average; the corresponding average pace of increase\nin nominal gross domestic product was 3-3/4 percent. Over the same period, lending by private depository\ninstitutions advanced at an annual rate of nearly 6-1/2 percent.\n\n- 2 -\nthe problem of too-big-to-fail. And a system is in place to more effectively monitor and\naddress risks that arise outside the regulatory perimeter.\nNonetheless, the scope and complexity of financial regulatory reforms demand\nthat policymakers and researchers remain alert to both areas for improvement and\nunexpected side effects. The Federal Reserve is committed to continuing to evaluate the\neffects of regulation on financial stability and on the broader economy and to making\nappropriate adjustments.\nI will start by reviewing where we were 10 years ago. I will then walk through\nsome key reforms our country has put in place to diminish the chances of another severe\ncrisis and limit damage during times of financial instability. After reviewing these steps,\nI will summarize indicators and research that show the improved resilience of the U.S.\nfinancial system--resilience that is due importantly to regulatory reform as well as actions\ntaken by the private sector. I will then turn to the evidence regarding how financial\nregulatory reform has affected economic growth, credit availability, and market liquidity.\nDevelopments 10 Years Ago\nThe U.S. and global financial system was in a dangerous place 10 years ago. U.S.\nhouse prices had peaked in 2006, and strains in the subprime mortgage market grew acute\nover the first half of 2007.2 By August, liquidity in money markets had deteriorated\nenough to require the Federal Reserve to take steps to support it.3 And yet the discussion\n2 A contemporaneous perspective on subprime mortgage market developments at this time is provided in\nBen S. Bernanke (2007), “The Subprime Mortgage Market,” speech delivered at the Federal Reserve Bank\nof Chicago’s 43rd Annual Conference on Bank Structure and Competition, Chicago, May 17,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20070517a.htm.\n3 On August 17, 2007, the Federal Reserve Board reduced the primary credit rate at the discount window\nby 50 basis points and announced a change to the Reserve Banks’ usual practices to allow the provision of\nterm financing for as long as 30 days, renewable by the borrower. The changes were announced to remain\nin place until the Federal Reserve determined that market liquidity had improved materially. See Board of\n\n- 3 -\nhere at Jackson Hole in August 2007, with a few notable exceptions, was fairly optimistic\nabout the possible economic fallout from the stresses apparent in the financial system.4\nAs we now know, the deterioration of liquidity and solvency within the financial\nsector continued over the next 13 months. Accumulating strains across the financial\nsystem, including the collapse of Bear Stearns in March 2008, made it clear that\nvulnerabilities had risen across the system. As a result, policymakers took extraordinary\nmeasures: The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sharply cut the federal funds\nrate, and the Federal Reserve, in coordination with the Treasury Department and other\nagencies, extended liquidity facilities beyond the traditional banking sector, applying to\nthe modern structure of U.S. money markets the dictum of Walter Bagehot, conceived in\nthe 19th century, to lend freely against good collateral at a penalty rate.5 Still, the\ndeterioration in the financial sector continued, with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac failing\nin early September.6\nBut the deterioration from early 2007 until early September 2008--already the\nworst financial disruption in the United States in many decades--was a slow trickle\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System (2007), “Federal Reserve Board Discount Rate Action,” press\nrelease, August 17, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20070817a.htm.\n4 The proceedings from the 2007 conference are instructive about the range of views regarding housing-\nrelated developments preceding the acute phase of the financial crisis. See Federal Reserve Bank of\nKansas City (2007), Housing, Housing Finance, and Monetary Policy, proceedings of an economic policy\nsymposium (Kansas City: FRBKC),\nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/publications/research/escp/symposiums/escp-2007.\n5 For a discussion of the correspondence between the steps taken by the Federal Reserve and those\nsuggested by Walter Bagehot in the 19th century, see Brian F.

The failure\nof Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is marked by the decision of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA)\nto place Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in government conservatorship on September 7, 2008. Links to\ndocuments outlining the actions taken around this time are available on the FHFA’s website at\nhttps://www.fhfa.gov/Media/PublicAffairs/Pages/Conservatorship-of-Fannie-Mae-and-Freddie-Mac.aspx.\n\n- 4 -\ncompared with the tidal wave that nearly wiped out the financial sector that September\nand led to a plunge in economic activity in the following months. Not long after Fannie\nand Freddie were placed in government conservatorship, Lehman Brothers collapsed,\nsetting off a week in which American International Group, Inc. (AIG), came to the brink\nof failure and required large loans from the Federal Reserve to mitigate the systemic\nfallout; a large money market fund “broke the buck” (that is, was unable to maintain a net\nasset value of $1 per share) and runs on other money funds accelerated, requiring the\nTreasury to provide a guarantee of money fund liabilities; global dollar funding markets\nnearly collapsed, necessitating coordinated action by central banks around the world; the\ntwo remaining large investment banks became bank holding companies, thereby ending\nthe era of large independent investment banks in the United States; and the Treasury\nproposed a rescue of the financial sector. Within several weeks, the Congress passed--\nand President Bush signed into law--the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008,\nwhich established the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program; the Federal Reserve\ninitiated further emergency lending programs; and the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (FDIC) guaranteed a broad range of bank debt.7 Facing similar challenges in\ntheir own jurisdictions, many foreign governments also undertook aggressive measures to\nsupport the functioning of credit markets, including large-scale capital injections into\nbanks, expansions of deposit insurance programs, and guarantees of some forms of bank\ndebt.\n7 In the fall of 2008, the three largest investment banks were (in alphabetical order) Goldman Sachs, Merrill\nLynch, and Morgan Stanley. Merrill Lynch agreed to be acquired by Bank of America, and the remaining\ntwo firms became bank holding companies.\n\n- 5 -\nDespite the forceful policy responses by the Treasury, the Congress, the FDIC,\nand the Federal Reserve as well as authorities abroad, the crisis continued to intensify:\nThe vulnerabilities in the U.S. and global economies had grown too large, and the\nsubsequent damage was enormous. From the beginning of 2008 to early 2010, nearly\n9 million jobs, on net, were lost in the United States. Millions of Americans lost their\nhomes. And distress was not limited to the U.S. economy: Global trade and economic\nactivity contracted to a degree that had not been seen since the 1930s. The economic\nrecovery that followed, despite extraordinary policy actions, was painfully slow.\nWhat the Crisis Revealed and How Policymakers Have Responded\nThese painful events renewed efforts to guard against financial instability. The\nCongress, the Administration, and regulatory agencies implemented new laws,\nregulations, and supervisory practices to limit the risk of another crisis, in coordination\nwith policymakers around the world.\nThe vulnerabilities within the financial system in the mid-2000s were numerous\nand, in hindsight, familiar from past financial panics. Financial institutions had assumed\ntoo much risk, especially related to the housing market, through mortgage lending\nstandards that were far too lax and contributed to substantial overborrowing. Repeating a\nfamiliar pattern, the “madness of crowds” had contributed to a bubble, in which investors\nand households expected rapid appreciation in house prices. The long period of\neconomic stability beginning in the 1980s had led to complacency about potential risks,\nand the buildup of risk was not widely recognized.8 As a result, market and supervisory\n8 The notion that popular sentiment may contribute to mispricing of assets--for example, the power of the\nmadness of crowds--is attributed to Charles Mackay (1841), Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions\nand the Madness of Crowds (London: Richard Bentley). A more modern perspective, and one using a\n\n- 6 -\ndiscipline was lacking, and financial institutions were allowed to take on high levels of\nleverage. This leverage was facilitated by short-term wholesale borrowing, owing in part\nto market-based vehicles, such as money market mutual funds and asset-backed\ncommercial paper programs that allowed the rapid expansion of liquidity transformation\noutside of the regulated depository sector. Finally, a self-reinforcing loop developed, in\nwhich all of the factors I have just cited intensified as investors sought ways to gain\nexposure to the rising prices of assets linked to housing and the financial sector. As a\nresult, securitization and the development of complex derivatives products distributed\nrisk across institutions in ways that were opaque and ultimately destabilizing.\nIn response, policymakers around the world have put in place measures to limit a\nfuture buildup of similar vulnerabilities. The United States, through coordinated\nregulatory action and legislation, moved very rapidly to begin reforming our financial\nsystem, and the speed with which our banking system returned to health provides\nevidence of the effectiveness of that strategy. Moreover, U.S. leadership of global efforts\nthrough bodies such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Financial\nStability Board (FSB), and the Group of Twenty has contributed to the development of\nstandards that promote financial stability around the world, thereby supporting global\ngrowth while protecting the U.S. financial system from adverse developments abroad.\nphrase as memorable as the madness of crowds, is provided by Robert J.

The notion that economic stability can\ngenerate a buildup of imbalances that subsequently contributes to instability is presented in Hyman P.\nMinsky (1974), “The Modeling of Financial Instability: An Introduction,” in Modeling and Simulation,\nVol. 5, Part 1, proceedings of the Fifth Annual Pittsburgh Conference (Pittsburgh: Instrument Society of\nAmerica), pp. 267-72, http://digitalcommons.bard.edu/hm_archive/467. A related discussion of how\nfinancial excesses often precede downturns (and even panics) is provided in Charles P. Kindleberger and\nRobert Z. Aliber (2005), Manias, Panics, and Crashes: A History of Financial Crises, 5th ed. (Hoboken,\nN.J.: John Wiley & Sons).\n\n- 7 -\nPreeminent among these domestic and global efforts have been steps to increase the loss-\nabsorbing capacity of banks, regulations to limit both maturity transformation in short-\nterm funding markets and liquidity mismatches within banks, and new authorities to\nfacilitate the resolution of large financial institutions and to subject systemically\nimportant firms to more stringent prudential regulation.\nSeveral important reforms have increased the loss-absorbing capacity of global\nbanks. First, the quantity and quality of capital required relative to risk-weighted assets\nhave been increased substantially.9 In addition, a simple leverage ratio provides a\nbackstop, reflecting the lesson imparted by past crises that risk weights are imperfect and\na minimum amount of equity capital should fund a firm’s total assets. Moreover, both\nthe risk-weighted and simple leverage requirements are higher for the largest, most\nsystemic firms, which lowers the risk of distress at such firms and encourages them to\nlimit activities that could threaten financial stability.10 Finally, the largest U.S. banks\nparticipate in the annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR)--the\n9 These improvements encompass a number of changes. The regulatory requirements for capital have been\nincreased and focus on Tier 1 common equity, which proved more capable of absorbing losses than lower-\nquality forms of capital. The role of bank internal models in determining risk-weighted assets also has\nbeen significantly constrained in the United States. In addition, exposures previously considered off\nbalance sheet have been incorporated into risk-weighted assets.\n10 The Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency adopted a final\nrule to strengthen the leverage ratio standards for the largest, most interconnected U.S. banking\norganizations on April 8, 2014. Under the final rule, covered bank holding companies must maintain a\nleverage buffer of 2 percentage points above the minimum supplementary leverage ratio requirement of\n3 percent, for a total of 5 percent, to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus\npayments (see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,\nand Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (2014), “Agencies Adopt Enhanced Supplementary\nLeverage Ratio Final Rule and Issue Supplementary Leverage Ratio Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,” joint\npress release, April 8, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20140408a.htm).\nThe Federal Reserve approved a final rule imposing risk-based capital surcharges on the largest, most\nsystemically important U.S. bank holding companies on July 20, 2015; in connection with the final rule, the\nBoard issued a white paper describing the calibration of the risk-based capital surcharges (see Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System (2015), “Federal Reserve Board Approves Final Rule Requiring\nthe Largest, Most Systemically Important U.S. Bank Holding Companies to Further Strengthen Their\nCapital Positions,” press release, July 20,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20150720a.htm).\n\n- 8 -\nstress tests. In addition to contributing to greater loss-absorbing capacity, the CCAR\nimproves public understanding of risks at large banking firms, provides a forward-\nlooking examination of firms’ potential losses during severely adverse economic\nconditions, and has contributed to significant improvements in risk management.\nReforms have also addressed the risks associated with maturity transformation.\nThe fragility created by deposit-like liabilities outside the traditional banking sector has\nbeen mitigated by regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission\naffecting prime institutional money market funds. These rules require these prime funds\nto use a floating net asset value, among other changes, a shift that has made these funds\nless attractive as cash-management vehicles. The changes at money funds have also\nhelped reduce banks’ reliance on unsecured short-term wholesale funding, since prime\ninstitutional funds were significant investors in those bank liabilities. Liquidity risk at\nlarge banks has been further mitigated by a new liquidity coverage ratio and a capital\nsurcharge for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). The liquidity coverage ratio\nrequires that banks hold liquid assets to cover potential net cash outflows over a 30-day\nstress period. The capital surcharge for U.S. G-SIBs links the required level of capital for\nthe largest banks to their reliance on short-term wholesale funding.11\nWhile improvements in capital and liquidity regulation will limit the reemergence\nof the risks that grew substantially in the mid-2000s, the failure of Lehman Brothers\ndemonstrated how the absence of an adequate resolution process for dealing with a\n11 Moreover, the Federal Reserve’s Comprehensive Liquidity Analysis and Review, in which supervisors\nanalyze the liquidity risks and practices at large banks, has promoted improvements in liquidity-risk\nmanagement. The U.S. banking agencies also have proposed a net stable funding ratio (NSFR) to help\nensure that large banks have a stable funding profile over a one-year horizon, and we are working toward\nfinalization of the NSFR.\n\n- 9 -\nfailing systemic firm left policymakers with only the terrible choices of a bailout or\nallowing a destabilizing collapse. In recognition of this shortcoming, the Congress\nadopted the orderly liquidation authority in Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) to provide an alternative\nresolution mechanism for systemically important firms to be used instead of bankruptcy\nproceedings when necessary to preserve financial stability. The orderly liquidation\nauthority contains a number of tools, including liquidity resources and temporary stays on\nthe termination of financial contracts, that would help protect the financial system and\neconomy from the severe adverse spillovers that could occur if a systemic firm failed.\nImportantly, any losses incurred by the government in an Orderly Liquidation Authority\nresolution would not be at the expense of taxpayers, since the statute provides that all\nsuch losses must be borne by other large financial firms through subsequent assessments.\nIn addition, the Congress required that the largest banks submit living wills that describe\nhow they could be resolved under bankruptcy.12 And the Federal Reserve has mandated\nthat systemically important banks meet total loss-absorbing capacity requirements, which\nrequire these firms to maintain long-term debt adequate to absorb losses and recapitalize\nthe firm in resolution. These enhancements in resolvability protect financial stability and\nhelp ensure that the shareholders and creditors of failing firms bear losses. Moreover,\nthese steps promote market discipline, as creditors--knowing full well that they will bear\n12 In addition to these steps, the Board issued another proposal to make G-SIBs more resolvable in May of\nlast year (see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2016), “Federal Reserve Board Proposes\nRule to Support U.S. Financial Stability by Enhancing the Resolvability of Very Large and Complex\nFinancial Firms,” press release, May 3,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20160503b.htm). This proposed rule would\nimpose restrictions on G-SIBs’ qualified financial contracts--including derivatives and repurchase\nagreements (or repos)--to guard against the rapid, mass unwinding of those contracts during the resolution\nof a G-SIB. The proposed restrictions are a key step toward G-SIB resolvability because rapidly unwinding\nthese contracts could destabilize the financial system by causing asset fire sales and toppling other firms.\n\n- 10 -\nlosses in the event of distress--demand prudent risk-taking, thereby limiting the problem\nof too-big-to-fail.\nFinancial stability risks can also grow large outside the regulated banking sector,\nas amply demonstrated by the events of 2007 and 2008. In response, a number of\nregulatory changes affecting what is commonly referred to as the shadow banking sector\nhave been instituted. A specific example of such risks, illustrative of broader\ndevelopments, was the buildup of large counterparty exposures through derivatives\nbetween market participants and AIG that were both inappropriately risk-managed and\nopaque. To mitigate the potential for such risks to arise again, new standards require\ncentral clearing of standardized over-the-counter derivatives, enhanced reporting\nrequirements for all derivatives, and higher capital as well as margin requirements for\nnoncentrally cleared derivatives transactions.13\nAnother important step was the Congress’s creation of the Financial Stability\nOversight Council (FSOC). The council is responsible for identifying risks to financial\nstability and for designating those financial institutions that are systemically important\nand thus subject to prudential regulation by the Federal Reserve. Both of these\nresponsibilities are important to help guard against the risk that vulnerabilities outside the\nexisting regulatory perimeter grow to levels that jeopardize financial stability.14\n13 One area in which regulations have shifted to a lesser degree in the United States is that of time-varying\nmacroprudential tools, in which regulatory requirements are adjusted to address changes in vulnerabilities\nthat may affect the financial system. For example, U.S. regulatory authorities have adopted rules that allow\nuse of the countercyclical capital buffer, but other time-varying tools are limited in the United States. This\nissue is discussed in, for example, Stanley Fischer (2015), “Macroprudential Policy in the U.S. Economy,”\nspeech delivered at “Macroprudential Monetary Policy,” 59th Economic Conference of the Federal Reserve\nBank of Boston, Boston, October 2,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/fischer20151002a.htm.\n14 For example, the FSOC contributed, through its identification process, to the development of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission reforms affecting money market funds. The FSOC has also\n\n- 11 -\nThe Financial System Is Safer\nThe evidence shows that reforms since the crisis have made the financial system\nsubstantially safer. Loss-absorbing capacity among the largest banks is significantly\nhigher, with Tier 1 common equity capital more than doubling from early 2009 to now.15\nThe annual stress-testing exercises in recent years have led to improvements in the capital\npositions and risk-management processes among participating banks. Large banks have\ncut their reliance on short-term wholesale funding essentially in half and hold\nsignificantly more high-quality, liquid assets. Assets under management at prime\ninstitutional money market funds that proved susceptible to runs in the crisis have\ndecreased substantially. And the ability of regulators to resolve a large institution has\nimproved, reflecting both new authorities and tangible steps taken by institutions to\nadjust their organizational and capital structure in a manner that enhances their\nresolvability and significantly reduces the problem of too-big-to-fail.\nThe progress evident in regulatory and supervisory metrics has been accompanied\nby shifts in private-sector assessments that also suggest enhanced financial stability.\nInvestors have recognized the progress achieved toward ending too-big-to-fail, and\nseveral rating agencies have removed the government support rating uplift that they once\naccorded to the largest banks. Credit default swaps for the large banks also suggest that\ndesignated four firms as systemically important--AIG, GE Capital, Prudential, and MetLife. GE Capital\nchose to shrink, adjust its business model, and reduce its footprint in short-term wholesale funding\nmarkets--and hence reduce a source of systemic risk. These actions caused the FSOC to subsequently\nremove its designation as systemically important last year--illustrating how the designation process allows\nboth identifying systemic firms and removing such designations when appropriate.\n15 The increase in Tier 1 common equity among bank holding companies has been sizable, especially for\nthe largest banks. If the largest banks are defined as either the eight U.S. global systemically important\nbanks or the U.S. bank holding companies that participated in the CCAR in 2017 (and for which data are\navailable for 2009:Q1), Tier 1 common equity has more than doubled in dollar terms and relative to risk-\nweighted assets from the first quarter of 2009 to the most recent observations.\n\n- 12 -\nmarket participants assign a low probability to the distress of a large U.S. banking firm.\nMarket-based assessments of the loss-absorbing capacity of large U.S. banks have moved\nup in recent years, and market-based measures of equity now lie in the range of book\nestimates of equity. To be sure, market-based measures may not reflect true risks--they\ncertainly did not in the mid-2000s--and hence the observed improvements should not be\noveremphasized.16 But supervisory metrics are not perfect, either, and policymakers and\ninvestors should continue to monitor a range of supervisory and market-based indicators\nof financial system resilience.\nEconomic research provides further support for the notion that reforms have made\nthe system safer. Studies have demonstrated that higher levels of bank capital mitigate\nthe risk and adverse effects of financial crises.17 Moreover, researchers have highlighted\nhow liquidity regulation supports financial stability by complementing capital\n16 For example, Natasha Sarin and Lawrence Summers have reviewed market-based measures of bank\nequity and related measures of bank risks and concluded that such measures have not improved since the\nmid-2000s. This assessment may understate the improvement in fundamental risk within the banking\nsector, as it takes the elevated valuations and low assessment of default risk implied by market prices\nduring the earlier period as indicative of fundamentals. Despite these shortcomings, their analysis is a\nuseful reminder of the importance of considering both regulatory metrics and assessments implied by\nmarket prices. See Natasha Sarin and Lawrence H. Summers (2016), “Understanding Bank Risk through\nMarket Measures,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Fall, pp. 57-109,\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/sarintextfall16bpea.pdf.\n17 For example, see the review of evidence in Simon Firestone, Amy Lorenc, and Ben Ranish (2017), “An\nEmpirical Economic Assessment of the Costs and Benefits of Bank Capital in the US,” Finance and\nEconomics Discussion Series 2017-034 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,\nApril), https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2017034pap.pdf. Some research is less\nsupportive of the role of bank capital in limiting the risk of financial crises but suggests that higher levels of\nbank capital limit the economic costs of a financial crisis (for example, Òscar Jordà, Björn Richter, Moritz\nSchularick, and Alan M. Taylor (2017), “Bank Capital Redux: Solvency, Liquidity, and Crisis,” NBER\nWorking Paper Series 23287 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, March)). Some\nof the differences in findings across studies may be due to the degree to which the studies incorporate data\nfrom different countries and over different periods, as researchers disagree over the extent to which\ncomparisons across countries or periods appropriately account for other factors that differ across such\ndimensions.\n\n- 13 -\nregulation.18 Economic models of the resilience of the financial sector--so called top-\ndown stress-testing models--reinforce the message from supervisory stress tests that the\nriskiness of large banks has diminished over the past decade.19 Similarly, model-based\nanalyses indicate that the risk of adverse fire sale spillovers across banks or broker-\ndealers have been substantially mitigated.20\nIs This Safer System Supporting Growth?\nI suspect many in this audience would agree with the narrative of my remarks so\nfar: The events of the crisis demanded action, needed reforms were implemented, and\nthese reforms have made the system safer. Now--a decade from the onset of the crisis\nand nearly seven years since the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act and international\nagreement on the key banking reforms--a new question is being asked: Have reforms\ngone too far, resulting in a financial system that is too burdened to support prudent risk-\ntaking and economic growth?\nThe Federal Reserve is committed individually, and in coordination with other\nU.S. government agencies through forums such as the FSOC and internationally through\nbodies such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the FSB, to evaluating\n18 For example, Charles A.E. Goodhart, Anil K. Kashyap, Dimitrios P. Tsomocos, and Alexandros P.\nVardoulakis (2013), “An Integrated Framework for Analyzing Multiple Financial Regulations,”\nInternational Journal of Central Banking, supp. 1, vol. 9 (January), pp. 109-43; and Gazi I. Kara and S.\nMehmet Ozsoy (2016), “Bank Regulation under Fire Sale Externalities,” Finance and Economics\nDiscussion Series 2016-026 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, April),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2016/files/2016026pap.pdf.\n19 For example, researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York have developed a top-down stress-\ntesting model, and simulation results from the model suggest that the resilience of the U.S. banking system\nhas improved since the crisis; see Beverly Hirtle, Anna Kovner, James Vickery, and Meru Bhanot (2014),\n“Assessing Financial Stability: The Capital and Loss Assessment under Stress Scenarios (CLASS)\nModel,” Staff Report 663 (New York: Federal Reserve Bank of New York, February; revised July 2015),\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr663.pdf.\n20 For example, see Fernando Duarte and Thomas Eisenbach (2013), “Fire-Sale Spillovers and Systemic\nRisk,” Staff Report 645 (New York: Federal Reserve Bank of New York, October; revised February 2015),\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr645.pdf.\n\n- 14 -\nthe effects of financial market regulations and considering appropriate adjustments.\nFurthermore, the Federal Reserve has independently taken steps to evaluate potential\nadjustments to its regulatory and supervisory practices. For example, the Federal Reserve\ninitiated a review of its stress tests following the 2015 cycle, and this review suggested\nchanges to reduce the burden on participating institutions, especially smaller institutions,\nand to better align the supervisory stress tests with regulatory capital requirements.21 In\naddition, a broader set of changes to the new financial regulatory framework may deserve\nconsideration. Such changes include adjustments that may simplify regulations applying\nto small and medium-sized banks and enhance resolution planning.22\nMore broadly, we continue to monitor economic conditions, and to review and\nconduct research, to better understand the effect of regulatory reforms and possible\nimplications for regulation. I will briefly summarize the current state of play in two\nareas: the effect of regulation on credit availability and on changes in market liquidity.\n21 In response to the Federal Reserve’s review and other information, the Board finalized a rule adjusting its\ncapital plan and stress-testing rules, effective for the 2017 cycle, on January 30, 2017. The final rule\nremoves large and noncomplex firms from the qualitative assessment of the Federal Reserve’s CCAR,\nreducing significant burden on these firms and focusing the qualitative review in CCAR on the largest,\nmost complex financial institutions. More generally, changes to improve regulatory and supervisory\npractices related to stress testing by reducing unnecessary burden while preserving resilience are under\nconsideration. Possible changes have been discussed in Daniel K. Tarullo (2016), “Next Steps in the\nEvolution of Stress Testing,” speech delivered at the Yale University School of Management Leaders\nForum, New Haven, Conn., September 26,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/tarullo20160926a.htm.\n22 An overview of a set of principles that may guide such adjustments is discussed by Jerome H. Powell\n(2017), “Relationship between Regulation and Economic Growth,” statement before the Committee on\nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, June 22,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/powell20170622a.htm. In addition, the Federal\nReserve Board has continued to engage in international efforts to assess the effects of reforms and possible\nadjustments; in this context, the FSB has developed a framework for the post-implementation evaluation of\nthe effects of the Group of Twenty financial regulatory reforms; see Financial Stability Board (2017),\nFramework for Post-Implementation Evaluation of the Effects of the G20 Financial Regulatory Reforms\n(Basel, Switzerland: FSB, July), www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P030717-4.pdf.\n\n- 15 -\nThe effects of capital regulation on credit availability have been investigated\nextensively. Some studies suggest that higher capital weighs on banks’ lending, while\nothers suggest that higher capital supports lending.23 Such conflicting results in academic\nresearch are not altogether surprising. It is difficult to identify the effects of regulatory\ncapital requirements on lending because material changes to capital requirements are rare\nand are often precipitated, as in the recent case, by financial crises that also have large\neffects on lending.\nGiven the uncertainty regarding the effect of capital regulation on lending,\nrulemakings of the Federal Reserve and other agencies were informed by analyses that\nbalanced the possible stability gains from greater loss-absorbing capacity against the\npossible adverse effects on lending and economic growth.24 This ex ante assessment\npointed to sizable net benefits to economic growth from higher capital standards--and\nsubsequent research supports this assessment.25 The steps to improve the capital\n23 The related literature is sizable. An early contribution is Ben S. Bernanke and Cara S. Lown (1991),\n“The Credit Crunch,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, no. 2, pp. 205-47. Research finding a\nsizable negative relationship between capital requirements and lending includes Shekhar Aiyar, Charles W.\nCalomiris, and Tomasz Wieladek (2014), “Does Macro-Prudential Regulation Leak? Evidence from a UK\nPolicy Experiment,” Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, vol. 46 (s1; February), pp. 181-214. Research\nfinding little relationship between lending and capital ratios (outside financial crises) includes Mark\nCarlson, Hui Shan, and Missaka Warusawitharana (2013), “Capital Ratios and Bank Lending: A Matched\nBank Approach,” Journal of Financial Intermediation, vol. 22 (October), pp. 663-87. Research suggesting\nthat higher capital levels may increase lending includes Leonardo Gambacorta and Hyun Song Shin (2016),\n“Why Bank Capital Matters for Monetary Policy,” BIS Working Papers 558 (Basel, Switzerland: Bank for\nInternational Settlements, April), www.bis.org/publ/work558.pdf.\n24 For example, see Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2010), An Assessment of the Long-Term\nEconomic Impact of Stronger Capital and Liquidity Requirements (Basel, Switzerland: BCBS, August),\nwww.bis.org/publ/bcbs173.pdf; and Macroeconomic Assessment Group (2010), Interim Report: Assessing\nthe Macroeconomic Impact of the Transition to Stronger Capital and Liquidity Requirements (Basel,\nSwitzerland: MAG, August), www.bis.org/publ/othp10.pdf.\n25 The ex ante studies from the Basel Committee and the Macroeconomic Assessment Group referenced in\nnote 24 pointed to sizable net benefits from higher capital requirements. More academic research pointing\nto similar conclusions using macroeconomic models (and typically focused on model-specific measures of\neconomic welfare) includes Michael T. Kiley and Jae W. Sim (2014), “Bank Capital and the\nMacroeconomy: Policy Considerations,” Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, vol. 43 (June),\npp. 175-98; Laurent Clerc, Alexis Derviz, Caterina Mendicino, Stephane Moyen, Kalin Nikolov, Livio\n\n- 16 -\npositions of banks promptly and significantly following the crisis, beginning with the\n2009 Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, have resulted in a return of lending\ngrowth and profitability among U.S. banks more quickly than among their global peers.\nWhile material adverse effects of capital regulation on broad measures of lending\nare not readily apparent, credit may be less available to some borrowers, especially\nhomebuyers with less-than-perfect credit histories and, perhaps, small businesses. In\nretrospect, mortgage borrowing was clearly too easy for some households in the mid-\n2000s, resulting in debt burdens that were unsustainable and ultimately damaging to the\nfinancial system. Currently, many factors are likely affecting mortgage lending,\nincluding changes in market perceptions of the risk associated with mortgage lending;\nchanges in practices at the government-sponsored enterprises and the Federal Housing\nAdministration; changes in technology that may be contributing to entry by nonbank\nlenders; changes in consumer protection regulations; and, perhaps to a limited degree,\nchanges in capital and liquidity regulations within the banking sector. These issues are\ncomplex and interact with a broader set of challenges related to the domestic housing\nfinance system.\nStracca, Javier Suarez, and Alexandros P. Vardoulakis (2015), “Capital Regulation in a Macroeconomic\nModel with Three Layers of Default,” International Journal of Central Banking, vol. 11 (June), pages 9-63;\nand Juliane Begenau (2016), “Capital Requirements, Risk Choice, and Liquidity Provision in a Business\nCycle Model,” unpublished paper, Harvard Business School, September. Subsequent analyses, albeit ones\nthat follow similar approaches, also suggest that there are net benefits to higher capital standards. One\nexample is the analysis by Firestone, Lorenc, and Ranish, “An Empirical Economic Assessment,” in\nnote 17. Another is Ingo Fender and Ulf Lewrick (2016), “Adding It All Up: The Macroeconomic Impact\nof Basel III and Outstanding Reform Issues,” BIS Working Papers 591 (Basel, Switzerland: Bank for\nInternational Settlements, November), www.bis.org/publ/work591.pdf. Indeed, this research points to\nbenefits from capital requirements in excess of those adopted, a conclusion also reached in Wayne\nPassmore and Alexander H. von Hafften (2017), “Are Basel’s Capital Surcharges for Global Systemically\nImportant Banks Too Small?” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2017-021 (Washington: Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System, February),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2017/files/2017021pap.pdf.\n\n- 17 -\nCredit appears broadly available to small businesses with solid credit histories,\nalthough indicators point to some difficulties facing firms with weak credit scores and\ninsufficient credit histories.26 Small business formation is critical to economic dynamism\nand growth. Smaller firms rely disproportionately on lending from smaller banks, and\nthe Federal Reserve has been taking steps and examining additional steps to reduce\nunnecessary complexity in regulations affecting smaller banks.27\nFinally, many financial market participants have expressed concerns about the\nability to transact in volume at low cost--that is, about market liquidity, particularly in\ncertain fixed-income markets such as that for corporate bonds. Market liquidity for\ncorporate bonds remains robust overall, and the healthy condition of the market is\napparent in low bid-ask spreads and the large volume of corporate bond issuance in\nrecent years. That said, liquidity conditions are clearly evolving. Large dealers appear to\ndevote less of their balance sheets to holding inventories of securities to facilitate trades\nand instead increasingly facilitate trades by directly matching buyers and sellers. In\n26 This conclusion is consistent with, for example, the findings in Federal Reserve Banks (2017), 2016\nSmall Business Credit Survey: Report on Employer Firms (New York: Federal Reserve Bank of New\nYork, April), https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/smallbusiness/2016/SBCS-Report-\nEmployerFirms-2016.pdf.\n27 As I have discussed previously, the Federal Reserve has been considering improvements through a\nnumber of work streams. For example, the Federal Reserve and the other banking agencies have recently\ncompleted the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA) review. Under\nEGRPRA, the federal banking agencies are required to conduct a joint review of their regulations every\n10 years to identify provisions that are outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome. The Federal Reserve\nviewed this review as a timely opportunity to step back and identify ways to reduce regulatory burden,\nparticularly for smaller or less complex banks that pose less risk to the U.S. financial system. I discussed\npreliminary emerging themes from this review in Janet L. Yellen (2016), “Supervision and Regulation,”\nstatement before the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, September 28,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/yellen20160928a.htm. For the final EGRPRA\nreport to the Congress, see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Office of the Comptroller of\nthe Currency, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and National Credit Union Administration (2017),\nJoint Report to Congress: Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (Washington:\nFederal Financial Institutions Examination Council, March),\nhttps://www.ffiec.gov/pdf/2017_FFIEC_EGRPRA_Joint-Report_to_Congress.pdf.\n\n- 18 -\naddition, algorithmic traders and institutional investors are a larger presence in various\nmarkets than previously, and the willingness of these institutions to support liquidity in\nstressful conditions is uncertain. While no single factor appears to be the predominant\ncause of the evolution of market liquidity, some regulations may be affecting market\nliquidity somewhat. There may be benefits to simplifying aspects of the Volcker rule,\nwhich limits proprietary trading by banking firms, and to reviewing the interaction of the\nenhanced supplementary leverage ratio with risk-based capital requirements. At the same\ntime, the new regulatory framework overall has made dealers more resilient to shocks,\nand, in the past, distress at dealers following adverse shocks has been an important factor\ndriving market illiquidity. As a result, any adjustments to the regulatory framework\nshould be modest and preserve the increase in resilience at large dealers and banks\nassociated with the reforms put in place in recent years.\nRemaining Challenges\nSo where do we stand a decade after the onset of the most severe financial crisis\nsince the Great Depression? Substantial progress has been made toward the Federal\nReserve’s economic objectives of maximum employment and price stability, in putting in\nplace a regulatory and supervisory structure that is well designed to lower the risks to\nfinancial stability, and in actually achieving a stronger financial system. Our more\nresilient financial system is better prepared to absorb, rather than amplify, adverse\nshocks, as has been illustrated during periods of market turbulence in recent years.\nEnhanced resilience supports the ability of banks and other financial institutions to lend,\nthereby supporting economic growth through good times and bad.\n\n- 19 -\nNonetheless, there is more work to do. The balance of research suggests that the\ncore reforms we have put in place have substantially boosted resilience without unduly\nlimiting credit availability or economic growth. But many reforms have been\nimplemented only fairly recently, markets continue to adjust, and research remains\nlimited. The Federal Reserve is committed to evaluating where reforms are working and\nwhere improvements are needed to most efficiently maintain a resilient financial system.\nMoreover, I expect that the evolution of the financial system in response to global\neconomic forces, technology, and, yes, regulation will result sooner or later in the all-too-\nfamiliar risks of excessive optimism, leverage, and maturity transformation reemerging in\nnew ways that require policy responses. We relearned this lesson through the pain\ninflicted by the crisis. We can never be sure that new crises will not occur, but if we keep\nthis lesson fresh in our memories--along with the painful cost that was exacted by the\nrecent crisis--and act accordingly, we have reason to hope that the financial system and\neconomy will experience fewer crises and recover from any future crisis more quickly,\nsparing households and businesses some of the pain they endured during the crisis that\nstruck a decade ago.",

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Economic Symposium\nJackson Hole, Wyoming\nAugust 22, 2014\n\nIn the five years since the end of the Great Recession, the economy has made\nconsiderable progress in recovering from the largest and most sustained loss of\nemployment in the United States since the Great Depression.1 More jobs have now been\ncreated in the recovery than were lost in the downturn, with payroll employment in May\nof this year finally exceeding the previous peak in January 2008. Job gains in 2014 have\naveraged 230,000 a month, up from the 190,000 a month pace during the preceding two\nyears. The unemployment rate, at 6.2 percent in July, has declined nearly 4 percentage\npoints from its late 2009 peak. Over the past year, the unemployment rate has fallen\nconsiderably, and at a surprisingly rapid pace. These developments are encouraging, but\nit speaks to the depth of the damage that, five years after the end of the recession, the\nlabor market has yet to fully recover.\nThe Federal Reserve’s monetary policy objective is to foster maximum\nemployment and price stability. In this regard, a key challenge is to assess just how far\nthe economy now stands from the attainment of its maximum employment goal.\nJudgments concerning the size of that gap are complicated by ongoing shifts in the\nstructure of the labor market and the possibility that the severe recession caused\npersistent changes in the labor market’s functioning.\nThese and other questions about the labor market are central to the conduct of\nmonetary policy, so I am pleased that the organizers of this year’s symposium chose\nlabor market dynamics as its theme. My colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) and I look to the presentations and discussions over the next two\ndays for insights into possible changes that are affecting the labor market. I expect,\n1 Nonfarm employment contracted by 6.3 percent from its peak in 2008 to its trough in early 2010,\ncompared with a 5.2 percent loss in the 1948-49 recession, previously the largest since the 1930s.\n\n- 2 -\nhowever, that our understanding of labor market developments and their potential\nimplications for inflation will remain far from perfect. As a consequence, monetary\npolicy ultimately must be conducted in a pragmatic manner that relies not on any\nparticular indicator or model, but instead reflects an ongoing assessment of a wide range\nof information in the context of our ever-evolving understanding of the economy.\nThe Labor Market Recovery and Monetary Policy\nIn my remarks this morning, I will review a number of developments related to\nthe functioning of the labor market that have made it more difficult to judge the\nremaining degree of slack. Differing interpretations of these developments affect\njudgments concerning the appropriate path of monetary policy. Before turning to the\nspecifics, however, I would like to provide some context concerning the role of the labor\nmarket in shaping monetary policy over the past several years. During that time, the\nFOMC has maintained a highly accommodative monetary policy in pursuit of its\ncongressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and stable prices. The\nCommittee judged such a stance appropriate because inflation has fallen short of our\n2 percent objective while the labor market, until recently, operated very far from any\nreasonable definition of maximum employment.\nThe FOMC’s current program of asset purchases began when the unemployment\nrate stood at 8.1 percent and progress in lowering it was expected to be much slower than\ndesired. The Committee’s objective was to achieve a substantial improvement in the\noutlook for the labor market, and as progress toward this goal has materialized, we have\nreduced our pace of asset purchases and expect to complete this program in October. In\naddition, in December 2012, the Committee modified its forward guidance for the federal\n\n- 3 -\nfunds rate, stating that “as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent,\ninflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half\npercentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term\ninflation expectations continue to be well anchored,” the Committee would not even\nconsider raising the federal funds rate above the 0 to 1/4 percent range.2 This “threshold\nbased” forward guidance was deemed appropriate under conditions in which inflation\nwas subdued and the economy remained unambiguously far from maximum employment.\nEarlier this year, however, with the unemployment rate declining faster than had\nbeen anticipated and nearing the 6-1/2 percent threshold, the FOMC recast its forward\nguidance, stating that “in determining how long to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent\ntarget range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would assess progress--both\nrealized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent\ninflation.”3 As the recovery progresses, assessments of the degree of remaining slack in\nthe labor market need to become more nuanced because of considerable uncertainty about\nthe level of employment consistent with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate. Indeed, in\nits 2012 statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy, the FOMC\nexplicitly recognized that factors determining maximum employment “may change over\ntime and may not be directly measurable,” and that assessments of the level of maximum\nemployment “are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision.”4 Accordingly, the\n2 See paragraph 5 in Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012), “Federal Reserve Issues\nFOMC Statement,” press release, December 12,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20121212a.htm.\n3 See paragraph 5 in Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2014), “Federal Reserve Issues\nFOMC Statement,” press release, March 19,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140319a.htm.\n4 See paragraph 5 in Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012), “Federal Reserve Issues\nFOMC Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Policy Strategy,” press release, January 25,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20120125c.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nreformulated forward guidance reaffirms the FOMC’s view that policy decisions will not\nbe based on any single indicator, but will instead take into account a wide range of\ninformation on the labor market, as well as inflation and financial developments.5\nInterpreting Labor Market Surprises: Past and Future\nThe assessment of labor market slack is rarely simple and has been especially\nchallenging recently. Estimates of slack necessitate difficult judgments about the\nmagnitudes of the cyclical and structural influences affecting labor market variables,\nincluding labor force participation, the extent of part-time employment for economic\nreasons, and labor market flows, such as the pace of hires and quits. A considerable body\nof research suggests that the behavior of these and other labor market variables has\nchanged since the Great Recession.6 Along with cyclical influences, significant structural\nfactors have affected the labor market, including the aging of the workforce and other\ndemographic trends, possible changes in the underlying degree of dynamism in the labor\nmarket, and the phenomenon of “polarization”--that is, the reduction in the relative\nnumber of middle-skill jobs.7\n5 The central role of labor market conditions in monetary policy deliberations has also been apparent\nabroad. Last year the Bank of England announced its intention not to raise its policy rate at least until the\nunemployment rate reached 7 percent, subject to conditions on inflation and financial stability. Since that\ntime, the unemployment rate in the United Kingdom has dropped unexpectedly rapidly, prompting\npolicymakers to consider data beyond this single indicator when assessing the extent of spare capacity in\nthe U.K. economy. As in the United States, an unexpectedly swift decline in unemployment has raised\nquestions about the structural and cyclical effects of a severe recession.\n6 For a discussion of important differences in the evolution of labor market conditions during the Great\nRecession relative to typical postwar patterns, see Henry S. Farber (2011), “Job Loss in the Great\nRecession: Historical Perspective from the Displaced Workers Survey, 1984-2010,” NBER Working Paper\nSeries 17040 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, May).\n7 For convenience, the analysis here is presented as if cyclical factors and structural factors can be neatly\ndelineated. In reality, the line between the two may be indistinct. Moreover, what begins as cyclical\nweakness may evolve into structural damage. For a discussion of the strategic issues that arise when\npolicymakers believe such evolution from cyclical to structural to be an important feature of the economy,\nsee Dave Reifschneider, William Wascher, and David Wilcox (2013), “Aggregate Supply in the United\nStates: Recent Developments and Implications for the Conduct of Monetary Policy,” Finance and\nEconomics Discussion Series 2013-77 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,\nNovember), www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2013/201377/201377abs.html.\n\n- 5 -\nConsider first the behavior of the labor force participation rate, which has\ndeclined substantially since the end of the recession even as the unemployment rate has\nfallen. As a consequence, the employment-to-population ratio has increased far less over\nthe past several years than the unemployment rate alone would indicate, based on past\nexperience. For policymakers, the key question is: What portion of the decline in labor\nforce participation reflects structural shifts and what portion reflects cyclical weakness in\nthe labor market? If the cyclical component is abnormally large, relative to the\nunemployment rate, then it might be seen as an additional contributor to labor market\nslack.\nLabor force participation peaked in early 2000, so its decline began well before\nthe Great Recession. A portion of that decline clearly relates to the aging of the baby\nboom generation. But the pace of decline accelerated with the recession. As an\naccounting matter, the drop in the participation rate since 2008 can be attributed to\nincreases in four factors: retirement, disability, school enrollment, and other reasons,\nincluding worker discouragement.8 Of these, greater worker discouragement is most\ndirectly the result of a weak labor market, so we could reasonably expect further\nincreases in labor demand to pull a sizable share of discouraged workers back into the\nworkforce. Indeed, the flattening out of the labor force participation rate since late last\nyear could partly reflect discouraged workers rejoining the labor force in response to the\nsignificant improvements that we have seen in labor market conditions. If so, the cyclical\nshortfall in labor force participation may have diminished.\n8 See Shigeru Fujita (2014), “On the Causes of Declines in the Labor Force Participation Rate,” Federal\nReserve Bank of Philadelphia, Research Rap, special report, February 6,\nhttp://philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/publications/research-rap/2013/on-the-causes-of-declines-in-\nthe-labor-force-participation-rate.pdf.\n\n- 6 -\nWhat is more difficult to determine is whether some portion of the increase in\ndisability rates, retirements, and school enrollments since the Great Recession reflects\ncyclical forces. While structural factors have clearly and importantly affected each of\nthese three trends, some portion of the decline in labor force participation resulting from\nthese trends could be related to the recession and slow recovery and therefore might\nreverse in a stronger labor market.9 Disability applications and educational enrollments\ntypically are affected by cyclical factors, and existing evidence suggests that the elevated\nlevels of both may partly reflect perceptions of poor job prospects.10 Moreover, the rapid\npace of retirements over the past few years might reflect some degree of pull-forward of\nfuture retirements in the face of a weak labor market. If so, retirements might contribute\n9 On disability, see Mark Duggan and Scott A. Imberman (2009), “Why Are the Disability Rolls\nSkyrocketing?

At nearly 5 percent of the labor force, the number of\nsuch workers is notably larger, relative to the unemployment rate, than has been typical\nhistorically, providing another reason why the current level of the unemployment rate\nmay understate the amount of remaining slack in the labor market. Again, however,\nsome portion of the rise in involuntary part-time work may reflect structural rather than\ncyclical factors. For example, the ongoing shift in employment away from goods\nproduction and toward services, a sector which historically has used a greater portion of\npart-time workers, may be boosting the share of part-time jobs. Likewise, the continuing\ndecline of middle-skill jobs, some of which could be replaced by part-time jobs, may\nraise the share of part-time jobs in overall employment.12 Despite these challenges in\nassessing where the share of those employed part time for economic reasons may settle in\n11 The effects of the Great Recession on retirements are difficult to identify. During the recession and\nimmediately after, the losses in wealth may have put upward pressure on labor force participation; the\npersistently weak labor market may have subsequently contributed to more retirements and thus put\ndownward pressure on participation. Perhaps as a result of these confounding forces, early research on the\neffects of the Great Recession on retirement finds unclear results. For example, see Alan L. Gustman,\nThomas L. Steinmeier, and Nahid Tabatabai (2011), “How Did the Recession of 2007-2009 Affect the\nWealth and Retirement of the Near Retirement Age Population in the Health and Retirement Study?”\nNBER Working Paper Series 17547 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research,\nOctober). For a discussion of these developments, see Richard W. Johnson (2012), “Older Workers,\nRetirement, and the Great Recession” (Stanford, Calif.: Russell Sage Foundation and the Stanford Center\non Poverty and Inequality, October), http://web.stanford.edu/group/recessiontrends/cgi-\nbin/web/sites/all/themes/barron/pdf/Retirement_fact_sheet.pdf.\n12 See Tomaz Cajner, Dennis Mawhirter, Christopher Nekarda, and David Ratner (2014), “Why Is\nInvoluntary Part-Time Work Elevated?” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System, April 14), www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/notes/feds-notes/2014/why-is-\ninvoluntary-part-time-work-elevated-20140414.html; and Murat Tasci and Jessica Ice (2014), “Job\nPolarization and the Great Recession,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Economic Trends (May 28),\nwww.clevelandfed.org/research/trends/2014/0614/01labmar.cfm?WT.oss=murat tasci&WT.oss_r=380.\n\n- 8 -\nthe long run, the sharp run-up in involuntary part-time employment during the recession\nand its slow decline thereafter suggest that cyclical factors are significant.\nPrivate sector labor market flows provide additional indications of the strength of\nthe labor market. For example, the quits rate has tended to be pro-cyclical, since more\nworkers voluntarily quit their jobs when they are more confident about their ability to\nfind new ones and when firms are competing more actively for new hires. Indeed, the\nquits rate has picked up with improvements in the labor market over the past year, but it\nstill remains somewhat depressed relative to its level before the recession. A significant\nincrease in job openings over the past year suggests notable improvement in labor market\nconditions, but the hiring rate has only partially recovered from its decline during the\nrecession. Given the rise in job vacancies, hiring may be poised to pick up, but the\nfailure of hiring to rise with vacancies could also indicate that firms perceive the\nprospects for economic growth as still insufficient to justify adding to payrolls.\nAlternatively, subdued hiring could indicate that firms are encountering difficulties in\nfinding qualified job applicants. As is true of the other indicators I have discussed, labor\nmarket flows tend to reflect not only cyclical but also structural changes in the economy.\nIndeed, these flows may provide evidence of reduced labor market dynamism, which\ncould prove quite persistent.13 That said, the balance of evidence leads me to conclude\n13 For an analysis documenting declines in the rates of hiring, layoffs, and quits, along with lower job\ncreation and destruction, see Steven J. Davis, R. Jason Faberman, and John Haltiwanger (2012), “Labor\nMarket Flows in the Cross Section and over Time,” Journal of Monetary Economics, vol. 59 (January),\npp. 1-18. For a review of a range of evidence and possible explanations, see Henry R. Hyatt and James R.\nSpletzer (2013), “The Recent Decline in Employment Dynamics,” IZA Discussion Paper Series 7231\n(Bonn, Germany: Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA), February), http://ftp.iza.org/dp7231.pdf. These\nauthors suggest that much additional work is needed to understand the role of different factors in changes in\nlabor market dynamism. For an analysis that raises the possibility that some of these shifts reflect better\njob matches, see Raven Molloy, Christopher L. Smith, and Abigail K. Wozniak (2014), “Declining\nMigration within the U.S.: The Role of the Labor Market,” NBER Working Paper Series 20065\n(Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, April).\n\n- 9 -\nthat weak aggregate demand has contributed significantly to the depressed levels of quits\nand hires during the recession and in the recovery.\nOne convenient way to summarize the information contained in a large number of\nindicators is through the use of so-called factor models. Following this methodology,\nFederal Reserve Board staff developed a labor market conditions index from 19 labor\nmarket indicators, including four I just discussed.14 This broadly based metric supports\nthe conclusion that the labor market has improved significantly over the past year, but it\nalso suggests that the decline in the unemployment rate over this period somewhat\noverstates the improvement in overall labor market conditions.\nFinally, changes in labor compensation may also help shed light on the degree of\nlabor market slack, although here, too, there are significant challenges in distinguishing\nbetween cyclical and structural influences. Over the past several years, wage inflation, as\nmeasured by several different indexes, has averaged about 2 percent, and there has been\nlittle evidence of any broad-based acceleration in either wages or compensation. Indeed,\nin real terms, wages have been about flat, growing less than labor productivity. This\npattern of subdued real wage gains suggests that nominal compensation could rise more\nquickly without exerting any meaningful upward pressure on inflation. And, since wage\nmovements have historically been sensitive to tightness in the labor market, the recent\n14 Among the indicators in the “labor market conditions index” are the labor force participation rate,\nworkers classified as part time for economic reasons, hires, and quits. The index does not include the\nJOLTS job openings series but instead uses the Board staff’s composite help-wanted index, which has a\nlonger history; the two measures generally track each other closely. See Hess Chung, Bruce Fallick,\nChristopher Nekarda, and David Ratner (2014), “Assessing the Change in Labor Market Conditions,”\nFEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, May 22),\nwww.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/notes/feds-notes/2014/assessing-the-change-in-labor-market-\nconditions-20140522.html. For a closely related index of labor market conditions, see Craig S. Hakkio and\nJonathan L. Willis (2013), “Assessing Labor Market Conditions: The Level of Activity and the Speed of\nImprovement,” Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Macro Bulletin, July 18,\nwww.frbkc.org/publicat/research/macrobulletins/mb13Hakkio-Willis0718.pdf.\n\n- 10 -\nbehavior of both nominal and real wages point to weaker labor market conditions than\nwould be indicated by the current unemployment rate.\nThere are three reasons, however, why we should be cautious in drawing such a\nconclusion. First, the sluggish pace of nominal and real wage growth in recent years may\nreflect the phenomenon of “pent-up wage deflation.”15 The evidence suggests that many\nfirms faced significant constraints in lowering compensation during the recession and the\nearlier part of the recovery because of “downward nominal wage rigidity”--namely, an\ninability or unwillingness on the part of firms to cut nominal wages. To the extent that\nfirms faced limits in reducing real and nominal wages when the labor market was\nexceptionally weak, they may find that now they do not need to raise wages to attract\nqualified workers. As a result, wages might rise relatively slowly as the labor market\nstrengthens. If pent-up wage deflation is holding down wage growth, the current very\nmoderate wage growth could be a misleading signal of the degree of remaining slack.\nFurther, wages could begin to rise at a noticeably more rapid pace once pent-up wage\ndeflation has been absorbed.\nSecond, wage developments reflect not only cyclical but also secular trends that\nhave likely affected the evolution of labor’s share of income in recent years. As I noted,\nreal wages have been rising less rapidly than productivity, implying that real unit labor\ncosts have been declining, a pattern suggesting that there is scope for nominal wages to\naccelerate from their recent pace without creating meaningful inflationary pressure.\nHowever, research suggests that the decline in real unit labor costs may partly reflect\n15 See Mary Daly and Bart Hobijn (2014), “Downward Nominal Wage Rigidities Bend the Phillips Curve,”\nWorking Paper Series 2013-08 (San Francisco: Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, January),\nwww.frbsf.org/publications/economics/papers/2013/wp2013-08.pdf.\n\n- 11 -\nsecular factors that predate the recession, including changing patterns of production and\ninternational trade, as well as measurement issues.16 If so, productivity growth could\ncontinue to outpace real wage gains even when the economy is again operating at its\npotential.\nA third issue that complicates the interpretation of wage trends is the possibility\nthat, because of the dislocations of the Great Recession, transitory wage and price\npressures could emerge well before maximum sustainable employment has been reached,\nalthough they would abate over time as the economy moves back toward maximum\nemployment.17 The argument is that workers who have suffered long-term\nunemployment--along with, perhaps, those who have dropped out of the labor force but\nwould return to work in a stronger economy--face significant impediments to\nreemployment. In this case, further improvement in the labor market could entail\nstronger wage pressures for a time before maximum employment has been attained.18\n16 For a recent study of the decline in labor’s share, see Michael W.L. Elsby, Bart Hobijn, and Aysegul\nSahin (2013), “The Decline of the U.S. Labor Share,” Working Paper Series 2013-27 (San Francisco:\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, September), www.frbsf.org/economic-research/files/wp2013-\n27.pdf. The notion that the labor share of income is a good measure of slack was prominent in the\nempirical literature on the New-Keynesian Phillips Curve (for example, see Jordi Galí and Mark Gertler\n(1999), “Inflation Dynamics: A Structural Econometric Analysis,” Journal of Monetary Economics, vol.\n44 (October), pp. 195-222), and the connections (or lack thereof) between the labor share and traditional\nmeasures of slack (in the statistical sense) were highlighted in, among others, Michael T. Kiley (2007), “A\nQuantitative Comparison of Sticky-Price and Sticky-Information Models of Price Setting,” Journal of\nMoney, Credit and Banking, vol. 39 (February), pp. 101-25; and Michael T. Kiley (2013), “Output Gaps,”\nJournal of Macroeconomics, vol. 37 (September), pp. 1-18. Moreover, recent research has highlighted the\nchallenges that swings in the labor share have presented for the interpretation of inflation developments (for\nexample, Marco Del Negro, Marc P. Giannoni, and Frank Schorfheide (2014), “Inflation in the Great\nRecession and New Keynesian Models,” NBER Working Paper Series 20055 (Cambridge, Mass.: National\nBureau of Economic Research, April)).\n17 See Glenn D.

In my remaining time, I will turn to the special challenges that these\ndifficulties in assessing the labor market pose for evaluating the appropriate stance of\nmonetary policy.\nAny discussion of appropriate monetary policy must be framed by the Federal\nReserve’s dual mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability. For much\nof the past five years, the FOMC has been confronted with an obvious and substantial\ndegree of slack in the labor market and significant risks of slipping into persistent below-\ntarget inflation. In such circumstances, the need for extraordinary accommodation is\nunambiguous, in my view.\nHowever, with the economy getting closer to our objectives, the FOMC’s\nemphasis is naturally shifting to questions about the degree of remaining slack, how\n(2013), “The Phillips Curve Is Alive and Well: Inflation and the NAIRU during the Slow Recovery,”\nNBER Working Paper Series 19390 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, August).\nFor research highlighting potential alternative interpretations, see Michael T. Kiley (2014), “An Evaluation\nof the Inflationary Pressure Associated with Short- and Long-Term Unemployment,” Finance and\nEconomics Discussion Series 2014-28 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,\nMarch), www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2014/201428/201428pap.pdf; and Christopher Smith (2014),\n“The Effect of Labor Slack on Wages: Evidence from State-Level Relationships,” FEDS Notes\n(Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, June 2),\nwww.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/notes/feds-notes/2014/effect-of-labor-slack-on-wages-evidence-from-\nstate-level-relationships-20140602.html.\nThe interaction of labor force participation and inflationary pressures has been understudied, in part\nbecause the strong trends in participation due to demographic factors have implied that it is difficult to\nidentify the cyclical component. For an important example of a study demonstrating, within the core\nmacroeconomic framework widely used in research, that movements in participation should be considered\nin models of wage and price determination, see Christopher J. Erceg and Andrew T. Levin (2013), “Labor\nForce Participation and Monetary Policy in the Wake of the Great Recession,” IMF Working Paper\nWP/13/245 (Washington: International Monetary Fund, July),\nwww.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2013/wp13245.pdf.\n\n- 13 -\nquickly that slack is likely to be taken up, and thereby to the question of under what\nconditions we should begin dialing back our extraordinary accommodation. As should be\nevident from my remarks so far, I believe that our assessments of the degree of slack\nmust be based on a wide range of variables and will require difficult judgments about the\ncyclical and structural influences in the labor market. While these assessments have\nalways been imprecise and subject to revision, the task has become especially\nchallenging in the aftermath of the Great Recession, which brought nearly unprecedented\ncyclical dislocations and may have been associated with similarly unprecedented\nstructural changes in the labor market--changes that have yet to be fully understood.\nSo, what is a monetary policymaker to do? Some have argued that, in light of the\nuncertainties associated with estimating labor market slack, policymakers should focus\nmainly on inflation developments in determining appropriate policy. To take an extreme\ncase, if labor market slack was the dominant and predictable driver of inflation, we could\nlargely ignore labor market indicators and look instead at the behavior of inflation to\ndetermine the extent of slack in the labor market. In present circumstances, with inflation\nstill running below the FOMC’s 2 percent objective, such an approach would suggest that\nwe could maintain policy accommodation until inflation is clearly moving back toward 2\npercent, at which point we could also be confident that slack had diminished.\nOf course, our task is not nearly so straightforward. Historically, slack has\naccounted for only a small portion of the fluctuations in inflation. Indeed, unusual\naspects of the current recovery may have shifted the lead-lag relationship between a\ntightening labor market and rising inflation pressures in either direction. For example, as\nI discussed earlier, if downward nominal wage rigidities created a stock of pent-up wage\n\n- 14 -\ndeflation during the economic downturn, observed wage and price pressures associated\nwith a given amount of slack or pace of reduction in slack might be unusually low for a\ntime. If so, the first clear signs of inflation pressure could come later than usual in the\nprogression toward maximum employment. As a result, maintaining a high degree of\nmonetary policy accommodation until inflation pressures emerge could, in this case,\nunduly delay the removal of accommodation, necessitating an abrupt and potentially\ndisruptive tightening of policy later on.\nConversely, profound dislocations in the labor market in recent years--such as\ndepressed participation associated with worker discouragement and a still-substantial\nlevel of long-term unemployment--may cause inflation pressures to arise earlier than\nusual as the degree of slack in the labor market declines. However, some of the resulting\nwage and price pressures could subsequently ease as higher real wages draw workers\nback into the labor force and lower long-term unemployment.19 As a consequence,\ntightening monetary policy as soon as inflation moves back toward 2 percent might, in\nthis case, prevent labor markets from recovering fully and so would not be consistent\nwith the dual mandate.\nInferring the degree of resource utilization from real-time readings on inflation is\nfurther complicated by the familiar challenge of distinguishing transitory price changes\nfrom persistent price pressures. Indeed, the recent firming of inflation toward our\n2 percent goal appears to reflect a combination of both factors.\nThese complexities in evaluating the relationship between slack and inflation\npressures in the current recovery are illustrative of a host of issues that the FOMC will be\n19 See Rudebusch and Williams, “A Wedge in the Dual Mandate,” in note 17.\n\n- 15 -\ngrappling with as the recovery continues. There is no simple recipe for appropriate\npolicy in this context, and the FOMC is particularly attentive to the need to clearly\ndescribe the policy framework we are using to meet these challenges. As the FOMC has\nnoted in its recent policy statements, the stance of policy will be guided by our\nassessments of how far we are from our objectives of maximum employment and\n2 percent inflation as well as our assessment of the likely pace of progress toward those\nobjectives.\nAt the FOMC’s most recent meeting, the Committee judged, based on a range of\nlabor market indicators, that “labor market conditions improved.”20 Indeed, as I noted\nearlier, they have improved more rapidly than the Committee had anticipated.\nNevertheless, the Committee judged that underutilization of labor resources still remains\nsignificant. Given this assessment and the Committee’s expectation that inflation will\ngradually move up toward its longer-run objective, the Committee reaffirmed its view\n“that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds\nrate for a considerable time after our current asset purchase program ends, especially if\nprojected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and\nprovided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.”21 But if progress\nin the labor market continues to be more rapid than anticipated by the Committee or if\ninflation moves up more rapidly than anticipated, resulting in faster convergence toward\nour dual objectives, then increases in the federal funds rate target could come sooner than\nthe Committee currently expects and could be more rapid thereafter. Of course, if\n20 See paragraph 1 of Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2014), “Federal Reserve Issues\nFOMC Statement,” press release, July 30,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140730a.htm.\n21 See paragraph 5 in Board of Governors, “FOMC Statement” (July 2014), in note 20.\n\n- 16 -\neconomic performance turns out to be disappointing and progress toward our goals\nproceeds more slowly than we expect, then the future path of interest rates likely would\nbe more accommodative than we currently anticipate. As I have noted many times,\nmonetary policy is not on a preset path. The Committee will be closely monitoring\nincoming information on the labor market and inflation in determining the appropriate\nstance of monetary policy.\nOverall, I suspect that many of the labor market issues you will be discussing at\nthis conference will be at the center of FOMC discussions for some time to come. I thank\nyou in advance for the insights you will offer and encourage you to continue the\nimportant research that advances our understanding of cyclical and structural labor\nmarket issues.",

Yellen\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nHaas School of Business, University of California, Berkeley\nBerkeley, California\nNovember 13, 2012\n\nThank you. I’m delighted to be back at Haas, which I’ve been proud to call home\nfor much of my career. I’d like to thank Dean Lyons for inviting me to speak to you this\nafternoon.1\nMy subject is the recent revolution and continuing evolution in communication by\ncentral banks. All of us, of course, live in an era of revolutionary advances in\ncommunication: If I succeed in saying anything interesting this afternoon, those words\nmay be posted, tweeted, and blogged about even before I’ve left this podium. So, it\nmight seem unsurprising that the Federal Reserve, too, is bolstering its efforts at\ncommunication.\nBut the revolution in central bank communication is not driven by technological\nadvances. Rather, it is the product of advances in our understanding of how to make\nmonetary policy most effective. A growing body of research and experience\ndemonstrates that clear communication is itself a vital tool for increasing the efficacy and\nreliability of monetary policy. In fact, the challenges facing our economy in the wake of\nthe financial crisis have made clear communication more important than ever before.\nToday I’ll discuss the revolution in thinking about central bank transparency and how,\npushed by the unique situation precipitated by the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve\nhas responded with fundamental advances in communication. Indeed, I hope that one of\nthe legacies of this difficult period is a permanent and substantial advance in Federal\nReserve transparency, building on the policies I’ll talk about shortly.\nAs you all know, the Federal Reserve is actively promoting a faster recovery. Our\nefforts are hampered by the fact that our standard policy tool, the federal funds rate, is\n1 I am indebted to members of the Board staff--Jon Faust, Thomas Laubach, and John Maggs--who\ncontributed to the preparation of these remarks.\n\n- 2 -\nnear zero and cannot be reduced much further. In this extraordinary environment, the\nFederal Reserve is employing two unconventional policy tools to spur job creation and\ngrowth: large-scale asset purchases, which some people call quantitative easing, and\ncommunications about the future course of monetary policy, also known as forward\nguidance.\nAt the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) meeting in September, the\nFOMC--the Federal Reserve’s principal monetary policymaking body--employed both of\nthese unconventional tools. The Committee initiated a new large-scale asset purchase\nprogram to buy mortgage-backed securities (MBS). In addition, with regard to forward\nguidance, the Committee said that, first, it intends to continue buying MBS and other\nassets until it sees a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.2\nSecond, the Committee stated that it expects a highly accommodative stance of monetary\npolicy to remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery\nstrengthens. And third, the Committee noted that it currently expects to hold the federal\nfunds rate at exceptionally low levels at least through mid-2015, about a half-year longer\nthan previously announced.\nThe three elements of forward guidance that were adopted by the FOMC in\nSeptember 2012 would have been unthinkable in 1992 and greatly surprising in 2002, but\nthey have, in my view, become a centerpiece of appropriate monetary policy. To better\nexplain my views regarding the FOMC’s forward guidance, I will first discuss how it fits\ninto the Committee’s broader thinking and communication about monetary policy. The\n2 The September FOMC meeting statement further indicates that the Committee will take account of the\nlikely efficacy and costs of such purchases in determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset\npurchases. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC\nStatement,” press release, September 13,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20120913a.htm.\n\n- 3 -\nFOMC took a major step to explain this thinking last January when it issued for the first\ntime a “Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Policy Strategy.”3 This statement provides a\nconcise description of the FOMC’s objectives in conducting monetary policy and the\napproach the Committee considers appropriate to achieve them. I will present my views\non the implications of this statement for monetary policy in current circumstances. I will\nthen discuss several approaches the FOMC has recently considered to enhance its\ncommunications to make its policy more effective in this challenging situation. Let me\nemphasize that the views I express here are my own and do not necessarily represent\nthose of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe Case for Central Bank Transparency\nTo fully appreciate the recent revolution in central bank communication and its\nimplications for current policy, it is useful to recall that for decades, the conventional\nwisdom was that secrecy about the central bank’s goals and actions actually makes\nmonetary policy more effective. In 1977, when I started my first job at the Federal\nReserve Board as a staff economist in the Division of International Finance, it was an\narticle of faith in central banking that secrecy about monetary policy decisions was the\nbest policy: Central banks, as a rule, did not discuss these decisions, let alone their future\npolicy intentions. While the Federal Reserve is required by the Congress to promote\n3 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement\nof Longer-Run Goals and Policy Strategy,” press release, January 25,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20120125c.htm. I should note that this statement\ngrew out of discussions within the FOMC that date back to the early 1990s. For a proposal from 2003 by\nthe then Governor Bernanke, see Ben S. Bernanke (2003), “Panel Discussion,” speech delivered at the 28th\nAnnual Policy Conference: Inflation Targeting Prospects and Problems, Federal Reserve Bank of St.\nLouis, St. Louis, Missouri, October 17,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2003/20031017/default.htm. My own thinking on the issue\nhas evolved over the years; for a snapshot of its state in early 2006, see Janet L. Yellen (2006), “Enhancing\nFed Credibility,” speech delivered at the Annual Washington Policy Conference Sponsored by the National\nAssociation for Business Economics, Washington, March 13,\nwww.frbsf.org/news/speeches/2006/0313.html.\n\n- 4 -\nstable prices and maximum employment, Federal Reserve officials at that time avoided\ndiscussing how policy would be used to pursue both sides of this mandate. Indeed, mere\nmention of the employment side of the mandate, even by the mid-1990s, was described in\na New York Times article as the equivalent of “sticking needles in the eyes of central\nbankers.”4\nThis secretiveness regarding monetary policy decisions clashed with the openness\nregarding government decisions expected in a democracy, especially since Federal\nReserve decisions influence the lives of every American. And there were critics within\nthe economics profession. James Tobin and Milton Friedman, both Nobel laureates,\ndisagreed on almost every aspect of monetary policy, but they were united in arguing that\ntransparency regarding central bank decisions is vital in a democracy to lend legitimacy\nto policy decisions.5 Surely only some important societal interest requiring opacity could\njustify the traditional practice. Indeed, in 1975 a citizen demanding greater openness\nsued the FOMC to obtain immediate release of the policy directive upon its adoption, and\nin 1981 the case was resolved in favor of deferred disclosure.6\nIronically, while this transparency lawsuit was wending its way through the\ncourts, Robert Lucas and others were publishing research that would garner several\nNobel prizes and ultimately overturn the traditional wisdom that secrecy regarding policy\n4 See Keith Bradsher (1994), “Tough-Decision Time for the Federal Reserve; New Vice Chairman Stirs the\nBoard’s Pot,” New York Times, September 26, www.nytimes.com/1994/09/26/business/tough-decision-\ntime-for-federal-reserve-new-vice-chairman-stirs-board-s-pot.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm.\n5 See Milton Friedman (1962), “Should There Be an Independent Monetary Authority?” in Leland B.\nYeager, ed., In Search of a Monetary Constitution (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press),\npp. 219-43; and James Tobin (1992), “Prepared Statement,” in The Monetary Policy Reform Act of 1991,\nhearing before the Subcommittee on International Finance and Monetary Policy of the Committee on\nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, November 13, 1991, S.1611, 102 Cong. (Washington:\nGovernment Printing Office), pp. 25-33. n (\n6 See David R. Merrill and others v. Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve System, U.S.\nDistrict Court of the District of Columbia, 443 U.S. 340 (1979). Disclosure of the directive adopted at a\ngiven FOMC meeting was deferred until after the following meeting, at which time the released directive\nwould be superseded by a new directive.\n\n- 5 -\nactions was the best policy.7 A key insight of these scholars was that monetary policy\naffects employment, incomes, and inflation to a large extent through its effects on the\npublic’s expectations about future policy. Many spending decisions, such as financing\nthe purchase of a home or businesses’ capital expenditures, depend on longer-term\ninterest rates that are connected to monetary policy through expectations of short-term\ninterest rates over the lifetime of a mortgage or an investment project. In other words, the\neffect of monetary policy on the economy today depends not only, or even primarily, on\nthe FOMC’s current target for the federal funds rate or the quantity of assets on its\nbalance sheet, but rather on how the public expects the Federal Reserve to set the paths of\nthese variables in the future. These expectations influence longer-term interest rates and\nasset prices as well as the public’s views concerning the likely future paths of income and\ninflation.\nThe history of oil price shocks is a good example to illustrate this point. In the\n1970s, two large oil price shocks led to sharp increases in general inflation that were not\nmet with prompt inflation-fighting actions by the Federal Reserve. This delay left the\npublic unsure whether the Federal Reserve would act to reverse the increase in inflation,\nand expectations of longer-term inflation ratcheted up. When the Federal Reserve\neventually did act to bring inflation down from double-digit levels, the consequence was\nthe painful recession of 1981 and 1982.\nThe effects of that policy shift were severe, but the decision helped change\nexpectations of the Federal Reserve’s commitment to price stability, and thereby\nultimately led to longer-run inflation expectations becoming anchored at their current low\n7 While Robert Lucas mainly analyzed models in which only monetary surprises have any effect on real\nactivity, his important insight in the present context was that the perceived monetary policy rule is critical\nin determining the effects of monetary policy actions, both anticipated and unanticipated.\n\n- 6 -\nlevels. As a result, a series of large increases in oil prices starting in 2005 did not unleash\na general rise in inflation or longer-term inflation expectations. The public seemed to\ncorrectly perceive that the Federal Reserve would not allow an oil price shock to\nprecipitate a general rise in inflation. Longer-term inflation expectations remained well\nanchored, and hence no aggressive and recessionary disinflation action by the Federal\nReserve was required. Thus, over the quarter century up to the mid-2000s, the Federal\nReserve established a record of policymaking that allowed the public to predict monetary\npolicy responses to unforeseen events such as an oil price shock with reasonable\naccuracy.\nUnfortunately, recent events have made it harder for the public to predict the\nfuture course of monetary policy. Economic weakness since the financial crisis and the\nGreat Recession has confounded hopes for a speedy recovery and has required\nunprecedented monetary policy actions. Shortly after the financial crisis erupted, the\nFederal Reserve reduced the federal funds rate to almost zero and launched a number of\ntemporary liquidity and credit programs to keep the financial system operating. Even\nthese aggressive policy responses, however, were not enough to halt the contraction, and\nfurther action was needed to stop the economy from falling into a second Great\nDepression. To this end, the Federal Reserve started to expand its balance sheet through\npurchases of longer-term Treasury securities and agency debt and MBS in an effort to put\nfurther downward pressure on long-term interest rates and so stimulate the economy.\nWith the federal funds rate near zero, and the Federal Reserve deploying the new\ntool of large-scale asset purchases, it became much more difficult for the public to\nanticipate how the FOMC would likely conduct policy over time, and how the overall\n\n- 7 -\nstance of monetary policy would both affect and respond to economic conditions. In this\nsituation, the FOMC began to rely heavily on forward guidance about both the likely\nfuture path of the federal funds rate and the Committee’s intentions concerning asset\npurchases and sales.8 But, for this guidance to have its maximum effect, it must be\nunderstood and believed by the public, and therefore provide the public with a solid basis\nfor forming their borrowing and spending decisions today.9 In my view, such credibility\ncan be achieved only if the public understands the FOMC’s objectives and intentions.\nCommunications after the Financial Crisis\nChairman Bernanke asked me to take up these challenges in 2010 as chair of a\nnew FOMC communications subcommittee.10 Central bank transparency had long been\nan issue of great interest to both of us, and the Chairman had been an exceptionally\nstrong voice for central bank transparency in his academic work and in his earlier service\non the Board of Governors. Throughout the Chairman’s term, the FOMC has made\nimportant strides in transparency through actions such as introducing the Committee’s\nquarterly Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which provides information about\n8 The FOMC also provided information concerning its “exit strategy” in the minutes of its June 2011\nmeeting (see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2011), Minutes of the Federal Open\nMarket Committee, June 21-22, www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20110622.pdf).\nThe Committee indicated that it intends to normalize the size and composition of its balance sheet by\nselling off agency securities at a gradual pace after it begins the process of raising the federal funds rate.\n9 Economic theory suggests that the public’s expectations concerning the time path of the Federal Reserve’s\nasset holdings--which includes both the ultimate size of those holdings and the length of time that these\nassets will be retained on the Fed’s balance sheet--influence longer-term yields and the term premiums\nembedded in those yields today. For empirical estimates of these effects see, for example, Canlin Li and\nMin Wei (2012), “Term Structure Modeling with Supply Factors and the Federal Reserve’s Large Scale\nAsset Purchase Programs,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2012-37 (Washington: Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System, May),\nwww.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2012/201237/201237abs.html.\n10 Similar subcommittees acting in the early 1990s dealt with FOMC policies concerning the disclosure of\nthe minutes and transcripts of FOMC meetings. An FOMC subcommittee in 1999 laid the groundwork for\nthe current FOMC postmeeting statements. And a subcommittee appointed in 2006, led by the then Vice\nChairman Kohn, considered the adoption of a numerical inflation objective and recommended\nenhancements that were incorporated in the Summary of Economic Projections.\n\n- 8 -\nparticipants’ forecasts for the economy under their individual views concerning\nappropriate policy and their longer-run assessments of potential output growth, the\n“normal” unemployment rate, and the most appropriate inflation rate.\nA high priority for the Chairman was to further clarify the FOMC’s interpretation\nof the long-term objectives implied by its dual mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices. While we had made progress, as I just noted, during the\nyears preceding the crisis, the FOMC as a body had never provided an explicit\ndescription of its policy goals beyond quoting its mandate. We saw further clarification\nof these objectives as important for the sake of transparency and accountability. But\nbeyond that, an explicit statement of goals had become essential for the Committee to\nachieve its monetary policy objectives in the aftermath of the crisis, including allowing\nheavier reliance than in the past on forward guidance on the future path of policy.\nA particular concern, given that the crisis had ushered in a prolonged period of\nelevated unemployment, was that the weakness in the economy might push inflation well\nbelow 2 percent, a level that many took to be an implicit target of the FOMC. There was\neven an ongoing risk that low inflation might turn to deflation and further hamper\ngrowth. These challenges led to legitimate questions among forecasters and the public\nabout just what the FOMC meant by “maximum employment” and “stable prices.”\nThe FOMC could have chosen to adopt an “inflation-targeting framework,” in\nwhich it would have specified an objective solely for inflation, without any explicit\nreference to employment. Such an approach has been adopted by a large number of\ncentral banks since the 1990s. While the FOMC had debated adopting an inflation target\non a number of occasions since the mid-1990s, some Committee members believed that\n\n- 9 -\nstating an explicit target for inflation alone would undermine the maximum-employment\nside of the dual mandate. In fact, some central banks that have been assigned a single\nmandate of inflation stabilization have struggled to explain how the goals of growth and\nfinancial stability figure into their inflation-targeting framework.11\nA Consensus on Monetary Policy Goals\nLast January, the FOMC took a major step to clarify its interpretation of its dual\nmandate, issuing the “Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy”\nthat I mentioned earlier. Unlike the regular postmeeting statements, which are intended\nto remain current only until the next FOMC meeting, this statement is meant to be a more\nenduring expression of the FOMC’s policy objectives and how it plans to pursue them.\nThe intention is that the public can count on the principles expressed in the statement to\nremain unchanged for some time to come, even as the economic outlook changes. For\nthat reason, the Committee sought the endorsement of all its participants--the Board\nmembers and all 12 Reserve Bank presidents--not only the voting members. My\nexpectation is that this “consensus statement” will be reaffirmed each January, perhaps\nwith minor modifications but with the core principles intact.\nImportantly, the consensus statement provides a numerical value--2 percent--for\nthe Committee’s longer-run inflation goal. But importantly, it pairs that inflation goal\nwith a specific goal for maximum employment. In particular, the statement cites a range\nsummarizing FOMC participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal rate of\nunemployment. Finally, the statement says that the Committee will follow a “balanced\n11 See, for example, the discussions in Lars E.O. Svensson (1999), “Inflation Targeting as a Monetary\nPolicy Rule,” Journal of Monetary Economics, vol. 43 (June), pp. 607-54; and in Jon Faust and Dale W.\nHenderson (2004), “Is Inflation Targeting Best-Practice Monetary Policy?” Federal Reserve Bank of St.\nLouis Review, vol. 86 (July/August), pp 117-44,\nwww.research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/article/4031.\n\n- 10 -\napproach” as it “seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from its longer-run goal and\ndeviations of employment from the Committee’s assessments of its maximum level.”12\nThe specification of 2 percent as the Committee’s longer-run inflation goal, as\nmeasured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures\n(PCE), reflected careful deliberation. The Committee judged that the PCE price index is\nthe most reliable measure of prices that are relevant for households and, in choosing the\n2 percent goal, balanced two main considerations. First, any rate of price inflation,\nwhether positive or negative, imposes some costs on society, making planning more\ndifficult and creating distortions in the economy. Second, were the FOMC to aim for\nzero inflation to eliminate these costs, it would face greater difficulty in providing\nsufficient monetary accommodation in response to large negative shocks. With inflation\nat zero, the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates implies that real short-term\ninterest rates cannot be reduced below zero. In contrast, with low but positive inflation,\nthey can be.13 History has shown that sustained periods of even mild deflation can\nimpose immense costs in terms of slow growth and high unemployment.14 Thus,\nbalancing the goal of maximum employment against the costs of modest inflation, the\nCommittee chose 2 percent measured inflation as the value it judged likely to provide an\nadequate buffer against costly deflations while keeping the costs of inflation quite small.\nGiven that the rate of inflation over the longer run is determined solely by\nmonetary policy, central banks can, and indeed must, determine the long-run level of\n12 See Board of Governors, “FOMC Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Policy Strategy,” in note 3.\n13 Due to well-known upward biases in the PCE and other indexes of consumer prices as measures of the\ncost of living, zero inflation, properly measured, corresponds to a positive measured level of PCE inflation,\nmost likely on the order of 1/2 percent.\n14 The detrimental effects of unanticipated deflation are discussed in remarks by the then Governor\nBernanke. See Ben S. Bernanke (2002), “Deflation: Making Sure ‘It’ Doesn’t Happen Here,” speech\ndelivered at the National Economists Club, Washington, November 21,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2002/20021121/default.htm.\n\n- 11 -\ninflation. In contrast, they cannot do much to affect the maximum sustainable level of\nemployment. That level is determined by factors affecting the structure and dynamics of\nthe labor market that are almost completely outside the control of the central bank.\nNonetheless, the Committee felt strongly that it should provide some quantitative\ninterpretation of economic conditions consistent with the maximum employment portion\nof the Fed’s mandate. Failure to do so might be seen as elevating the inflation side of the\ndual mandate above the employment side. The Committee chose to couch the longer-run\nemployment objective in terms of the rate of unemployment while indicating that other\nindicators may also be relevant in assessing the maximum level of employment.\nUnfortunately, there is a considerable range of disagreement in the economics profession\nand on the FOMC itself about what this longer-run normal rate of unemployment is.\nMoreover, there is widespread recognition that whatever the normal rate might be today,\nit can change over time. So the consensus statement notes that, as of January 2012,\nFOMC participants’ estimates of this rate had a central tendency of 5.2 percent to\n6.0 percent. I expect the FOMC to review its estimates of the longer-run normal rate of\nunemployment in its annual reaffirmation of the consensus statement on goals and\nstrategy.\nSetting Longer-Run Objectives and Minimizing Shorter-Run Fluctuations\nAs I mentioned before, stating longer-run goals is only one part of clarifying the\ndual mandate. The other part involves explaining how the FOMC will conduct policy to\nattain its longer-run objectives over time. Because shocks to the economy regularly push\ninflation and unemployment away from the Committee’s objectives, the FOMC must\nadjust policy to mitigate such deviations from its goals. We can therefore think of two\n\n- 12 -\ntasks for monetary policymakers: first, setting policy to pursue the longer-run objectives;\nand second, adjusting policy in response to shocks to minimize shorter-run fluctuations\naround those objectives.\nClarity on longer-run goals, due to the important role of expectations, can itself\nhelp reduce short-run fluctuations. In the words of the January consensus statement,\n“communicating this inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep longer-term inflation\nexpectations firmly anchored, thereby fostering price stability and moderate long-term\ninterest rates and enhancing the Committee’s ability to promote maximum employment\nin the face of significant economic disturbances.”15\nPut differently, the purpose of providing greater clarity about the FOMC’s longer-\nrun inflation goal is to anchor inflation expectations more firmly. These more firmly\nanchored expectations in turn free the Committee’s hand to more actively and effectively\nstabilize short-run fluctuations in economic activity. The Committee can act in this way\nbecause the FOMC can tolerate transitory deviations of inflation from its objective in\norder to more forcefully stabilize employment without needing to worry that the public\nwill mistake these actions as the pursuit of a higher or lower long-run inflation objective.\nThe instability of inflation, inflation expectations, and employment in response to the oil\nprice increases of the 1970s vividly illustrates the threat posed by price shocks when\nlonger-term inflation expectations are not well anchored.\nTo minimize short-run fluctuations, the FOMC also needs to decide how to\nrespond to shocks that push the economy away from price stability and maximum\nemployment. The goals of stable prices and maximum employment are often\n15 See Board of Governors, “FOMC Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Policy Strategy,” in note 3.\n\n- 13 -\ncomplementary: Policymakers need not sacrifice performance on one goal to pursue the\nother. However, the pursuit of the two sides of the dual mandate can temporarily\nconflict. For example, returning inflation to its longer-run goal might require, say, a\ntighter stance of monetary policy, whereas returning the economy to maximum\nemployment might require just the opposite. The consensus statement explains that in\nsuch circumstances the FOMC will pursue a balanced approach, taking into account the\nmagnitude of the deviation of each variable from its objective and allowing for the\npossibility that the deviations may not be eliminated over the same time horizon. The\nbalanced-approach strategy endorsed by the FOMC is consistent with the view that\nmaximum employment and price stability stand on an equal footing as objectives of\nmonetary policy.\nAs I see it, such a balanced approach has two important implications that deserve\nemphasis. The first is that, if the FOMC is doing its best to minimize deviations from its\nobjectives, then, over long periods, both unemployment and inflation will be about\nequally likely to fall on either side of those objectives. To put it simply, if 2 percent\ninflation is the Committee’s goal, 2 percent cannot be viewed as a ceiling for inflation\nbecause that would result in deviations that are more frequently below 2 percent than\nabove and thus not properly balanced with the goal of maximum employment. Instead, to\nbalance the chances that inflation will sometimes deviate a bit above and a bit below the\ngoal, 2 percent must be treated as a central tendency around which inflation fluctuates.\nThe same holds true for fluctuations of unemployment around its longer-run normal rate.\nThe second property, which to me is the essence of the balanced approach, is that\nreducing the deviation of one variable from its objective must at times involve allowing\n\n- 14 -\nthe other variable to move away from its objective. In particular, reducing inflation may\nsometimes require a monetary tightening that will lead to a temporary rise in\nunemployment. And a policy that reduces unemployment may, at times, result in\ninflation that could temporarily rise above its target.\nCommunicating the Economic Outlook and Its Policy Implications\nHow can we translate the principles embodied in the Committee’s consensus\nstatement of longer-run goals and strategy into a concrete plan of action for the current\nsituation? And, having done so, how can we make such a plan understandable to the\npublic? I’ll next illustrate a method I use to help me judge the best plan of action at a\nparticular time. I will then describe the communications tools the Committee is now\nusing to explain its strategy and discuss others it is considering to better explain its policy\ndecisions to the public.\nIn addition to clearly specified goals, concrete recommendations about\nappropriate monetary policy require the specification of a baseline outlook for the\neconomy and also a realistic, quantitative model of the economy to assess how monetary\npolicy choices affect the likely paths of the FOMC’s goal variables--namely, inflation\nand the unemployment rate. Figure 1 presents such an outlook, one based on a survey of\nthe Federal Reserve’s primary dealers conducted during the week prior to the September\nFOMC meeting. The baseline paths through 2015 of the unemployment rate and inflation\nshown by the solid black lines in the upper two panels track the median of the dealers’\nforecasts of these variables. Beyond 2015, the path assumes that the unemployment rate\nconverges over time to 6 percent--the median forecast of the long-run unemployment\nrate, which is the upper end of the range of estimates of the longer-run normal\n\n- 15 -\nunemployment rate cited in the FOMC consensus statement--while the inflation rate\nsettles down at 2 percent, the FOMC’s inflation objective and the median long-run\nforecast in the dealer survey.\nThe solid black line in the bottom panel of the figure shows the median of\ndealers’ expectations for the path of the federal funds rate through the end of 2015. The\ndealers assumed it would remain near zero through the first half of 2015, consistent with\nthe guidance the Committee subsequently provided. Beyond 2015, the federal funds rate\nis assumed to gradually rise to 4 percent, the long-run value expected by most dealers as\nwell as most FOMC participants. I have assumed in the baseline that this process is\nlargely completed within four years.16\nThe question I now want to address is whether this illustrative baseline path for\nthe federal funds rate is one that reflects a balanced approach to attaining our longer-run\nobjectives, consistent with our consensus statement. As I noted, this balanced approach\nmeans inflation and unemployment will sometimes temporarily deviate from longer-run\nobjectives, but that these deviations would be minimized. To answer this question I need\nto rely, as I noted, on a specific macroeconomic model, and, for this purpose, I will\nemploy the FRB/US model, one of the economic models commonly used at the Board.\nThe model lets us analyze every possible policy path to see which one yields the best\nfeasible outcome for the paths of unemployment and inflation. Although the exact\n16 It is worth noting that the dealer forecasts probably incorporate some effect from asset purchases that\nwere only later announced by the FOMC. At the time of this survey, the median probability that the\nprimary dealers assigned to the FOMC announcing a new program of asset purchases in September was\n55% and the median probability assigned to further asset purchases within one year was 70%. The median\nvalue of asset purchases anticipated by the dealers under such a program was about $500 billion. In the\nsimulations that follow, I treat the balance sheet as unchanged relative to its baseline path, and focus on the\nfederal funds rate as the tool for conducting monetary policy even though the Committee is currently using\nboth forward guidance concerning the funds rate path and the balance sheet to provide monetary\naccommodation. (The text of this footnote has been revised since its original release.)\n\n- 16 -\nnumerical results of the exercises I am about to report depend on the specific model, the\nqualitative points that I’ll highlight are fairly general.\nTo derive a path for the federal funds rate consistent with the Committee’s\nenunciated longer-run goals and balanced approach, I assume that monetary policy aims\nto minimize the deviations of inflation from 2 percent and the deviations of the\nunemployment rate from 6 percent, with equal weight on both objectives.17 In computing\nthe best, or “optimal policy,” path for the federal funds rate to achieve these objectives, I\nwill assume that the public fully anticipates that the FOMC will follow this optimal plan\nand is able to assess its effect on the economy.18\nThe blue lines with triangles labeled “Optimal policy” show the resulting paths.\nThe optimal policy to implement this “balanced approach” to minimizing deviations from\nthe inflation and unemployment goals involves keeping the federal funds rate close to\nzero until early 2016, about two quarters longer than in the illustrative baseline, and\nkeeping the federal funds rate below the baseline path through 2018. This highly\naccommodative policy path generates a faster reduction in unemployment than in the\nbaseline, while inflation slightly overshoots the Committee’s 2 percent objective for\nseveral years.\n17 More precisely, the loss function that the central bank is assumed to minimize is the discounted sum of\ncurrent and future squared deviations of inflation from 2 percent, current and future squared deviations of\nthe unemployment rate from 6 percent, and current and future quarterly changes in the federal funds rate.\nThe last term is included to avoid unrealistically large quarterly movements in the “optimal” federal funds\nrate path.\n18 This illustration takes the anticipated scale of asset purchases as fixed. The effect of these purchases,\ngiven that the modal expectation in the primary dealer survey was for $500 billion of purchases, is\nimplicitly already incorporated into the baseline forecast. In principle, we could use the FRB/US model to\nperform a joint optimization exercise in which the optimal paths of asset purchases and the federal funds\nrate are simultaneously determined, but the results from such an exercise would be highly sensitive to\nassumptions about possible costs of asset purchases that are not well defined, such as the potential for\nmarket disruption.\n\n- 17 -\nThis path illustrates one of the key features of optimal policy under a balanced\napproach to the dual mandate. Provided that long-term inflation expectations are firmly\nanchored, the federal funds rate is set to balance the benefits from a faster reduction of\nthe unemployment rate against the losses from a temporary and modest increase of\ninflation above 2 percent. The more rapid reduction in unemployment along the optimal\ncontrol path than in the baseline reflects the stimulus to demand provided by lower\nnominal and real interest rates, higher asset prices, and the expectation of more rapid\ngrowth in employment and income.19\nThe computation of an optimal path for monetary policy is obviously\ncomplicated, and, as I’ll discuss, it’s challenging to communicate. It rests on many\nassumptions about the outlook for the economy and its structure. An alternative and\nmuch simpler approach would entail setting the federal funds rate according to the\nprescriptions of a policy rule, such as the well-known Taylor rule or a variant. Many\nstudies have shown that, in normal times, when the economy is buffeted by typical\nshocks--not the extraordinary shock resulting from the financial crisis--simple rules can\ncome pretty close to approximating optimal policies. In fact, empirical research suggests\nthat a modified version of the original Taylor rule fits the behavior of the Fed reasonably\nwell from the late 1980s until the financial crisis. Given that participants in financial\nmarkets are familiar with both the FOMC’s historical behavior and simple rules, the\ncommunications challenges might arguably be less severe if the FOMC followed such a\n19 It is also worth noting that the “Exit Strategy Principles” adopted by the FOMC in June 2011 indicate\nthat the Committee intends to gradually sell off agency securities to normalize the size and composition of\nits portfolio after liftoff of the federal funds rate. This assumption pertaining to asset sales is incorporated\ninto the FRB/US simulations, and provides a further reason why, along the optimal control path, the federal\nfunds rate stays low for so long, rising only gradually after liftoff.\n\n- 18 -\nstrategy.20 To be sure, I would never advocate turning over monetary policy to a\ncomputer, but why shouldn’t the FOMC adopt such a rule as a guidepost to policy?\nThe answer is that times are by no means normal now, and the simple rules that\nperform well under ordinary circumstances just won’t perform well with persistently\nstrong headwinds restraining recovery and with the federal funds rate constrained by the\nzero bound. A further simulation serves to illustrate that such rules would perform\nrelatively poorly at the current time. The red lines with squares labeled “Modified Taylor\nrule” show the economic outcomes that would be expected if the federal funds rate were\nset according to the prescriptions of a rule that is similar to the original Taylor rule, with\nthe only difference being that it responds equally to deviations of unemployment and\ninflation from their respective longer-run values.\nThe figure shows that this rule would raise the federal funds rate substantially\nearlier than the optimal path and thereby leads to more protracted deviations of the\nunemployment rate above its longer-run normal level without any measurable gains in\nkeeping inflation closer to the 2 percent target. In contrast, the optimal policy results in\nbetter economic outcomes. In effect, it compensates for the period of economic\nweakness induced by both the zero lower bound and the unusual persistence and severity\nof the headwinds now buffeting the economy by holding the federal funds rate lower for\n20 The rule is defined as R = 2 + π + 0.5(π - 2) + 1.0Y. In this expression, R is the federal funds rate, π is\nt t t t\nthe percent change in the headline PCE price index from four quarters earlier, and Y is the output gap. The\noutput gap is approximated using Okun’s law; specifically, Y = 2.0(6-U), where 2.0 is the estimated value\nt t\nof the Okun’s law coefficient and 6 is the assumed value of the non-accelerating inflation rate of\nunemployment, or NAIRU. In a recent speech (see Janet L. Yellen (2012), “The Economic Outlook and\nMonetary Policy,” speech delivered at the Money Marketeers of New York University, New York,\nApril 11, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20120411a.htm), I dubbed this rule “Taylor\n(1999),” as John Taylor described the rule in a paper published that year. See John B. Taylor (1999), “A\nHistorical Analysis of Monetary Policy Rules,” in John B. Taylor, ed., Monetary Policy Rules (Chicago:\nUniversity of Chicago Press), pp. 319-41. As Taylor’s own strong preference is for his original rule--\nTaylor (1993)--I now refer to the later rule as the “modified Taylor rule.” (The text of this footnote has\nbeen revised since its original release.)\n\n- 19 -\nlonger than the modified Taylor rule, thereby maintaining greater accommodation as the\neconomic recovery takes hold.21\nThe Future of FOMC Communications\nThe fact that simple rules aren’t as useful in current circumstances as they would\nbe for the FOMC at other times poses a significant challenge for FOMC communications,\nespecially since private-sector Fed watchers have frequently relied on such rules to\nunderstand and predict the Committee’s decisions on the federal funds rate.22 In\nparticular, private-sector forecasters commonly use such rules to revise their expectations\nconcerning the path of the federal funds rate in response to news that alters their views\nconcerning the outlook for the economy.\nNow, however, the federal funds rate may well diverge for a number of years\nfrom the prescriptions of simple rules. Moreover, the FOMC announced an open-ended\nasset purchase program in September, and there is no historical record for the public to\nuse in forming expectations on how the FOMC is likely to use this tool. Thus, the current\nsituation makes it very important that the FOMC provide private-sector forecasters with\nthe information they need to predict how the likely path of policy will change in response\nto changes in the outlook. While a clear statement of the Committee’s goals and the\nstrategy it will use to achieve them was an important and necessary step in this regard,\nthe exercise we’ve just undertaken illustrates that a host of additional assumptions and\n21 I would note that the original Taylor rule, which places only one-half as much weight as the modified\nrule on unemployment deviations, would already have raised the federal funds rate above the zero bound,\nproducing far worse outcomes than any illustrated in figure 1.\n22 The baseline path, based through the end of 2015 on the primary dealer survey, assumes greater\naccommodation than would be consistent with the modified Taylor rule, suggesting that FOMC\ncommunications have had some success in conveying the desirability of such an approach.\n\n- 20 -\ninformation is needed to derive the concrete implications of the consensus statement for\nthe FOMC’s policy decisions.\nThe challenge facing the FOMC now is to devise ways to communicate its policy\nintentions during a period in which policy will most likely be constrained by the zero\nbound on short-term rates and asset purchases will be actively used to foster faster\ngrowth. I think the existing FOMC postmeeting statement already goes some way in this\ndirection. With respect to the path of the federal funds rate, it offers a date--mid-2015--as\nthe earliest time at which the Committee currently anticipates that liftoff might be\nwarranted. As the simulations illustrate, this date is later than the modified Taylor rule\nwould predict and closer to the predictions of the optimal policy simulation. This later\nliftoff date is consistent with the Committee’s statement that “a highly accommodative\nstance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the\neconomic recovery strengthens.”23 Moreover, the simulations also suggest that, once\nliftoff from the zero lower bound occurs, it would be optimal for the federal funds rate to\nremain for some time below the prescriptions from a rule, such as the modified Taylor\nrule, that might in the past have provided a good guide to the Committee’s action.\nFinally, with respect to asset purchases, the guidance indicates that, subject to ongoing\nevaluations of their efficacy and costs, purchases will continue until there is a substantial\nimprovement in the outlook for the labor market in a context of price stability.\nImportantly, this open-ended plan reflects a goal-oriented approach in which the ultimate\nquantity of asset purchases will be geared to the attainment of sufficient progress toward\nthe Committee’s employment goal.\n23 See Board of Governors, “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,” September 13, note 2.\n\n- 21 -\nCould the FOMC go further in enhancing its communications? One logical\npossibility would be for the Committee to publish forecasts akin to those I’ve presented\nin figure 1. That is, the Committee could provide the public with its projections for\ninflation and the unemployment rate together with what it views as appropriate paths both\nfor the federal funds rate and its asset holdings, conditional on its current outlook for the\neconomy. Over time, these projections would be revised in response to incoming data\nthat alters the Committee’s economic outlook or, instead, because the Committee decides\nto alter its policy stance. Several inflation-targeting central banks, such as those in\nSweden and Norway, publish forecasts of this type. Such a forecast could be highly\ninformative, and, in recent months, the FOMC has explored whether it might be\nachievable. Not surprisingly perhaps, in a Committee of 19 participants with diverse\nviews on the structure of the economy and appropriate policy, a detailed consensus\nforecast is exceptionally difficult to develop. As an alternative, the FOMC could try to\nbuild on the individual projections of macroeconomic variables and policy already\nincluded in its quarterly SEP to provide at least some further information about how these\nindividual projections inform the Committee’s collective policy judgment.\nImprovements along these lines are currently under active consideration.24\n24 In the SEP, participants provide paths for the unemployment rate, real GDP growth, and inflation that\neach expects under his or her own view of the policy that is most appropriate to achieve the Committee’s\ndual mandate. But as is apparent in the SEP, participants have a great diversity of views on matters such as\nthe expected timing and subsequent pace of federal funds rate increases. The SEP currently provides\ninformation about the separate distributions of the projections for inflation, real activity, and the federal\nfunds rate over the next few years, but it does not provide the joint paths--that is, multivariate projections.\nThe public cannot, for example, infer whether a projection for higher inflation in 2015 was made by a\nparticipant who expects real activity to be weak due to a more pessimistic view about the productive\ncapacity of the economy, or by a participant who expects higher inflation in the context of a stronger\nrecovery, perhaps judging, in the spirit of the optimal policy simulations, that somewhat higher inflation is\nwarranted for some time to achieve faster progress in reducing unemployment.\n\n- 22 -\nAnother alternative that deserves serious consideration would be for the\nCommittee to provide an explanation of how the calendar date guidance included in the\nstatement--currently mid-2015--relates to the outlook for the economy, which can and\nsurely will change over time. Going further, the Committee might eliminate the calendar\ndate entirely and replace it with guidance on the economic conditions that would need to\nprevail before liftoff of the federal funds rate might be judged appropriate. Several of my\nFOMC colleagues have advocated such an approach, and I am also strongly supportive.\nThe idea is to define a zone of combinations of the unemployment rate and inflation\nwithin which the FOMC would continue to hold the federal funds rate in its current, near-\nzero range. For example, Charles Evans, president of the Chicago Fed, suggests that the\nFOMC should commit to hold the federal funds rate in its current low range at least until\nunemployment has declined below 7 percent, provided that inflation over the medium\nterm remains below 3 percent. Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Minneapolis\nFed, suggests thresholds of 5.5 percent for unemployment and 2.25 percent for the\nmedium-term inflation outlook. Under such an approach, liftoff would not be automatic\nonce a threshold is reached; that decision would require further Committee deliberation\nand judgment.\nI support this approach because it would enable the public to immediately adjust\nits expectations concerning the timing of liftoff in response to new information affecting\nthe economic outlook. This market response would serve as a kind of automatic\nstabilizer for the economy: Information suggesting a weaker outlook would\nautomatically induce market participants to push out the anticipated date of tightening\nand vice versa.\n\n- 23 -\nPerhaps more importantly, the use of inflation and unemployment thresholds\nwould help the public understand whether a shift in the calendar date, assuming that one\nis still included in the statement, reflects a change in the Committee’s economic outlook\nor, alternatively, a change in its view concerning the appropriate degree of\naccommodation. Since monetary policy works in large part through the public’s\nperceptions of the FOMC’s systematic behavior, this distinction is critical.25\nConclusion\nThe past few years have seen important changes in the FOMC’s\ncommunications--innovations that promote the Federal Reserve’s accountability to the\npublic. Beyond that, I believe better communication serves to improve the efficacy of\nmonetary policy at a time when the FOMC faces constraints on its ability to provide\nappropriate support to the economic recovery through the federal funds rate, its\ntraditional policy tool. In my view, we’ve made progress, but much work remains to be\ndone.\n25 The FOMC could also, potentially, provide additional information pertaining to the economic conditions\nit would expect to justify a decision to stop, or scale back, its asset purchases. However, this decision also\ndepends on the Committee’s assessment of efficacy and costs--matters on which the Committee is still\ngaining experience.",

Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nNovember 6, 2006, 4:00 PM Pacific Standard Time\nEconomic Inequality in the United States\nGood afternoon, and thank you very much for inviting me to deliver this year's\nEconomics of Governance Lecture.1 My topic today will be the performance of the U.S.\neconomy, with a focus on how trends for the economy as a whole—in other words, at the\nmacro level—have been playing out for our nation's individuals and families. One area\nI'd like to focus on in particular is how the income that has been generated by our\neconomy over the past three decades or so has been distributed among the various income\ngroups, from the top to the bottom.\nQuestions of income inequality, of course, are not part of the Federal Reserve's\ndual mandate from Congress, which is to foster price stability and to promote maximum\nsustainable employment. Nonetheless, this has been an interest of mine for a long time,\nand not only as an academic. In addition to my years as an economics professor at U.C.\nBerkeley, I've also had several stints as a macro policymaker, first on the Federal Reserve\nBoard in Washington D.C., then on President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers,\nand now at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Much of my interest in macro\npolicy has been founded on the belief that it can and should improve the lives of the\nbroad range of our nation's people. I think of this as happening through two channels.\nFirst, policies that reduce the frequency and size of the fluctuations in business cycles can\nspare people the painful disruptions that occur during recessions, or, in the worst cases,\n1\nThese remarks reflect my own views and are not necessarily shared by my colleagues in the Federal\nReserve System.\n\ntragic events like the Great Depression of the 1930s. Second, policies that succeed in\nenhancing the long-run growth of productivity should help lift the average standard of\nliving over time.\nBy many measures, these two channels have been operating extremely well in our\neconomy for some time. In terms of the business cycle, for almost two decades we have\nbeen enjoying an era that many economists call the \"Great Moderation\"; in other words,\nrecessions have been less frequent, and the swings have been less severe, while, at the\nsame time, inflation has come down to quite moderate levels and itself has been less\nvolatile.\nProductivity trends also have been very favorable, probably in no small part\nbecause of the impact of technological advancements. Growth in labor productivity has\nbeen quite rapid for over ten years now, following more than a quarter century of\nstagnation that began in the early 1970s.\nGiven these two developments—more macro stability and more rapid labor\nproductivity growth—it is tempting to conclude that most Americans are feeling \"better\noff.\" But a glance at the newspapers suggests that this is not necessarily the case. Indeed,\npoll after poll shows that many Americans feel dissatisfied with the long-term direction\nof the economy and are worried about the future. Recent polls by the Pew Charitable\nTrust, the New York Times and CBS News, and various labor organizations indicate that\ngrowing shares of respondents feel that they and their children will experience a\ndiminished quality of life in coming years, and that, even today, working conditions are\nmarked by more insecurity and stress than they were a generation ago.2\n2 Poll results described in: Leonhardt, David, \"Anxiety Rises as Paychecks Trail Inflation,\" New York\nTimes, August 2, 2006; Greenhouse, Steven, \"Three Polls Find Workers Sensing Deep Pessimism,\" New\n\nLooking beyond the headline numbers on the macro economy provides some\nclues to the source of this discomfort. In particular, over the past three decades, much of\nthe gain from excellent macroeconomic performance has gone to just a small segment of\nthe population—those already in the upper part of the distribution. As a result, inequality\nhas grown. This inequality, coupled with increased turbulence in family incomes\nassociated with job displacement and restructuring, sheds substantial light on the sources\nof the disappointment and concern that show up in the opinion polls.\nToday I'd like to examine these trends in a bit more detail. I will start with a more\nthorough review of the facts relating to economic inequality and an assessment of some\nof the leading explanations that have been advanced. Then I will broaden my perspective\nto consider other sources of unease, namely, job displacement and income volatility.\nFinally, I will turn to some policy considerations.\nProductivity and real wages\nA natural place to begin is by looking at average real compensation, that is,\naverage wages plus benefits for an hour of work adjusted for inflation. In the U.S., the\ngrowth in average real compensation has roughly tracked growth in labor productivity,\nwhich measures the value of output per hour of work adjusted for inflation. When U.S.\nlabor productivity growth slowed sharply and unexpectedly in the early 1970s, and then\nstayed sluggish for the next 25 years, growth in average real compensation also was\nsluggish.3 Then, in the mid-1990s, labor productivity growth surprised us again, only this\ntime, thankfully, on the upside: it suddenly took a big jump up—to over 3 percent at an\nYork Times, August 31, 2006; Yeager, Holly, \"Americans suffer big fall in optimism ratings,\" Financial\nTimes, September 15, 2006.\n3 From 1972 to 1997, nonfarm labor productivity rose at only a 1.7 percent rate, while real labor\ncompensation rose at an annual rate of 1.3 percent.\n\nannual rate—and it has stayed in that vicinity ever since. As I mentioned, this\ndevelopment probably stemmed mainly from technological innovations and the huge\ninvestments businesses made to harness them for production. How has this affected\naverage real compensation growth? It has jumped, too, also hitting a 3 percent rate.4\nFrom this perspective, then, it would seem that things are looking pretty good.\nHowever, the public mood does not seem consistent with this view. To see why, we need\nto dig a little deeper. When we look at data on the distribution of real wages, which\nconstitute the bulk of compensation, we find striking evidence of increasing inequality.\nFor example, economists Robert Gordon and Ian Dew-Becker report that, from 1997 to\n2001, nearly 50 percent of productivity gains went to the top 10 percent of the\ndistribution.5 Importantly, they find roughly the same pattern going back more than thirty\nyears.\nWage inequality\nAs Figure 1 shows, from 1973 to 2005, real hourly wages of those in the 90th\npercentile—where most people have college or advanced degrees—rose by 30 percent or\nmore. As I will discuss later, among this top 10 percent, the growth was heavily\nconcentrated at the very tip of the top, that is, the top 1 percent.6 This includes the people\nwho earn the very highest salaries in the U.S. economy, like sports and entertainment\n4 Despite the widespread view that labor's share of total income has fallen as capital's share has gone up,\nthere actually was no net change in these shares over 1997-2005, although there were fluctuations during\nthe period.\n5\nDew-Becker, Ian, and Robert J. Gordon, \"Where Did the Productivity Growth Go? Inflation Dynamics\nand the Distribution of Income,\" Brookings Papers on Economic Activity 2 (2005) pp. 67-127.\n6 Piketty, Thomas, and Emmanuel Saez, \"The Evolution of Top Incomes: A Historical and International\nPerspective,\" American Economic Review 96 (2, May 2006), pp. 200-205.\n\nstars, investment bankers and venture capitalists, corporate attorneys, and CEOs. In\ncontrast, at the 50th percentile and below—where many people have at most a high school\ndiploma—real wages rose by only 5 to 10 percent.7\nWhat I've described so far is the big picture for wage inequality—the major\nchange over three decades. However, an interesting twist on the story has occurred during\nthe last decade, when rapid productivity growth raised the real wages of workers\nthroughout the distribution for the first time since the 1960s. During this period, as Figure\n1 illustrates, real wages of the lowest earners—the 10th percentile—actually rose\nsomewhat faster than those in the middle of the distribution. The consequence was that\nwage inequality among those in the bottom half of the distribution, which had been\nwidening throughout the 1980s, diminished during the 1990s. At the same time, real\nwages at the upper end continued to soar.8\nWhat explains the rising economic inequality?\nAlthough there are a variety of ways to explain trends in wage inequality, perhaps\nno cut at the data has been more revealing than the differences in real wages by\neducation. As Figure 2 shows, since the early 1980s, the wage gap between college\ngraduates and those with a high school education or less has widened dramatically; the\ngap between high school graduates and non-graduates also has widened, but less so. Thus\nit appears that the demand for college educated workers has outstripped the supply.9\n7 The broad trends in inequality described in this paragraph are also observed for men and women analyzed\nseparately.\n8 The basic story about inequality in real wages does not change if one broadens the analysis to include\nbenefits or if one examines earnings or family income.\n9 The demand for skilled workers was growing during the 1970s as well. But back then, a surge of \"baby-\nboom\" college graduates, together with a rise in labor force participation among educated women, largely\nmet that demand and helped to keep their relative wages from rising rapidly. In contrast, during the 1980s,\n\nWhile rising returns to education at the upper end of the distribution led to a pickup in\ncollege enrollment, the increase in supply has not been sufficient to reduce the wage gap\nbetween college and high school educated workers.\nIt's important to recognize, however, that shifts in the return to education and the\neducational attainment of the workforce cannot fully explain the evolution of inequality\nover the last thirty years because, even within groups with the same level of education,\nthe gap between high and low earners has widened too. Indeed, the more advanced the\ndegree, the wider the gap becomes. A satisfactory theory must therefore explain not only\nwhy the demand for college educated workers has risen but also why \"residual\"\ninequality has increased, that is, the part that is unexplained by education and other\nobservable factors.\nSkill-biased technological change\nA primary explanation has focused on the impact of technology. Over the past\nthree decades, many sectors of the economy have undergone fundamental change as a\nresult of technological advancement, most notably the enormous investments in\ncomputers and related technologies. These technologies have changed what workers need\nto know to do their work, and, indeed, they have changed the nature of the work itself. As\na result, there is a greater demand for, and a greater payoff to, workers who have the\nconceptual and organizational skills to use these technologies most effectively. The\nnecessary skills are more prevalent among college educated workers, so they are in\ngreater demand. However, even among workers with equal educational attainment, skills\ndiffer.\nthe \"baby bust\" slowed the flow of new college graduates onto the market at a time when some believe that\nthe demand for skilled labor was actually accelerating.\n\nFor example, consider two college graduates with liberal arts degrees: the one\nwho has the skills to use computer power to collect, analyze, and synthesize data may\nhave a distinct edge in the labor market over the other who lacks those skills. Similarly, a\nmachinist with a high school diploma who can use computers effectively will tend to earn\nmore than a coworker who is a technophobe.\nThis explanation is summed up in the literature by the term \"skill-biased\ntechnological change.\" It explains the increased demand for and rising wages of highly\neducated workers and also rising \"residual\" inequality because skill differences exist not\nonly across but also within educational groupings. These skill differences are observed by\nemployers and rewarded in the marketplace, but unobservable to researchers.\nGlobalization\nA related factor accounting for rising inequality is the increasing globalization of\nlabor markets. The most basic way in which globalization might affect inequality is\nthrough trade, which has raised substantially both imports and exports as a share of GDP.\nSince the U.S. tends to export goods that use skilled labor intensively and to import\ngoods that use less-skilled labor intensively, increased trade has, on balance, raised the\ndemand for skilled labor and reduced the demand for less-skilled workers in this country.\nIn the 1980s, the impact of globalization was especially pronounced for previously well-\npaid manufacturing jobs available to U.S. workers possessing a high school degree or\nless. The result has been job losses and excess supply of low-skilled workers, a situation\nthat has been intensified by an influx of immigrants with less than a high school\neducation.\n\nCertainly, globalization has been a factor in the downsizing of several industries\nthat employ less-skilled workers—apparel is a good example. And it may account for part\nof the increase in inequality over the last thirty years. But it surely can't be the whole\nstory because, for much of the past thirty years, the shift in employment toward an\nincreasingly skilled workforce has occurred across a wide range of industries, whether\nthey were affected by global trade or not. The logical conclusion is that skill-biased\ntechnological change has been a dominant force operative across the industrial spectrum.\nIn recent years, globalization and skill-biased technological change may have\nbeen working in combination to particularly depress the wage gains of those in the\nmiddle of the U.S. wage distribution, accounting for the twist in the trend that I\nmentioned earlier. The explanation goes like this. The surge in the use of new\ntechnologies that began in the mid-1990s led to major changes in the way business was\nconducted and organized within the U.S. and globally. Technological change and\nglobalization, especially outsourcing, complemented the skills of highly able workers\nperforming non-routine work requiring problem-solving skills. This explains the\ncontinued rapid increase in real wages at the top of the distribution. In the middle of the\ndistribution, however, technology and globalization had the opposite effect—substituting\nfor workers performing routine or repetitive tasks and depressing their wages. At the\nbottom of the distribution, these developments have had little impact during the last\ndecade. By that time, many low-wage jobs that could be eliminated by technology had\nalready vanished. Most of the remaining low-wage jobs involve manual and service work\nthat cannot easily be automated. This may explain why, as I said, wages in the middle not\n\nonly rose far more slowly than those at the top, they also rose more slowly than those at\nthe bottom of the distribution during the 1990s.\nLet me elaborate with an example from the technology side. Take the accounting\nprofession. Computers and telecommunications technologies have increased wages for\naccountants, who tend to be at the top end of the distribution. In contrast, in the middle of\nthe distribution are workers like bookkeepers, who are being replaced by technology. At\nthe lower end, the labor market has already largely adjusted to the impact of skill-biased\ntechnological change. Therefore, the wages of those workers, who perform manual tasks\nin sectors like business services—janitorial work is an example—are now largely\nuntouched by computers.10\nGlobalization in combination with advances in technology, especially\ncommunications technology, leads to similar patterns. At the upper end, it has boosted\ndemand for those who have the skills to manage large, complex, global operations. In\ncontrast, an increasing share of domestic jobs in the middle of the wage spectrum has\nexperienced lower demand because companies can now look all over the world for\nworkers able to perform computer programming tasks, communications tasks, and similar\njobs—even medical services. At the same time, such outsourcing is far less feasible for\nmanual jobs and for service jobs that require face-to-face interactions and lie at the low\nend of the wage distribution.\n10Autor, David H., Lawrence F. Katz, and Melissa S. Kearney, \"The Polarization of the U.S. Labor\nMarket,\" American Economic Review 96 (2, May 2006), pp. 189-194. Autor, David H., Frank Levy, and\nRichard J. Murnane, \"The Skill Content of Recent Technological Change: An Empirical Exploration,\"\nQuarterly Journal of Economics 118(4, 2003), pp. 1279–1333.\n\nThe top one percent\nThese changes in technology and growing globalization go a long way towards\nexplaining the inequality trends I have described. And there certainly are other factors\nthat have also likely played a role. For example, the fall in the real value of the minimum\nwage appears to have especially depressed the wages of low-skilled women, while\ndeclines in unionization particularly impacted the wages of less-skilled men. However,\nnone of these factors provides a complete and compelling explanation for the rapid\ngrowth of real wages at the very top of the distribution, the top 1 percent, which,\naccording to IRS data, doubled between 1972 and 2001.11\nThe market forces of changing technology and rising globalization, broadly\nunderstood, may matter to some degree for this group. For example, these forces have\nsubstantially increased the size of the markets that American companies serve. This has,\nin turn, increased the impact of individuals who are at the very top end of the talent and\nskill distributions—and who tend to be in very short supply. These individuals include\nso-called superstars, such as top entertainers and athletes, highly successful investment\nbankers and venture capitalists, and perhaps CEOs, although the latter point is hotly\ndebated. For example, people had a high demand to see Michael Jordan perform—far\nhigher than the demand for even a large number of average NBA players—and\ntechnology enabled his performances to be broadcast to a very large worldwide audience\n11 Dew-Becker and Gordon (2005). Piketty and Saez (2006) show that in 2001 the top 1 percent of the\nincome distribution held 15.4 percent of total income.\n\nat relatively low cost. It's not surprising that he, and other superstars, could earn very\nlarge incomes.12\nThe superstar argument is less clear-cut with CEO salaries, in part because a\nCEO's contribution to the bottom line of a corporation is difficult to measure. Some argue\nthat CEO compensation has been driven up by market forces, like the large increase in\nthe size of many American companies, which increases the potential benefit of hiring the\nright CEO from the limited pool of candidates.13\nAnother possible explanation is the so-called \"tournament\" model, in which the\nCEO's direct contribution to the bottom line is not so much of an issue. This model\nsuggests that large pay differentials for those at the top of an organization function as\nincentives for lower-ranked executives to compete for those positions, in other words, to\nwork harder in order to win the top spots themselves one day. The resulting increase in\neffort generates benefits for the company that go well beyond the direct contribution\nmade by the CEO.14\nWhile such competitive factors may matter, I cannot ignore the concerns that have\nbeen raised of late regarding corporate standards for executive pay-setting. Some\nobservers have argued that corporate boards are increasingly beholden to the CEOs\nwhose salaries they determine; as a result, CEO salaries may be inadequately monitored\nand sometimes set higher than market conditions or company performance merits. Critics\nof rising executive compensation also have pointed to inappropriate reliance on\n12 Rosen, Sherwin, \"The Economics of Superstars,\" American Economic Review 71(5, 1981), pp. 845-858.\n13 Gabaix, Xavier, and Augustin Landier, \"Why Has CEO Pay Increased So Much?\" NBER Working Paper\n12365, July 2006.\n14 Lazear, Edward P., and Sherwin Rosen, \"Rank-Order Tournaments as Optimum Labor Contracts,\"\nJournal of Political Economy 89 (5, Oct. 1981), pp. 841-864.\n\ncompensation schemes that hide payments from shareholders and the market—for\nexample, the backdating of stock options for top executives, which increases executive\npayouts without properly reflecting the resulting costs in corporate balance sheets. The\nhidden nature of these payouts may reflect an imbalance in the setting of executive pay\nrelative to shareholder returns and worker pay more generally. Issues like these quite\nnaturally raise concerns for the public and contribute to feelings of dissatisfaction.\nJob displacement and income instability\nAnother contributor to feelings of discontent is the perception that job stability\nhas declined. Globalization and technology appear to have played roles in these trends as\nwell, since they represent changing market conditions that are causing dislocations in\nprevious patterns of labor demand.\nIt's important to note first that our economy is always subject to large amounts of\njob turnover. Indeed, this is one hallmark of a dynamic, flexible economy, and it is not\nnecessarily a bad thing on net. Data on worker flows—movements into and out of jobs—\nindicate that about 1 out of 3 job matches are dissolved each year, with a comparable rate\nof worker matching to new jobs.15 Over half of this job churning is voluntary in nature,\nreflecting worker desires to find a job with higher wages, better working conditions, or a\ndifferent location. Moreover, the degree of job creation and destruction has declined\nsomewhat over the past 15 years, creating a picture of a more stable labor market.\nHowever, involuntary displacement from permanent jobs, due to layoffs or\ndownsizing, is important and has been on the rise over the past two decades. In particular,\nrates of worker displacement are up relative to measures of overall labor market\n15 Davis, Steven J., R. Jason Faberman, and John Haltiwanger, \"The Flow Approach to Labor Markets:\nNew Data Sources and Micro-Macro Links,\" NBER Working Paper 12167, April 2006.\n\nconditions, such as the unemployment rate. For example, in the 2001 recession, which\nwas relatively short and shallow, there was about as much worker displacement as in the\nearly 1980s, when the economy went through the biggest recession in post-war\nhistory.16,17\nIn addition, the distribution of displacement has shifted towards the highly\neducated: workers holding a college degree saw nearly a 50 percent increase in their\ndisplacement rates between the early 1980s recession and the most recent one in 2001,\nwhile workers with a high school degree or less actually saw a slight decline in\ndisplacement rates. So, more educated workers are seeing erosion of their job security\nrelative to their less-educated counterparts. Of course, job displacement still remains a\nmore significant issue for low-paid workers, but the instability that they have always\nfaced has increasingly spread to higher-income groups.\nInvoluntary job loss frequently inflicts dire consequences, which have grown\nmore severe over time. Involuntary job losers typically are unemployed for at least four\nmonths, about 70 percent longer than individuals who enter unemployment voluntarily.\nAs such, the rising share of permanent job losers among the overall unemployed has\nhelped keep the typical length of an unemployment spell stubbornly high over the past\nfew decades.18 The picture looks even gloomier when you recognize that some job losers\n16 Displacement rates: 12.8% in 1981-1983, 11.8% in 2001-2003. Unemployment rates: 9.0% in 1981-\n1983, 5.2% in 2001-2003.\n17 The job displacement figures in this paragraph and wage loss figures in the next paragraph are from\nHenry S. Farber, \"What Do We Know about Job Loss in the United States? Evidence from the Displaced\nWorkers Survey, 1984-2004,\" Working Paper #498, Industrial Relations Section, Princeton University,\nJanuary 2005.\n18 Valletta, Robert G., \"Rising Unemployment Duration in the United States: Causes and Consequences,\"\nmanuscript, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, May 2005.\n\nwithdraw from the labor force and are no longer counted as unemployed, so their\nobserved unemployment spells understate the severity of the jobless experience. Put these\nfactors together and it's clear that periods without earnings can be quite lengthy and\ncostly for job losers. Moreover, when displaced workers do find new jobs, they're taking\na pay cut of about 17 percent on average. The size of this wage loss in the early 2000s\nwas the highest in at least 20 years.\nJob displacement also has adverse consequences for health insurance coverage.\nResearch shows that job loss substantially reduces access to health insurance over\nextended time periods, and this effect is only partially offset by federal COBRA\nguidelines, which require employers to make continued coverage available—at its full\ncost—to separated employees.19 The connection between displacement and the loss of\ninsurance coverage reinforces a more general trend towards declining coverage through\nemployment-based health insurance programs. For example, between 2000 and 2005,\nhealth coverage through employer-based programs fell about 4 percent nationwide,\nrepresenting a loss of health insurance for several million Americans that was only\npartially offset by increased coverage through government-provided insurance.20\nGiven the increase in job displacement and earnings losses that I described above,\nit is not surprising that yearly fluctuations in individual earnings and family incomes have\n19 Gruber, Jonathan, and Brigitte Madrian, \"Employment Separation and Health Insurance Coverage,\"\nJournal of Public Economics 66, 1997, pp. 349-382.\n20 Buchmueller, Thomas, and Robert G. Valletta, \"Health Insurance Costs and Declining Coverage,\"\nFRBSF Economic Letter 2006-25, Sept. 29, 2006. Between 2000 and 2005, coverage through employment-\nbased plans fell from 63.6% to 59.5%, while coverage through government programs rose from 24.7% to\n27.3%. The decline in the actual number of individuals covered through employer-provided insurance was\nabout 3 million; absent employment and population growth, the decline would have been about 11.5\nmillion. For exact numbers, see Carmen DeNavas-Walt, Bernadette D. Proctor, and Cheryl Hill Lee,\n\"Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2005,\" U.S. Census Bureau,\nCurrent Population Reports P60-231, Appendix Table C-1.\n\nincreased sharply since the 1970s.21 Indeed, between the 1970s and the early 2000s, the\ngaps between the highs and lows in a typical family's yearly income have risen\nsubstantially. That is, in the 1970s, a typical family might have seen its income vary from\na high of $60,000 to a low of $30,000 over the decade, while in the more recent decade a\nfamily seeing that same high would tend to see a low of about $15,000. Among families\nseeing declines in annual income, the size of the typical loss has increased: for example,\nthe chances that an American family will see at least a 50 percent drop in its yearly\nincome has more than doubled since the early 1970s, rising to about one in six families in\nrecent years.\nThe increased risk associated with these income fluctuations is likely to reduce\nperceived well-being quite substantially, even if family incomes on average are growing\nover time. As with the risk of job loss, these income risks are most severe for less-\neducated Americans. However, during the 1990s, income instability rose relatively more\nfor families with high educational achievement, consistent with the spread of involuntary\njob loss to highly educated individuals.\nPolicy options\nMy focus thus far has been on the problems facing Americans in the labor market\nand not on potential solutions. It is natural to ask, then, whether anything can be done to\nalter these disquieting trends. Since technology and globalization have been identified\nwith growing inequality, it might seem natural to look at these areas for possible\nsolutions. While I sometimes feel like smashing my own computer, I wouldn't\nrecommend this as a national policy! However, it's not uncommon to hear proposals to\n21 Hacker, Jacob S., The Great Risk Shift, New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 2006.\n\nput up barriers to trade as a way to mitigate economic disruption and inequality. I don't\nthink that is the way to go. By providing for specialization in production across countries,\ntrade enhances the size of the economic \"pie\" here and abroad, and in doing so, enhances\noverall economic welfare. I think we should look to other policy tools to address\ninequality, and I will attempt to provide a useful overview of some key considerations.\nI will begin with education. There can be little doubt that programs that support\ninvestment in education, broadly conceived, are worthwhile. Increasing skill has been a\nsignificant source of productivity growth. Moreover, since the gap between the earnings\nof workers with more and less skill in part represents the return to education, a widening\nof that gap clearly signals the need for such investment to increase the supply of higher-\nskilled workers.\nBut investment in education takes resources, which complicates the debate: the\nresources are limited and to a large degree should be directed to where they will pay the\nhighest return. At the college level, one possibility is just to \"let the market work.\" If\ncollege pays off, more young people will enroll. Indeed, the rising returns to education at\nthe upper end of the earnings distribution did precede an increase in college attendance\nthrough the mid-1990s, suggesting that market forces may have worked as expected.\nSince then, however, despite further growth in the returns to college and advanced\ndegrees, college attendance has flattened out. For example, enrollment rates among recent\nhigh school graduates hovered around 65 percent between 1996 and 2004, after\nincreasing noticeably in the preceding decade.22\nDoes this imply that the highest priority for public funding for education should\n22 National Center for Education Statistics (NCES):\nhttp://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d05/tables/dt05_181.asp\n\nbe the college level? Not necessarily. There certainly is a lot of public discussion by\neducators and politicians about problems with the quality of K-through-12 education in\nthe U.S., and international comparisons show that American students rank relatively low\non standardized tests in science and math, the very kinds of skills that earn higher\nrewards.\nBut there is yet another contender for the scarce public funding for education.\nRecently, researchers led by James Heckman from the University of Chicago have argued\nthat these funds should be targeted at even younger children.23 Family background\nfactors are critically important in student achievement, and recent evidence suggests that\nthe cognitive and social skills associated with college attendance are developed very early\nin life. Moreover, skill acquisition is a cumulative process that works most effectively\nwhen a solid foundation has been provided in early childhood. As such, programs to\nsupport early childhood development, such as preschool programs for disadvantaged\nchildren, not only appear to have substantial payoffs early but also are likely to continue\npaying off throughout the life cycle.\nBut what about struggling adults, especially those who find that their skills have\nbecome outmoded due to technological change or globalization? Should the highest\npriority for public funding of education be the expansion of federally subsidized\nretraining programs, such as those associated with the Job Training Partnership Act, the\nComprehensive Employment and Training Act, and the Job Corps program for\ndisadvantaged youth? Some researchers, such as Alan Krueger of Princeton University,\nview the outcomes of these programs as evidence that training investments often have\n23 Carneiro, Pedro, and James Heckman, \"Human Capital Policy,\" in Inequality in America: What Role for\nHuman Capital Policies? edited by Benjamin M. Friedman (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2003).\n\nhigh returns, especially for the economically disadvantaged, who cannot finance\neducational and training investments on their own.24\nProponents of this view argue that these programs, which have been sharply\ncurtailed over the past few decades, should be revived. In contrast, Heckman and others,\nlooking at the same evidence, note the high cost of these programs relative to early\nchildhood interventions and K-through-12 education, implying that retraining is\nfinancially unsound on a large scale. At this point, then, the evidence is unclear regarding\nthe exact conditions under which adult education and retraining programs are cost-\neffective. However, it seems reasonable to consider providing workers buffeted by\npowerful economic forces a fair shot at retooling and finding new careers.\nBeyond education and training, the United States has long deployed an array of\npolicy tools to combat inequality and diminish economic insecurity. One example is the\nearned income tax credit, which supplements the earnings of low income workers.\nUnemployment and disability insurance cushion family income in the face of job loss and\nillness, while Social Security shelters many elderly households from poverty. Indeed,\ninequality in consumption among U.S. families is notably lower than inequality in pre-tax\nincome due to these programs and others that involve the direct provision of services\nsuch as healthcare, housing, childcare, and food stamps to families in need. The real\nquestion is whether government should and can do more.\nTo assess the value of and potential need for additional government intervention,\nit is instructive to draw some comparisons between the U.S. and other countries. In\nregard to inequality, over the past few decades it has risen more in the U.S. than in most\n24 Krueger, Alan B., \"Inequality, Too Much of a Good Thing,\" in Inequality in America: What Role for\nHuman Capital Policies? edited by Benjamin M. Friedman (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2003).\n\nother advanced industrial countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment, or OECD. Indeed, by most measures, the U.S. ranks near the top (some\nmight say the bottom) in terms of household income inequality. The inequality gap in the\nUnited States is associated with higher levels of overall and child poverty relative to a\nmajority of OECD countries.25\nThis high and growing level of relative inequality in the U.S. reflects, in part,\ndifferences in the \"social safety net.\" Among the 30 OECD countries, the U.S. ranks\nabove only Mexico, Korea, and Ireland in gross public social expenditures as a share of\nGDP spending, and it does the least to target government taxes and transfers towards\nmoving families out of poverty. Not surprisingly, outcomes such as infant mortality and\nlife expectancy are worse in the U.S. than in most advanced industrial countries. As for\nworkplace protections, unemployment insurance in the United States replaces a smaller\nshare of income and offers benefits of shorter duration, while the minimum wage is quite\nlow relative to average wages in the U.S. Moreover, U.S. firms face far fewer restrictions\nin their ability to fire or lay off workers than do firms in most other OECD countries.\nOther countries' efforts to mitigate inequality and provide a safety net may come\nat a price, however, since these efforts may hinder job growth and intensify\nunemployment, especially for young and less-skilled workers. Indeed, over the past two\ndecades, unemployment rates generally have been higher in other advanced countries\nthan in the U.S. Heeding this lesson, some European countries have recently taken steps\nto reduce the distortions associated with generous social insurance programs and\nemployment protections. For example, some are following the U.S. lead, placing less\n25 The OECD defines poverty as the share of households that receive 50 percent or less of the median\nincome in each country and takes account of household size, cash transfers, taxes, and tax credits.\n\nemphasis on policies that discourage hiring and more on programs like the earned income\ntax credit. By contrast, the U.S. has done little to move closer to the European model of\nsocial protections and the reduction of inequality and poverty.\nConclusion\nThis comparison of the U.S. and other advanced industrialized countries, though\njust a sketch, is suggestive. The possible responses to rising inequality do not boil down\nto \"either/or\" kinds of solutions. Rather, these responses range along a fairly wide\ncontinuum, reflecting the tradeoffs that policymakers face between efficiency and equity.\nCertainly some market-determined income differences are needed to create incentives to\nwork, invest, and take risks. However, there are signs that rising inequality is intensifying\nresistance to globalization, impairing social cohesion, and could, ultimately, undermine\nAmerican democracy. Improvements in education are an imperative for reducing\ninequality and an easily justifiable investment, given its high social return. In contrast,\nimprovements in the social safety net entail costs, even when policy interventions are\nwell-designed from an efficiency standpoint. Even so, in my opinion, they deserve high\npolicy priority. Inequality has risen to the point that it seems to me worthwhile for the\nU.S. to seriously consider taking the risk of making our economy more rewarding for\nmore of the people.\n\nFi gure 1: Real Hourly Wages for Selected Percentiles\n(all workers, normalized; 1973=100)\n140\n95th 135\n130\n90th\n125\n80th\n120\n115\n110\n105\n50th\n100\n20th\n95\n10th\n90\n1973 1976 1979 1982 1985 1988 1991 1994 1997 2000 2003\nSource: Economic Policy Institute\nFigure 2: Real Hourly Wages by Education\n(all workers, normalized; 1973=100)\n130\n120\nAdv.

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nStanford Institute for Economic Policy Research\nStanford University\nStanford, California\nJanuary 19, 2017\n\nIt is a privilege to be here today to discuss how the Federal Reserve is conducting\nmonetary policy to promote a healthy economy. For more than 30 years, research from\nthe Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research has informed economic policy, and\nevents such as this one have helped foster debate among scholars, policymakers, business\nleaders, and members of the public on critical economic issues facing our nation. I\nappreciate the opportunity to participate.\nIn my remarks today, I will review the considerable progress the economy has\nmade toward the attainment of the two objectives that the Congress has assigned to the\nFederal Reserve--maximum employment and price stability. The upshot is that labor\nutilization is close to its estimated longer-run normal level, and we are closing in on our\n2 percent inflation objective. I will then discuss the prospects for adjusting monetary\npolicy in the manner needed to sustain a strong job market while maintaining low and\nstable inflation. Determining how best to adjust the federal funds rate over time to\nachieve these objectives will not be easy. For that reason, in the balance of my remarks, I\nwill discuss some considerations that will help inform our decisions, including the\nguidance provided by simple policy rules. I will conclude by touching on some key\nuncertainties affecting the outlook.\nProgress to Date\nMy assessment of progress to date will begin with the labor market. Since the\ndepths of the Great Recession, about 15-1/2 million jobs have been added to the U.S.\neconomy, on net. In 2016, job gains averaged about 180,000 per month, well above the\npace of 75,000 to 125,000 per month that is probably consistent with keeping the\n\n- 2 -\nunemployment rate stable over the longer run.1 The unemployment rate is now close to\nestimates of its longer-run normal level, and other measures of labor utilization have\nimproved appreciably. As shown in figure 1, a broader measure of labor\nunderutilization--the U-6 measure, which includes not only the unemployed but also\npeople working part time who would like full-time employment and those who would\nlike a job but are not actively looking--has retraced nearly all of the steep run-up that\noccurred as a result of the recession.2\nOther indicators also support the view that the labor market has largely recovered\nfrom the severe downturn that occurred in the wake of the financial crisis. As illustrated\nby the red dashed line in figure 2, the quits rate--an indicator of workers’ confidence\nabout leaving an existing job to pursue new opportunities--is nearly back to its pre-\nrecession level. And some indicators, such as small businesses’ assessments of the\ndifficulty of hiring, shown by the solid black line, as well as the average length of time it\ntakes firms to fill vacancies and the job openings rate, even suggest that the labor market\nis a bit tighter than before the financial crisis. Of course, both the labor force\nparticipation rate and the employment-to-population ratio are still much lower than they\nwere a decade ago. But the cyclical element in these declines looks to have largely\ndisappeared, and what is left seems to mostly reflect the aging of the population and other\nsecular trends.3 Based on this array of labor market indicators, I judge labor utilization to\nbe reasonably close to its normal longer-run level while also recognizing that estimates of\n1 The sustainable longer-run pace of payroll employment growth depends on a number of a factors, such as\nthe growth rate of the working-age population, trend movements in labor force participation, and the\nprevalence of self-employment and multiple job holdings, so it cannot be predicted with precision.\n2 The normal level of the U-6 measure may now be somewhat higher than it was prior to the financial crisis\nbecause of a trend toward greater reliance on part-time workers in many sectors. See Golden (2016).\n3 See Aaronson and others (2014).\n\n- 3 -\nthe sustainable levels of the unemployment rate and the employment-to-population ratio\nare inherently imprecise.4\nIn the coming months, I expect some further strengthening in labor market\nconditions as the economy continues to expand at a moderate pace--a view that is shared\nby most of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).5 Overall\neconomic growth has been driven by consumer spending, which has been bolstered by\nsubstantial gains in household income and wealth. Business investment, in contrast, has\nbeen soft. But recent readings on business sentiment and new orders for equipment are\nconsistent with the view that capital spending will likely strengthen modestly this year;\nanother positive factor is that oil drilling, which plummeted after oil prices fell sharply\nback in late 2014, has recently begun to pick up. As we look to broader trends, gross\ndomestic product (GDP) growth has been restrained in recent years by a variety of forces\ndepressing both supply and demand, including slow labor force and productivity growth,\nweak growth abroad, and lingering headwinds from the financial crisis. Although I am\ncautiously optimistic that some of these forces will abate over time, I anticipate that they\nwill continue to restrain overall growth over the medium term, likely holding down the\nlevel of interest rates consistent with stable labor market conditions.\nTurning to inflation, we are now much closer to the FOMC’s 2 percent objective\nthan we were just a year ago. Prices, as measured by the index for personal consumption\nexpenditures (PCE), rose nearly 1-1/2 percent in the 12 months ending in November, as\n4 In addition, a persistently strong labor market could potentially lead some firms to rely less on part-time\nworkers, or might encourage some people to rejoin the labor force who would otherwise sit on the\nsidelines. However, evidence on these sorts of endogenous supply-side effects is rather limited, as I noted\nin a recent speech (see Yellen, 2016).\n5 A summary of the projections submitted by Committee participants for the December 2016 FOMC\nmeeting can be found at www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20161214.htm.\n\n- 4 -\ncompared with only 1/2 percent during 2015. Moreover, core PCE inflation--a better\nindicator of the underlying inflation trend--picked up 1/4 percentage point, to a little over\n1-1/2 percent. This rise in inflation was anticipated and largely represents a fading of the\neffects of earlier declines in energy prices and the prices of non-energy imports. In\naddition, slack in labor and product markets is no longer placing downward pressure on\ninflation, in contrast to the situation only a few years ago when the unemployment rate\nwas still quite elevated. Barring future major swings in oil prices and the foreign\nexchange value of the dollar, inflation is likely to move up to 2 percent over the next\ncouple of years, aided by a strong labor market.\nIn light of the progress that has been achieved toward our employment and\ninflation objectives and the Committee’s assessment of the outlook, the FOMC raised the\ntarget range for the federal funds rate at its December meeting by 25 basis points, to\nbetween 50 and 75 basis points. The Committee judges, however, that the stance of\nmonetary policy remains modestly accommodative, and so policy should support some\nfurther strengthening in labor market conditions and thus the return of inflation to our 2\npercent goal.\nMaintaining Sustainable Growth in a Context of Price Stability\nWith the unemployment rate near its longer-run normal level and likely to move a\nbit lower this year, a natural question is whether monetary policy has fallen behind the\ncurve. The short answer, I believe, is “no.” It is true that many employers report\ndifficulties in finding qualified workers in selected occupations, and that more workers\nare comfortable quitting jobs to take or look for better positions. But this is to be\n\n- 5 -\nexpected in a healthy labor market and not evidence that the economy as a whole is\nexperiencing a serious worker shortage.\nThe recent behavior of wages provides additional evidence pertaining to the\ndegree of labor market slack. As shown in figure 3, increases in average hourly earnings,\nthe employment cost index, and compensation per hour remain subdued, picking up only\nmodestly of late.6 Again, these data do not seem consistent with an overheated labor\nmarket. Moreover, signs of overheating in the broader economy are also scarce. For\nexample, capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector is well below its historical\naverage. Most importantly, although core inflation is rising gradually from a low level,\nthis increase mainly reflects the waning of the effects of earlier movements in the dollar,\nnot upward pressure from resource utilization.\nOf course, even if the labor market is not overheated currently, one might worry\nthat overheating could rapidly emerge as labor market conditions strengthen further,\ncausing inflation to surge. I consider this unlikely for several reasons. First, the pace of\nlabor market improvement has slowed appreciably in the past couple of years: For\nexample, average payroll gains moderated from 250,000 per month in 2014 to 180,000\nlast year, and the unemployment rate declined 1-3/4 percentage points cumulatively over\n6 An exception to this pattern is the Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker (WGT), which does show a\nnoticeable acceleration in hourly wages as self-reported in the Current Population Survey. Like average\nhourly earnings, the WGT excludes benefits costs and so is less comprehensive than the ECI or business-\nsector compensation per hour (CPH). In addition, the WGT is based on a smaller sample than the measures\nshown in Figure 3 and it only covers a sub-set of the workforce--specifically, employed individuals who\nwere also employed a year ago, and whose earnings are less than $150,000 per year. Finally, because\naverage hourly earnings and business-sector CPH are measured as total wages divided by total hours, an\nincrease in wages for high earners has a larger effect in those measures than a similarly proportioned\nincrease for lower-wage workers, and this is not so for the WGT.\n\n- 6 -\n2014 and 2015, compared with only 1/4 percentage point last year.7 Second, economic\ngrowth more broadly seems unlikely to pick up markedly in the near term given the\nongoing restraint from weak foreign demand and other factors that I mentioned,\nparticularly in an environment in which monetary policy is likely to become gradually\nless accommodative. Finally, figure 4 illustrates the relationship over the past several\ndecades between labor market pressures and core inflation. Note that during periods\nwhen the unemployment rate fell below the Congressional Budget Office’s estimate of its\nnormal long-run level, shown by the yellow shaded regions, core inflation, the solid red\nline, rose little, if at all. This stability is especially marked since inflation expectations\nbecame anchored during the mid-to-late 1990s.8\nThat said, I think that allowing the economy to run markedly and persistently\n“hot” would be risky and unwise. Waiting too long to remove accommodation could\ncause inflation expectations to begin ratcheting up, driving actual inflation higher and\nmaking it harder to control. The combination of persistently low interest rates and strong\nlabor market conditions could lead to undesirable increases in leverage and other\nfinancial imbalances, although such risks would likely take time to emerge.9 Finally,\n7 Many other labor market indicators also improved more slowly in 2016 relative to the pace seen in the\nprior two years, including the U-6 measure of labor utilization, the rates of job openings, hiring and quits,\nsurvey readings on net hiring plans and the difficulty of filling vacancies, and the average duration of\nunemployment. A notable exception to this general pattern is the labor force participation rate, which\ndeclined fairly steadily from 2007 through 2015 but then flattened out last year despite continuing\ndownward pressure from the aging of the population and other factors. However, improvements in labor\nmarket conditions along this dimension arguably reflect an increase in potential output, and so they are\nprobably not a source of inflationary pressures.\n8 During the late 1960s through the 1970s, however, inflation did rise noticeably whenever the\nunemployment rate moved below its longer-run normal level, primarily because the Federal Reserve did\nnot adequately check persistent movements in inflation by tightening monetary policy, thereby allowing\ninflation expectations to drift. This experience illustrates the importance of keeping inflation expectations\nanchored through systematic policy actions.\n9 The Federal Reserve closely monitors a wide range of indicators of financial stability, which currently\nprovide little evidence of significant increases in leverage or rapid growth in credit. However, some asset\n\n- 7 -\nwaiting too long to tighten policy could require the FOMC to eventually raise interest\nrates rapidly, which could risk disrupting financial markets and pushing the economy into\nrecession. For these reasons, I consider it prudent to adjust the stance of monetary policy\ngradually over time--a strategy that should improve the prospects that the economy will\nachieve sustainable growth with the labor market operating at full employment and\ninflation running at about 2 percent.\nEvaluating the Appropriate Stance of Monetary Policy\nAchieving these goals could prove challenging, however, even if the economy\nmanages to avoid being hit with adverse shocks over the next few years. To sustain a\nstrong job market with inflation at our 2 percent objective, policy must gradually shift\ntoward a neutral stance, where “neutral” is defined as a level of the federal funds rate that\nis neither expansionary nor contractionary when the economy is operating near its\npotential. But what level of the federal funds rate is neutral at the present time? How\nquickly should the funds rate target move up to this neutral level? And how will the\nneutral rate itself evolve over time?\nTo help answer such questions, the FOMC considers a voluminous amount of\ninformation concerning many factors, including financial markets and credit availability,\nlabor market conditions and overall economic activity, wages and prices, and foreign\neconomic developments. The FOMC also evaluates forecasts from a range of economic\nmodels, assessments of key risks to the outlook, and detailed analyses of how different\nmonetary policy strategies would affect projected outcomes and risks. Among the\nvaluations, particularly for commercial real estate, are high. With regard to the linkages between labor\nutilization and financial stability, my interpretation of the historical evidence is that undesirable increases in\nleverage or the emergence of asset bubbles are not the inevitable consequence of tight labor markets per se.\n\n- 8 -\nstrategies routinely considered by the Committee are the recommendations of a variety of\nsimple monetary policy rules. In addition, FOMC participants prepare individual\nprojections on a quarterly basis of the most likely paths of key macroeconomic variables\nunder their own assessments of “appropriate monetary policy,” together with their\nestimates of the normal longer-run values of the federal funds rate, the unemployment\nrate, and GDP growth.10 Armed with this wealth of information, the Committee as a\nwhole then decides on the most appropriate policy action to adopt at each of its meetings.\nSuch a comprehensive, forward-looking approach to policymaking is similar to that\nemployed at other central banks.11\nFigure 5 shows a plot of FOMC participants’ most recent assessments of the\nappropriate path for the federal funds rate through 2019. The black solid lines show the\nmedian value of the federal funds rate at the end of each year. To understand the\nconsiderations that likely underlay these judgments, I will contrast participants’\nassessments with the recommendations of some simple policy rules commonly used to\nhelp gauge the appropriate stance of policy. As I noted, the Committee routinely reviews\npolicy recommendations from a variety of benchmark rules, and I believe that their\nprescriptions can be helpful in providing broad guidance about how the federal funds rate\nshould be adjusted over time in response to movements in real activity and inflation.\nThat said, I will emphasize that the use and interpretation of such prescriptions require\n10 These individual projections are published quarterly in the Summary of Economic Projections that\naccompanies the release of the minutes from the March, June, September and December meetings of the\nFOMC.\n11 The FOMC’s procedures share many of the features of forecast targeting, an approach to monetary\npolicymaking advocated by Svensson (2005), among others. However, while the Committee publishes\nparticipants’ projections--including policy paths--in the SEP, it does not publish a “consensus” forecast, in\ncontrast to some other central banks.\n\n- 9 -\ncareful judgments about both the measurement of the inputs to these rules and the\nimplications of the many considerations the rules do not take into account.\nConsider first the well-known Taylor rule, which embodies key principles of good\nmonetary policy. The rule calls for systematic adjustments in the federal funds rate\nrelative to its expected longer-run neutral level in response to movements in inflation and\nthe output gap, defined as the percentage difference between actual output and the\neconomy’s productive potential.12 To implement the rule, one must decide on the\nappropriate definition and measurement of its inputs. Should inflation be defined using\nthe latest noisy quarterly reading on headline PCE inflation or a measure intended to\nsmooth through transitory price movements? What technique should be used to\napproximate the output gap, given that different approaches often yield materially\ndifferent estimates? And what assumption should be made about the neutral value of the\nfederal funds rate in the longer run?\nThe Taylor rule is often implemented by assuming that the real, or inflation-\nadjusted, value of the longer-run neutral interest rate--which I will call R* for\n12 Formally, the rule originally published by Taylor (1993) can be written as\n, where R is the federal funds rate, R* is the level of the real fed∗eral funds rate that on\naverage is e∗xpected to be consistent with sustaining maximum employment a𝑅𝑅n 𝑡𝑡 d =sta𝑅𝑅ble+ in𝜋𝜋fl 𝑡𝑡 a+tion in the\nl0o.5ng(𝜋𝜋er 𝑡𝑡 r−un𝜋𝜋, π) i+s c0u.r5r𝑌𝑌e 𝑡𝑡 nt inflation, π* is the central bank’s inflation objective (2 percent, in the case of the\nFederal Reserve), and Y is the output gap, defined as the difference between the current level of real GDP\nand what it would be if the economy was operating at maximum employment. Importantly, the rule\nembodies three key principles that central banks take into account when setting policy to stabilize inflation\nand the overall economy. First, a persistent movement in inflation requires a more than one-for-one\nresponse of the policy rate to stabilize inflation. Second, monetary policy should raise real interest rates\nabove their normal longer-run level whenever inflation is above its desired level and resource utilization is\nhigher than normal, and lower them when the opposite holds. (Note that implementing this latter principle\nrequires estimates of both the economy’s productive potential and the longer-run level of the real policy\nrate that would be consistent with keeping the economy operating on an even keel.) And, finally,\npolicymakers should respond in a systematic manner to changes in economic conditions in order to help\nfinancial market participants and others better understand how policy is likely to respond over time to\ncurrent and future events, thereby influencing expectations in a way that promotes economic stability.\n\n- 10 -\nconvenience--is equal to 2 percent, roughly the average historical value of the real federal\nfunds rate prior to the financial crisis. For inflation, we can use the 12-month change in\ncore PCE prices, a measure of the current underlying rate of inflation. And the output\ngap can be reasonably approximated as twice the difference between the estimated\nlonger-run normal rate of unemployment and the actual unemployment rate.13 The\ndashed red line in figure 5 shows the resulting recommendations for policy over the\nmedium term, based on the medians of the unemployment and inflation projections\nsubmitted by FOMC participants in December but assuming--in contrast to the median of\nparticipants’ December assessments--that R* equals 2 percent. As figure 5 shows, this\nversion of the Taylor rule prescribes a much higher path for the federal funds rate than\nthe median of participants’ assessments of appropriate policy.\nOne important factor explaining this divergence is the FOMC’s growing\nrecognition that the longer-run neutral level of the real federal funds rate has likely\ndeclined below 2 percent, contrary to what is often assumed in implementations of the\nTaylor rule. As illustrated by the left-hand panel of figure 6, since 2000, both FOMC\nparticipants and respondents to the Blue Chip survey have markedly reduced their\nprojections of the level of real short-term interest rates expected to prevail in the longer\nrun. Presumably, these revisions were made in response to accumulating evidence that\nlower real interest rates than those seen on average in the past would be needed\npermanently to keep the economy operating on an even keel. In addition, the right-hand\npanel shows considerable changes over time in estimates of the normal longer-run rate of\n13 Historically, percent deviations of real GDP from statistical estimates of its long-run trend are roughly\ntwice as large on average as deviations of the unemployment rate from its estimated long-run value--a\nrelationship known as Okun’s law.\n\n- 11 -\nunemployment, with corresponding implications for estimates of the economy’s\nproductive potential and the output gap. Such revisions would imply shifts in the level of\nthe Taylor rule’s prescriptions by as much as 1-1/4 percentage points, holding other\nfactors constant.14 Clearly, sensible implementation of policy rules requires adjustments\nto take such changes into account, as a failure to do so would result in poor monetary\npolicy decisions and poor economic outcomes.15\nFigure 7 illustrates the policy implications of alternative revised assessments of\nthe longer-run neutral real rate of interest. As before, the short-dashed red line shows the\nprescriptions of the Taylor rule using the standard 2 percent assumption for R*. The\nsolid red line, however, shows the rule’s prescriptions with R* equal to 1 percent, the\nmedian of the longer-run projections of the real federal funds rate made by FOMC\nparticipants last month. This adjustment appreciably reduces the rule’s policy\nprescriptions.\nEven with this downward adjustment of the longer-run neutral rate, however, the\nTaylor rule’s prescriptions are arguably still too restrictive. The problem is that the rule\nignores the likelihood that it will likely take many years before the forces now restraining\n14 Additional complications arise in the measurement of economic slack because the difference between the\nunemployment rate and its estimated normal level is not always a complete gauge of overall labor\nutilization. Such was the case in the current expansion until recently because the labor force participation\nrate was unusually low and involuntary part-time employment unusually high, given the level of the\nunemployment rate. Moreover, although movements in resource utilization for the economy as a whole are\ngenerally proportional to changes in labor utilization, the relationship varies somewhat over time. Partly as\na result, contemporaneous estimates of the output gap can deviate markedly from subsequent estimates for\nthe same period calculated using revised data. For example, in early 2010, the Congressional Budget\nOffice (CBO) estimated that the output gap in 2009:Q2 was negative 7.7 percent, but the CBO has since\nlowered it to negative 6.3 percent--a large revision with important implications for assessments of the\ndeviation of actual policy from the prescriptions of simple policy rules.\n15 If monetary policy persistently followed the prescriptions of a Taylor rule that assumed that R* was\n2 percent when it was in fact 1 percent, then employment would run persistently below its maximum\nsustainable level and inflation would run persistently below 2 percent. Under such circumstances, inflation\nexpectations might begin to fall, creating a risk of deflation.\n\n- 12 -\nthe economy dissipate to the degree envisioned in participants’ estimates of the longer-\nrun normal level of the real federal funds rate. Because overall growth has been quite\nmoderate over the past few years despite an accommodative stance of monetary policy,\nsome recent estimates of the current value of the neutral real federal funds rate stand\nclose to zero.16 If the neutral rate were to remain quite low over the medium term, as\nwould be expected if the global economy does not materially strengthen and productivity\ngrowth remains anemic, then the appropriate setting for R* in the Taylor rule would\narguably be zero, yielding a yet lower path for the federal funds rate, as shown by the\nlong-dashed red line. These considerations illustrate that there is now no obvious “right”\nsetting for R* because we do not know how rapidly the forces restraining the economy\nwill abate, and there is a significant risk that it could be very slow. When the economy\nhas been hit with unusually persistent shocks, the Taylor rule, for this reason, provides a\nproblematic benchmark.\nSimple policy rules also typically neglect information with potentially important\nimplications for the economic outlook because they focus only on where conditions are\ntoday. For example, simple rules ignore such important factors as fiscal policy, trends\naffecting global growth, structural developments influencing the supply of credit, and\noverall financial conditions. One special factor at the moment pertains to the Federal\nReserve’s balance sheet. The downward pressure on longer-term interest rates that the\nFed’s asset holdings exert is expected to diminish over time--a development that amounts\n16 For example, see Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2016).\n\n- 13 -\nto a “passive” removal of monetary policy accommodation. Other things being equal,\nthis factor argues for a more gradual approach to raising short-term rates.17\nLastly, simple rules ignore important risk-management considerations that have\ninfluenced the Committee’s decisions in recent years. With the federal funds rate still\nnear zero, the Committee recognizes that, should the economy unexpectedly weaken in\nthe next year or two, there would likely be only limited scope to respond by lowering\nshort-term rates. But if the economy instead began to overheat, threatening to push\ninflation to an undesirably high level, the FOMC would have ample scope to respond\nthrough tighter monetary policy. Such asymmetric risks arguably call for a more gradual\npath of rate increases than indicated by the prescriptions of a simple policy rule.\nThe academic literature on policy rules has studied many alternatives to the\nTaylor rule, and the FOMC regularly reviews a number of them.18 These rules embed\ndiffering but valuable perspectives, and there is no consensus among central bankers or\nacademics about the relative utility of various rules. One such alternative is the\n“balanced approach” rule, illustrated by the purple short-dashed line in figure 8. This\nrule differs from the Taylor rule by being twice as responsive to movements in resource\n17 Based on estimates generated using the term-structure model developed by Li and Wei (2013) and the\nprocedure discussed in Ihrig and others (2012) and extended by Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015),\nthe Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities continue to\nput considerable downward pressure on longer-term interest rates. However, this pressure is estimated to\nbe gradually easing as the average maturity of the portfolio declines and the end-date for reinvestment\ndraws closer. Over the course of 2017, this easing could increase the yield on the 10-year Treasury note by\nabout 15 basis points, all else being equal. Based on the estimated co-movement of short-term and long-\nterm interest rates, such a change in longer-term yields would be similar to that which, on average, has\nhistorically accompanied two 25 basis point hikes in the federal funds rate.\n18 For example, prescriptions from seven different rules, calculated using forecasts of economic activity and\ninflation from different sources, are regularly posted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland at\nhttps://www.clevelandfed.org/our-research/indicators-and-data/simple-monetary-policy-rules.aspx.\n\n- 14 -\nutilization.19 The prescriptions of the balanced-approach rule in this figure, as with the\nsolid red Taylor-rule plot, assume that R* equals 1 percent, consistent with the medians\nof the latest FOMC projections. Because participants on average anticipate a modest\nundershooting of the unemployment rate below its estimated longer-run level, the\nbalanced-approach rule calls for a slightly faster pace of tightening over the next several\nyears than the Taylor rule.\nFigure 8 also reports results for a “change” rule, shown as the green long-dashed\nline. As its name implies, this rule does not prescribe a particular level of the federal\nfunds rate at a given time but rather how the existing rate should change from quarter to\nquarter based on two gaps--the difference between inflation and its desired level as well\nas the difference between the unemployment rate and its longer-run normal level.20 In\ncontrast to the other two rules, the change rule does not take a stand on the value of the\nlonger-run neutral level of the real federal funds rate, thus avoiding a potential source of\nerror. Instead, it moves interest rates up and down until both gaps close, an approach that\nin theory enables it to perform well when the true value of R* is unknown. Because both\ngaps are relatively modest at the moment and are projected to remain so, the change rule\ncalls for fairly gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy over the next few\nyears given the current outlook.\n19 The balanced-approach rule is , where all terms are defined as in\nthe Taylor rule.

For a discussion of this rule (and of policy rules in general), see Taylor and Williams\n(2010).\n\n- 15 -\nThe FOMC, for reasons that I have discussed, does not base its decisions on the\nprescriptions of any specific policy rule. Nevertheless, the three benchmarks I have\ndescribed--the Taylor rule, the balanced-approach rule, and the change rule, appropriately\ncalibrated--have historically provided useful guidance about appropriate adjustments in\nthe general direction of monetary policy over time. This guidance is illustrated by\nfigure 9, which compares the path of the federal funds rate since 2000 with the\nprescriptions of the three rules, based on the actual rates of inflation and unemployment\nobserved at each point in time, along with contemporaneous Blue Chip projections of the\nlonger-run unemployment rate and R*.\nAs the figure shows, the rules clearly signaled that a major reduction in the\nfederal funds rate was appropriate in 2008 given the marked deterioration in economic\nconditions. In addition, all three rules signaled that monetary policy needed to provide\nmore stimulus during the recession and the subsequent recovery than could be provided\nby keeping short-term interest rates near zero. For this reason, the Committee turned to\nasset purchases to help make up for the shortfall by putting additional downward pressure\non longer-term interest rates. The FOMC also sought to compensate for its inability to\npush the federal funds rate below zero by indicating that the funds rate would need to stay\nunusually low for longer than would otherwise be expected and simple policy rules\nwould prescribe.21 Under this “make up” strategy, and taking into account the reasons\nfor deviating from the Taylor rule that I discussed a moment ago, the Committee kept the\n21 For example, the FOMC advised in the statement released after its December 2012 meeting that\nconditions would likely warrant keeping the funds rate near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate\nwas above 6-1/2 percent--a threshold that was not passed until mid-2014. As discussed by Reifschneider\nand Williams (2000), Werning (2012), and Woodford (2012), this type of lower-for-longer guidance can\nhelp compensate for the constraint on monetary policy created by the zero lower bound on nominal interest\nrates. Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015) find that the FOMC’s guidance, together with its asset\npurchases, provided significant economic stimulus in the years following the financial crisis.\n\n- 16 -\nfederal funds rate near zero for longer than two of the rules would have prescribed. But\nas labor market conditions continued to improve over time, the rising trajectories for the\nfederal funds rate prescribed by all three rules signaled that the time was drawing near to\nbegin gradually reducing monetary accommodation. Consistent with this advice, the\nFOMC suspended its asset purchase program in mid-2014 and began raising the federal\nfunds rate in late 2015.22\nTo sum up, simple policy rules can serve as useful benchmarks to help assess how\nmonetary policy should be adjusted over time. However, their prescriptions must be\ninterpreted carefully, both because estimates of some of their key inputs can vary\nsignificantly and because the rules often do not take into account important\nconsiderations and information pertaining to the outlook. For these reasons, the rules\nshould not be followed mechanically, since doing so could have adverse consequences\nfor the economy.\nConclusion\nMy remarks have focused on the policy trajectory that the Committee now\nconsiders likely to be appropriate to sustain the economic expansion while keeping\ninflation close to our 2 percent goal. In concluding, it is important to emphasize the\nconsiderable uncertainty that attaches to such assessments and the need to constantly\nupdate them.\nIn particular, the path of the neutral federal funds rate, which plays an important\nrole in determining the appropriate policy path, is highly uncertain. For example,\nproductivity growth is a key determinant of the neutral rate, and while most forecasters\n22 For a closer look at the FOMC’s policy actions in 2016 and their relationship to previous forecasts and\nsubsequent changes in economic conditions, see Nechio and Rudebusch (2016).\n\n- 17 -\nexpect productivity growth to pick up from its recent unusually slow pace, the timing of\nsuch a pickup is highly uncertain. Indeed, there is little consensus among researchers\nabout the causes of the recent slowdown in productivity growth that has occurred both at\nhome and abroad.23 The strength of global growth will also have an important bearing on\nthe neutral rate through both trade and financial channels, and here, too, the scope for\nsurprises is considerable. Finally, I would mention the potential for changes in fiscal\npolicy to affect the economic outlook and the appropriate policy path. At this point,\nhowever, the size, timing, and composition of such changes remain uncertain.24\nHowever, as this discussion highlights, the course of monetary policy over the next few\nyears will depend on many different factors, of which fiscal policy is just one.\n23 To sample some of the different views about the sources of the recent slowdown in productivity growth\nand the prospects for faster growth in the future, see Gordon (2016), Fernald and Wang (2015),\nBrynjolfsson and McAfee (2014), and Decker and others (2016, forthcoming).\n24 A related source of uncertainty is the limited ability of economists to predict the effects of specific\nchanges in tax policy or government spending on the overall economy. In part, this uncertainty arises\nbecause the net effect depends to some extent on the response of financial markets; in addition, estimates\nvary considerably on the economic effects of changes in marginal tax rates or different types of spending.\n\n- 18 -\nReferences\nAaronson, Stephanie, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis-Reig, Christopher\nSmith, and William Wascher (2014). “Labor Force Participation: Recent\nDevelopments and Future Prospects,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity,\nFall, pp. 197-255, www.brookings.edu/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2016/07/Fall2014BPEA_Aaronson_et_al.pdf.\nBrynjolfsson, Erik, and Andrew McAfee (2014).

    "text": "Presentation to the Burnham-Moores Center for Real Estate\nSchool of Business Administration, University of San Diego\nSan Diego, CA\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor Delivery on February 22, 2010, 8 AM Pacific time, 11:00 AM Eastern\nThe Outlook for the Economy and Monetary Policy1\nThank you, William. It’s very nice to see a familiar face and to receive such a gracious\nintroduction. And it’s a pleasure to be here with you in beautiful San Diego. This morning, I\nwill try to cover a lot of ground. I’ll survey the economic landscape, and give you my reading of\nthe outlook for the national economy. I’ll also discuss the situation in San Diego and finish with\nsome comments about monetary policy. In particular, I want to go over a matter that’s on the\nminds of many people right now: the Federal Reserve’s strategy for winding down the\nextraordinary measures taken during the financial and economic crisis of the past few years. My\ncomments reflect my own views, and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve colleagues.\nGiven the dismal economic news we faced for so long, it’s a great relief for me to report\nthat the tide appears to have turned. We are seeing convincing evidence that an economic\nrecovery is well under way. Still, as I’ll explain in greater detail in a few minutes, the fact that\nthe economy is growing again doesn’t mean we’re where we ought to be. Far from it. In\nparticular, the unemployment rate is unacceptably high, creating real hardship for millions of\nAmericans. But, at least we’re heading in the right direction.\nLet me start with the good news. Real gross domestic product, or GDP, the broadest\nmeasure of a country’s total output, has turned around impressively. It rose at a robust 5.7\npercent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2009. That’s a very welcome change from the huge\n1 I would like to thank Rob Valletta, John Williams, and Sam Zuckerman for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n1\n\ndeclines we saw during the recession. In fact, it’s the best gain in GDP we’ve seen in six years.\nIf we were able to sustain growth like this, we would experience a vibrant V-shaped upswing\nlike those that occurred following past severe recessions.\nUnfortunately, I’m not at all convinced that a V-shaped recovery is in the cards. That\nfourth-quarter leap in GDP overstates the underlying momentum of the economy. Much of it\nwas due to a slowdown in the pace at which businesses were drawing down inventory stocks\ncompared with earlier in the year. Less than half of the fourth-quarter growth reflected higher\nsales to customers. Those sales did grow, but at a lackluster 2.2 percent. It appears that\nbusinesses are getting their inventories closer in line with sales, which is a good thing. But such\ninventory adjustments can be a potent source of growth only for a few quarters. I’d feel much\nmore confident about the prospect for a sustained robust recovery if I saw evidence of more\nvigorous growth in actual sales.\nOn that front, the most recent data show consumers releasing somewhat their tight grips\non their wallets. But that doesn’t mean that people have thrown caution to the wind and returned\nto their spendthrift ways. Indeed, my business contacts tell me the consumer mindset is still in a\nfragile state. Clearly, the big weight hanging over everyone’s heads is jobs. The current high\nlevel of unemployment is severely restraining income and undermining confidence as people\nworry whether they will have a paycheck in the months ahead. Even those with secure jobs may\nworry about their finances since debt burdens were near historic highs at the onset of the\nfinancial crisis and, since then, equity and house prices have declined sharply. At this point,\nhouseholds are actually paying down debt, a development that partly reflects the reluctance of\nbanks to lend to households with battered balance sheets.\n2\n\nThe housing sector appears to have stabilized, but here too I don’t see any signs of a\nsharp turnaround. New home sales and construction finally stopped falling last year and have\nbeen reasonably stable, albeit at very low levels, for several months. Existing home sales surged\nlate last year in response to the homebuyer tax credit. But, the credit expires this spring, so this\nsource of support won’t be around much longer. The housing sector has also been benefiting\nfrom the Fed’s policy of buying mortgage-backed securities. These purchases appear to have\nhelped keep home finance rates low. But, the Fed is now in the process of tapering off these\npurchases and plans to stop them at the end of March. As support from Federal Reserve and\nother government programs phases out, there is a risk that the housing market could weaken\nagain.\nIf the consumer and housing sectors aren’t up to the task of delivering a V-shaped\nrecovery, can business investment spending do it? It’s true that, in past recoveries, business\ninvestment typically grew rapidly once the economy turned the corner. And, in the current\nrecession, businesses sharply curtailed capital expenditures, so they will eventually need to\nrebuild capacity and replace old equipment. In fact, we have already seen a rebound in business\nspending on equipment and software, and recent indicators for this type of spending point to\nsolid growth.\nArguing against too much optimism, however, is that businesses remain very nervous and\nexceedingly cost conscious. One of my contacts referred to a “scarring effect” in the wake of the\nrecession that has left businesses focused on survival and leery of investing. Many\nbusinesspeople say they are concentrating instead on process improvements, keeping supply\nchains lean, waiting for purchase orders before they produce, and meeting increases in demand\n3\n\nwith higher productivity from their existing workforces. True, they are beginning to plan with\ngreater confidence. But the watchword remains caution.\nEven for those businesses ready to expand—especially smaller ones—financing remains\nan impediment. Credit is becoming more available, but terms such as collateral requirements can\nbe onerous. What’s more, the crisis made businesses keenly aware that they can’t count on being\nable to get credit. Some of my contacts say they plan to keep more cash on hand, rather than\ninvesting it, as protection against a renewed credit crunch.\nMeanwhile, commercial real estate remains a bleak spot and investment in nonresidential\nstructures is likely to stay depressed for some time. The recession drove up vacancy rates for\noffice, retail, warehouse, and other income-producing properties, severely reducing demand for\nnew buildings. In addition, credit is tight. Lenders and investors are demanding extra\ncompensation for risk, driving up commercial real estate financing rates compared with pre-\nrecession levels. And the market for commercial mortgage-backed securities remains distressed,\ndespite support from the Fed’s Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF. So, I just\ndon’t see this sector contributing to growth for quite some time.2\nPut it all together and you have a recipe for a moderate rate of economic growth, well\nbelow the spritely pace set in the fourth quarter. The current quarter appears on course to post\ngrowth of around 3 percent. I see the economy gradually picking up steam over the remainder of\nthis year as households and businesses regain confidence, financial conditions improve, and\nbanks increase the supply of credit. I expect growth of about 3½ percent for the year as a whole,\n2 See Yellen 2009 for an in-depth discussion of commercial real estate.\n4\n\npicking up to about 4½ percent next year, with private demand coming on line to pick up the\nslack as government stimulus programs fade away.\nIn addition to some of the weak spots I already mentioned, a number of other factors are\nholding back recovery. First, even though the banking and financial systems are gaining\nstrength, they still bear wounds from the financial crisis, and these will take a long time to fully\nheal. Second, losses on mortgages, commercial real estate credits, and other loans continue to\nmount, and the full weight of foreclosures and bank failures on the economy has yet to be felt.\nFinally, the Fed, as well as central banks in other countries, has faced limits in the amount of\nmonetary stimulus we have been able to generate. That’s because we can’t push interest rates\nbelow the near-zero level where they’ve been for more than a year. To be sure, we’ve developed\nmany innovative programs to make credit cheaper and more readily available. But, all in all,\nmonetary policy can’t give the same kick to the economy that it delivered in past recoveries.\nEarlier I noted that, even though the recession appears to be over, it does not mean that\nwe are where we want to be. Even with my moderate growth forecast, the economy will be\noperating well below its potential for several years. Economists think in terms of what we call\nthe “output gap,” which measures the difference between the actual level of GDP and the level\nwhere GDP would be if the economy were operating at full employment. The output gap was\naround negative 6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009, based on Congressional Budget Office\nestimates. That’s a very big number and it means the U.S. economy was producing 6 percent\nless than it could have had we been at full employment. That’s equivalent to more than $900\nbillion of lost output per year, or roughly $3,000 per person.\n5\n\nI’m afraid that the economy will continue to operate well below its potential throughout\nthis year and next. Let me do a little math for you. The San Francisco Fed estimates that the\npotential level of output is increasing roughly 2½ percent a year due to growth in the labor force\nand increases in productivity. Hence, over the next two years, potential output will increase by\nabout 5 percent. My forecast is that real GDP will increase about 8 percent during that period, or\n3 percentage points more than potential output. This implies that the output gap will shrink from\nits current level of negative 6 percent to around negative 3 percent by the end of 2011. In fact, I\ndon’t expect the output gap to completely vanish until sometime in 2013.\nThis brings us to a subject that is of paramount concern to all of us—the job situation.\nThis recession has been very severe, indeed. The U.S. economy has shed 8.4 million jobs since\nDecember 2007. That’s more than a 6 percent drop in payrolls, the largest percentage point\ndecline since the demobilization following World War II. The unemployment rate, which was 5\npercent at the start of the recession, rose to around 10 percent in late 2009. The rates of job\nopenings and hiring are also stuck at very low levels. These statistics represent a tragedy for our\ncountry, our communities, and each of the families and individuals who have had to cope with a\nloss of livelihood.\nThere is a glimmer of good news on the employment front. The pace of job losses has\nslowed dramatically and some indicators, such as gains in temporary jobs, suggest that we may\nbe close to a turnaround in the labor market. I was encouraged to see the unemployment rate\ndrop from 10 percent to 9.7 percent in January. Nonetheless, given my forecast of moderate\ngrowth and a shrinking, but still sizable, output gap, I expect unemployment to remain painfully\nhigh for years. The rate should edge down from its current level to about 9¼ percent by the end\nof this year and still be about 8 percent by the end of 2011, a far cry from full employment.\n6\n\nI should warn that there is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding this forecast. In the\npast, a given level of economic growth produced a more-or-less predictable change in the\nunemployment rate. Historically, a pattern emerged in which unemployment declined by half as\nmuch as the difference in the growth rates of actual and potential GDP. This is commonly\nreferred to as “Okun’s law” after the economist Arthur Okun, who first described this\nrelationship back in the 1960s.\nLet me sketch out how this should work. In my forecast, GDP growth exceeds the\ngrowth rate of potential GDP by 1 percentage point this year and 2 percentage points next year.\nAccording to Okun’s law, the unemployment rate should fall by about one-half percentage point\nby the end of this year and a full percentage point during 2011. These figures are in line with my\nunemployment forecast.\nHowever, Okun’s law let us down big-time in 2009. Given that GDP was stagnant last\nyear, the unemployment rate should have gone up by about 1¼ percentage points, according to\nOkun’s law. In fact, it shot up 3 percentage points. Understanding what happened last year has\nimportant implications for what unemployment does in the future.\nEconomists have come up with a number of possible explanations for why the\nunemployment rate rose so much last year. The first explanation for the failure of Okun’s law is\nthat special factors not directly related to output growth may be pushing up the unemployment\nrate. One possibility is that the severe recession is fundamentally altering the labor market,\nshifting jobs away from such sectors as manufacturing, real estate, and finance to other sectors.\nThis reallocation takes time. Until it is complete, we will see higher levels of unemployment. A\nsecond possibility is that extended unemployment benefits are artificially boosting reported\n7\n\nunemployment rates because workers who collect unemployment checks may be saying they are\nlooking for work even if they have given up. In the past, such people might not have said they\nwere searching for jobs and would no longer have been considered part of the labor force and\ncounted in the official unemployment statistics.\nStill, there is little evidence that structural shifts in the labor market or extended\nunemployment benefits have had large effects on the unemployment rate. Take the\nunemployment benefits explanation. If true, we would expect to see a large increase in the labor\nforce participation rate, that is, the percentage of people who are working or saying they are\nlooking for work. In fact, currently, the labor force participation rate does not appear to be\nunusually high.\nA second possible explanation is that last year’s enormous decline in employment was\nsomehow an aberration. GDP was basically unchanged over the four quarters of 2009. But\npayroll employment fell by 4 percent over the same period. In other words, the economy\nproduced roughly the same quantity of goods and services with 4 percent fewer workers, which\ntranslates into a 4 percent increase in output per worker. That’s a huge rate of productivity\ngrowth, well above estimates of the long-term trend in productivity gains that stem from such\nfactors as improved technology. So, if we ask where Okun’s law went astray, we can see the\nfingerprints of this unusual pattern of employment and productivity last year. But that’s not the\nend of the mystery. What would cause employment to dive and productivity to soar during such\na severe recession? And is it a temporary or permanent phenomenon?\nThose who believe it’s temporary point to the unusual nature of this terrible financial\ncrisis and recession. Its severity made employers believe that it would be a long time, if ever,\n8\n\nbefore they would need as many workers as they previously had. The credit crunch may also\nhave caused some to fear that they wouldn’t be able to borrow in order to meet their payrolls.\nThese factors prompted employers to break from the normal cyclical pattern in which workers\nare laid off relatively slowly and some are kept in reserve in case demand picks up. In this\nscenario, workforces have been cut to the bone and perhaps beyond. Businesses were able to\ncontinue to produce the same level of output despite big cuts in their workforces by working\ntheir employees harder. But that can only go so far. If demand continues to increase and\nbusinesses become more confident, they will eventually begin hiring again. If so, productivity\ngrowth will slow and the unemployment rate will fall faster than usual, reversing its unusual rise\nlast year.\nThere is an alternative explanation regarding the events of last year though that bodes\npoorly for rapid employment gains going forward. According to this view, last year’s large\nincrease in productivity is here to stay. In that case, we won’t see a quick drop in unemployment\nand may be in for a jobless recovery akin to those in the early 1990s and early 2000s. This is\ncloser to my view and broadly consistent with my forecast.\nAccording to this perspective, the recession has forced businesses to reexamine just about\neverything they do with an eye toward restraining costs and boosting efficiency. Strapped by\ntight credit and plummeting sales, businesses have overhauled the way they manage supply\nchains, inventory, production practices, and staffing. Stores don’t order merchandise unless they\nthink they can sell it right away. Manufacturers and builders don’t produce unless they have\nbuyers lined up. My business contacts describe this as a paradigm shift and they believe it’s\npermanent. This process of implementing new efficiency gains may have only begun and we\n9\n\nmay be in store for further efficiency improvements and high productivity growth for some time.\nIf so, the rate of job creation will be frustratingly slow.\nI’d like to bring this discussion home now by talking a little about San Diego. Obviously,\nthe area economy was hit hard during the recession, but it does seem to have weathered the storm\nbetter than many areas of California. And, significantly, the San Diego area has shown signs of a\njob market turnaround in recent months. Employment grew notably in October and the gains\nwere largely maintained in November and December. To be sure, San Diego still has far to go.\nThe unemployment rate was significantly above the national average in December, the most\nrecent data we have.\nSan Diego is among the nation’s leading biotechnology centers and this industry has been\na bright spot. Biotech accounts for about two-and-a-half times as great a share of employment\nand income here as it does nationwide. Biotech wasn’t entirely immune—if I may use that\nword—to the recession. But demand for medical services continued to expand and that\nsupported the industry. It appears that local biotech employment has largely held up during the\npast two years. Makers of pharmaceuticals, medical equipment manufacturers, and providers of\nresearch and development services even registered significant employment gains. Moreover,\ngrowth should continue. After bottoming out in early 2009, venture capital spending has risen\nsubstantially, with an important share going to biotech.\nThe local housing market appears to be improving as well. Fortunately, San Diego never\nsaw as big a subprime mortgage boom as Nevada, Arizona, and some other places in California.\nNevertheless, home foreclosures have surged in the San Diego area, rising from under 1 percent\nin the fall of 2007 to slightly over 3 percent of existing mortgages in December of last year. The\n10\n\ntrend, though, may be heading in the right direction. Foreclosures declined slightly in San Diego\nin December, even as they continued to rise nationwide.\nOverall, the San Diego economy will likely recover along with the national economy. At\nthe same time, I would not be too surprised to see the recovery take hold here with a bit more\nvigor than in the nation as a whole for the reasons I mentioned a moment ago.\nLet me move on to the outlook for inflation nationwide. You can get into quite a debate\non this topic. Some people worry that sustained federal budget deficits and the huge increase in\nthe Federal Reserve’s lending and stimulus programs could eventually lead to high inflation.\nOthers take the opposite view, arguing that economic slack and downward pressure on wages\nand prices are pushing inflation down. I would put myself squarely in the second camp.\nI’m no fan of persistently large budget deficits. I’ve warned against them throughout my\ncareer. But the real danger I see from them is not inflation. Rather, they may be harmful once\nthe economy recovers because they are apt to boost interest rates and absorb private savings that\nwould otherwise finance productive investments. This is potentially a serious problem in the\nlong term that could reduce investment and lower living standards, although, in the short run,\nfederal deficits have cushioned the blow from the financial crisis and recession. As far as\ninflation is concerned, there’s no evidence that big government deficits cause high inflation in\nadvanced economies with independent central banks, such as the Fed. Japan is a case in point.\nJapan has run enormous fiscal deficits for many years and its government debt has risen to very\nhigh levels. Yet is has suffered from persistent deflation, not inflation.\n11\n\nI believe that the more worrisome challenge for price stability over the next few years\nstems primarily from the sizable amount of slack in the economy. Whether measured by the\noutput gap, the unemployment rate, the manufacturing capacity utilization rate, or whichever\nmeasure you like, the economy is running well below its potential. As a result, inflation is\nalready very low and trending downward. Over the past 12 months, the personal consumption\nprice index, excluding volatile food and energy prices, rose a modest 1.5 percent. This increase\nin core inflation was below the 2 percent rate that I and most of my fellow Fed policymakers on\nthe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) consider an appropriate long-term price stability\nobjective. And, with slack likely to persist for years and wages barely rising, it seems quite\npossible that core inflation will move even lower this year and next.\nSo where does all this leave Federal Reserve policy? Traditionally, the main tool of Fed\nmonetary policy is the federal funds rate, which is what banks charge each other for overnight\nloans. The Fed controls that rate by varying the amount of reserves it supplies to the banking\nsystem and we have pushed that rate to zero for all practical purposes. This is as low as it can\ngo. Such accommodative policy is appropriate, in my view, because the economy is operating\nwell below its potential and inflation is undesirably low. I believe this is not the time to be\nremoving monetary stimulus. Consistent with that view, the FOMC has repeatedly stated that it\nexpects low interest rates to continue for an extended period.\nOf course, in response to financial and economic emergency, the Fed has done a lot more\nthan simply lower the federal funds rate. It has provided secured loans to banks and other\nfinancial institutions to make sure key credit markets were functioning. It is also in the last\nstages of purchasing $1.25 trillion dollars of mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by agencies\nsuch as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and $175 billion of the direct debt of these agencies.\n12\n\nThese programs were vital in preventing a complete financial breakdown, which would have\ndone immeasurable damage to our society.\nAs financial and economic conditions improve, the need for such extraordinary support\ndiminishes. Accordingly, the Fed has begun to phase out its emergency lending programs.\nSpecial lending programs for primary dealers in the Treasury securities market, for money\nmarket mutual funds, and for corporate short-term debt have already been ended. So too have\nwe shut down special arrangements to make dollars available to foreign central banks. The Term\nAuction Facility (TAF) and the TALF, which respectively supported financial institutions and\ncredit markets, will be largely closed next month.3 Finally, the Federal Reserve has readjusted\nthe terms of its loans to banks and thrifts—so-called discount window lending. During the\nfinancial crisis, we encouraged depository institutions to borrow from us when they needed cash\nto meet essential obligations. Now that financial markets are functioning more normally, banks\ncan meet their usual funding needs by tapping private markets.\nAs we carried out our emergency lending programs and eased monetary policy in\nresponse to the recession, our balance sheet swelled from roughly $800 billion to its current level\nof over $2.2 trillion. Despite the reduction in our lending programs, our balance sheet remains,\nfor want of a better word, enormous, owing to our holdings of mortgage-backed securities and\nagency debt. Now I just said this is not the time to be tightening monetary policy. But\neventually the economy will gain enough momentum and won’t need today’s extraordinarily low\ninterest rates. When that time comes, we will begin to tighten policy and remove monetary\nstimulus. And when we start doing so, we will face some technical issues due to the size of the\n3 The TALF for loans backed by new-issue commercial mortgage-backed securities will remain open until June 30.\n13\n\nbalance sheet, as Chairman Bernanke noted in recent Congressional testimony.4 Let me briefly\noutline our strategy.\nIn normal times, the Fed raises interest rates by reducing the size of its balance sheet, say\nby selling Treasury securities to the public. This draws in cash from the economy, or, as we say,\nreduces the supply of bank reserves, which in turn causes the price of those reserves, that is, the\nfederal funds rate, to go up. Since the fed funds rate is the benchmark for banks’ cost of money,\nother short-term market interest rates tend to follow suit. Higher interest rates in turn help slow\nthe economy and reduce inflationary pressures.\nBut these aren’t normal times. Our securities purchases have caused the quantity of\nreserves in the banking system to swell to something like $1 trillion—far above the pre-crisis\nlevel of around $50 billion. If we were to follow our standard approach of selling securities to\nraise interest rates, we would have to sell off many hundreds of billions of dollars of securities to\nreduce the supply of reserves enough to have any chance of pushing rates higher.\nThe problem with doing that is that such massive sales of mortgage-related and Treasury\nsecurities could be disruptive to markets and cause mortgage interest rates and other long-term\nrates to shoot up when we are still in the early stages of the recovery and the financial system,\nalthough improving, is still not at full health.\nThere is an alternative. To push up short-term interest rates without selling off our\nsecurities holdings, we can instead raise the interest rate that we pay on reserves held at the Fed.\nBecause banks would have the opportunity to collect a higher reward for keeping funds on\ndeposit at the Fed, they would demand commensurately higher returns on the overnight loans\n4 See Bernanke 2010.\n14\n\nthat they make in the federal funds market. So an increase in the interest rate paid on reserves\nwould raise the fed funds rate and tighten financial conditions more generally. The ability to pay\ninterest on the excess reserves that banks deposit with the Fed is an important new tool that\nCongress gave us just over a year ago. It will play a lead role when the time ultimately comes to\ntighten monetary policy. And, to make sure this works smoothly, we have developed some\ntechnical tools that can help keep the federal funds rate near our preferred target.5 Eventually,\nafter economic conditions have improved and a policy tightening has begun, we may then start a\ngradual process of selling securities in order to help return the Fed’s balance sheet to its pre-\ncrisis levels.\nThe bottom line is that we are already unwinding the emergency programs we set up\nduring the financial crisis. When the day comes to start raising rates again, we have tools at the\nready. But, for the time being, the economy still needs the support of extraordinarily low rates.\nThank you very much.\n5 See Bernanke 2010 for a discussion of reverse repurchase operations and the term deposit facility.\n15\n\nReferences\nBernanke, Ben S. 2010. “Federal Reserve’s Exit Strategy.” Testimony before the Committee on\nFinancial Services U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC, February 10.\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/bernanke20100210a.htm\nYellen, Janet L. 2009. “The Outlook for the Economy and Real Estate.” Presentation to the\nPhoenix Chapter of Lambda Alpha International, Phoenix, AZ, November 10.\nhttp://www.frbsf.org/news/speeches/2009/janet_yellen1110.html\n16",

    "text": "Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\n101 Market Street, San Francisco, California 94105\nApril 26, 2013\nTo State Member Banks, Bank\nHolding Companies, Financial Holding\nCompanies, Savings and Loan Holding Companies,\nand Foreign Banking Offices\nin the Twelfth Federal Reserve District\nSR 13-9 / CA 13-6 Minimum Standards for Prioritization and Handling Borrower Files with\nImminent Scheduled Foreclosure Sale\nApplicability to Community Banking Organizations: This guidance applies to any financial institution\nsupervised by the Federal Reserve, regardless of asset size, that engages in mortgage servicing\nactivities.\nPurpose\nThe Federal Reserve is issuing this letter to set forth guidance on sound business practices for residential\nmortgage servicing that Federal Reserve supervised financial institutions1 are expected to address in their\ncollections, loss mitigation, and foreclosure processing functions. The guidance confirms the minimum\nstandards that all regulated institutions are expected to adopt in prioritizing and handling borrowers’ files\nwith imminent risk of foreclosure.\nBackground\nThe residential mortgage crisis revealed weaknesses in the servicing of residential mortgage loans2 .\nThese weaknesses were pervasive throughout the mortgage servicing industry and were centered in the\nadministration of delinquent loans, loss mitigation practices, and foreclosure processing. As a result, in\nFebruary 2012, the Federal Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued\nguidance to banking organizations subject to enforcement actions for deficient practices in mortgage loan\nservicing and foreclosure processing (“Consent Orders”) establishing certain minimum standards for the\nhandling and prioritization of files with an imminent foreclosure sale (“February 2012 Guidance”). The\nFebruary 2012 Guidance was intended to ensure that borrowers would not lose their homes without first\nreceiving either a review of their foreclosure in accordance with the standards, at a minimum, or a full\nindependent review under the Consent Orders. At those servicers subject to the February 2012\nGuidance, examiners are continuing to monitor these institutions for compliance with this guidance.\nAs of March 2013, the servicers already subject to the February 2012 Guidance account for more than 57\npercent of the residential mortgage industry’s total servicing volume. Consequently, the Federal Reserve\nand OCC have concluded that it is appropriate to broaden applicability of the guidance to encompass the\nremaining institutions subject to their respective jurisdictions that service residential mortgages, which\ncollectively account for a significant portion of the residential mortgage industry’s remaining servicing\nvolume. The standards set forth in the attached guidance reflect the February 2012 Guidance, with\nupdates and modifications to account for its broadened applicability, and are consistent with previously\nissued statements by the Federal Reserve concerning financial institutions’ loss mitigation efforts3.\n1 Federal Reserve supervised financial institutions refers to state member banks, bank and savings and\nloan holding companies (including their non-bank subsidiaries), and U.S. branches and agencies of\nforeign banking organizations.\n2 See the April 2011 report on “Interagency Review of Foreclosure Policies and Practices”\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/rptcongress/interagency_review_foreclosures_20110413.pdf\n3 Refer to SR letter 07-16/CA letter 07-4, “Statement on Loss Mitigation Strategies for Servicers of\nResidential Mortgages.”\n\nSupervisory Expectations\nThe Federal Reserve expects financial institutions that service residential mortgages to act responsibly in\ntheir administration of delinquent mortgages and borrowers at imminent risk of foreclosure. Financial\ninstitutions must comply with safe and sound banking practices, federal, state, and local laws, third party\ninvestor requirements, and the Making Home Affordable Modification Program requirements, as well as\nother existing contractual and programmatic commitments, as applicable. Prudent business practices in\nservicing residential mortgage loans include ensuring that, prior to proceeding to a foreclosure sale:\n• The loan is in default under applicable law and investor requirements;\n• Any borrower complaints, appeals, or escalations have been considered and addressed;\n• The borrower is not subject to specific legal protections such as those afforded under the Service\nmembers Civil Relief Act4 and bankruptcy law;\n• The financial institution has the appropriate legal authority to foreclose;\n• All appropriate notices have been provided to the borrower;\n• Appropriate outreach and other loss mitigation efforts have been made;\n• The loan is not currently in an active loss mitigation program;\n• The borrower is not currently qualified or being considered for a loss mitigation action; and\n• The financial institution is in compliance with all applicable federal, state, local, and other legal\nrequirements.\nThe attached guidance confirms the minimum standards for the handling and prioritization of borrowers’\nfiles that are subject to an imminent (within 60 days) scheduled foreclosure sale. These minimum review\ncriteria are intended to ensure a level of consistency across servicers, and should be used to determine\nwhether a scheduled foreclosure sale should be postponed, suspended, or cancelled because of critical\nforeclosure defects in the borrower’s file. The purpose of the guidance is to ensure that borrowers will not\nlose their homes without their files first receiving a pre-foreclosure sale review that, at a minimum, meets\nthe standards listed in the attached guidance. The Federal Reserve expects that each institution subject\nto this guidance will promptly confirm that its existing processes comply with this guidance. If an\ninstitution has not already implemented these standards, it must implement them immediately.\nThese standards are not intended to incorporate the final rules amending Regulation X and Regulation Z\nissued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) on January17, 2013, and effective on\nJanuary 10, 2014, which govern mortgage servicers’ loss mitigation and foreclosure processing\nfunctions5. The Federal Reserve expects that all servicers will undertake appropriate action in a timely\nmanner to ensure their practices will be compliant with the new rules by the effective date.\n4 For more information regarding the Service members Civil Relief Act, see CA letter 11-6, “Revised\nExamination Procedures for the Service members Civil Relief Act.”\n5 See 78 Federal Register 10696 (February 14, 2013) and 78 Federal Register 10902 (February 14,\n2013).\n\nAdditional Information\nAll circulars and documents are available on the Internet through the Federal Reserve Bank of San\nFrancisco’s website, at http://www.frbsf.org/banking/letters.\nFor additional information, please contact:\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nBanking Supervision and Regulation\n(213) 364-1026\nAttachment:\nMinimum Standards for Prioritization and Handling Borrower Files with Imminent Foreclosure\nCross Reference:\nCA Letter 11-6, “Revised Examination Procedures for the Service members Civil Relief Act”\nSR Letter 07-16/CA Letter 07-4, “Statement on Loss Mitigation Strategies for Servicers of Residential\nMortgages”",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n7:00 p.m. EST\nJanuary 12, 2017\nWelcoming Remarks\nby\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat a\nConversation with the Chair: A Teacher Town Hall Meeting\nWashington, D.C.\n(And via video link to Federal Reserve Banks)\nJanuary 12, 2017\n\nThank you, and thank you to all the educators who have come to the Board this\nevening or travelled to one of the Fed’s regional Reserve Banks to watch and listen via\nthe webcast.\nI am very much looking forward to hearing from you about teaching economics,\nand I am eager to respond to your questions. For that reason, and also because I expect\nthat school starts very early tomorrow for many of you, I will try to keep my remarks\nbrief. But I do have a message to impart about the work you do, which is vitally\nimportant not only to your students, but also, I believe, to the world they will soon inherit\nand even to the mission of the Federal Reserve.\nFirst and foremost, of course, like all teachers, you are helping prepare your\nstudents for successful and rewarding lives. The knowledge you impart and the intellect\nand talents you help develop are powerful tools your students can use to build those lives.\nLike some other subjects students encounter in school, economics teaches analytical and\ncritical thinking skills that can aid in the development and success of anyone. Part of\nsuccess for your students is economic success--as capable, creative, and productive\nmembers of the workforce and as consumers adept at managing their finances.\nEconomics provides knowledge and skills of practical use in college and in the\nworkplace, and it also provides skills to plan and make wise financial decisions, which\nare some of the most important and consequential that we face in life.\nYour students benefit very directly from this education, but so does everyone else\nin society. Everyone is engaged in and depends on the economy, and nothing is more\ncritical to a healthy and growing economy than the capability, creativity, and\nproductiveness of its workforce. Whenever I am asked what policies and initiatives could\n\n- 2 -\ndo the most to spur economic growth and raise living standards, improving education is\nat the top of my list.\nIn addition to the role you play in preparing students for jobs and careers, you also\nhelp prepare them to be responsible consumers. The economy needs productive workers,\nand it also depends on consumers, whose individual spending decisions, as most of you\nsurely have taught in class, collectively account for two-thirds of economic activity.\nConsumers skilled in managing their finances are better prepared to weather bad times,\nand stronger household finances overall can help sustain growth, stabilize the economy,\nand mitigate an economic downturn.\nStabilizing the economy and mitigating a downturn, of course, also happen to be\namong the Federal Reserve’s primary responsibilities. When successful, monetary policy\ncan be a powerful and effective tool to these ends, but its capabilities are dwarfed by\nlarger factors such as the productivity of the workforce and the strength of household\nfinances. By educating students and directly supporting their contributions to the\neconomy as producers and consumers, all teachers, especially teachers of economics, are\neffectively furthering our mission at the Fed, so let me offer my thanks for making that\njob a little easier.\nTo help support your important work as teachers, the Federal Reserve Board and\nthe 12 Reserve Banks conduct programs, organize events, and publish books and other\nmaterials to spread knowledge of the role of the Fed--and economics in general--and to\npromote financial literacy. Before I get to those events and programs, let me say a word\nabout what is probably the most important pedagogical aid that the Fed produces--the\n182-page book called The Federal Reserve System: Purposes and Functions. The 10th\n\n- 3 -\nedition of Purposes and Functions, published in October of last year, offers a detailed\nand comprehensive account of what, why, and how the Fed carries out its different\nresponsibilities. I think it is a wonderful resource for teaching about the Fed, and copies\nare available via the Board’s website.1\nEach of the Fed’s Reserve Banks has community outreach and educational\ninitiatives in the areas of the country they serve, and the outreach to economics teachers\nis coordinated by the group chaired by Amy Hennessy, the Federal Reserve System\nEconomic Education Group.\nAt the Board, we have for some years operated a program called FedEd, which\nsends Fed employees into schools throughout the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area\nand sponsors events for students here at the Eccles Building.2 FedEd’s outreach to\nschools depends on the time and sacrifice of several dozen research assistants, who are\ntypically recent college graduates who work for two or three years at the Board.\nResearch assistants who volunteer for FedEd visit schools; help teach about the Fed,\neconomics, and finance; and answer questions about work opportunities at the Board.\nThe Federal Reserve is committed to promoting diversity in our ranks and in the\neconomics profession, and FedEd has furthered these goals by making sure to include\nschools with significant numbers of minority students.\nThis past school year, FedEd sent research assistants into nine different schools\nand FedEd volunteers have visited 38 different schools since 2012. FedEd was back in\nschools last fall, drawing from 48 research assistants who volunteered to participate.\n1 Purposes and Functions is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/pf/pf.htm.\n2 More information about FedEd is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/educational-tools/fed-education.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nFedEd also sponsors several speaker events a year that bring students into this Board\nRoom. Students recently heard a presentation from Scott Alvarez, who oversees the\nBoard’s Legal Division, and, in February, Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer will speak to\nstudents at another event. FedEd is overseen by two research assistants, Caroline Shinkle\nand Jamie Lenney, along with Karen Pence, who is an economist at the Board. All three\nare with us this evening and prepared to answer further questions about the program.\nOnline resources for teachers can be found on the Board’s website at\nfederalreserve.gov, and additional resources available throughout the System are at\nfederalreserveeducation.org. The websites include videos in which policymakers and the\nstaff describe the Fed’s functions. Also, the sites include historical materials and a\nwealth of information related to the financial crisis and the Fed’s response.\nLet me leave it there, and again thank teachers for participating in this town hall,\nand offer my thanks, on behalf of the Board of Governors, for the valuable work you do\nevery day. I would be very happy to respond to your questions.",

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nAt\nCommunity Banking in the 21st Century\nThe Third Annual Community Banking Research and Policy Conference\nCosponsored by the Federal Reserve System and Conference of State Bank Supervisors\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nSt. Louis, Missouri\nSeptember 30, 2015\n\nThank you. It is truly a pleasure for me to join President Bullard and Chairman\nCotney in welcoming you to the Community Banking Research and Policy Conference,\nwhich I am proud to say has been cosponsored since its inception by the Federal Reserve\nSystem and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS).\nThis is the third year for this conference, which I consider a milestone. The first\ntime you organize a conference like this, all you can be sure about is that there was\nindeed enough research and interest for such a conference. The second time it is held,\nyou proved that you could do it again.\nBut the third year, this year, is when we can start to feel we have established a\ntradition. If this year’s conference comes even close to being as successful as the first\ntwo were, and I expect it will be, I hope that we have established an ongoing role for this\ngathering, which provides such a great opportunity for bankers, regulators, and academic\nresearchers to come together to share ideas and insights about the issues that matter most\nin community banking.\nBased on the agenda and conference materials I have seen, I expect participants\nover the next two days will tackle some of the most important issues facing community\nbanks, provoke discussion and debate about opportunities and challenges, and generate\nsome promising ideas about how community banks can continue to play the\nindispensable role they have played in so many communities. The lineup of speakers,\nwhich includes my Federal Reserve Board colleague, Governor Brainard, is impressive.\nShe and others will delve deeply into the important research questions and other issues\nfacing community banking.\n\n- 2 -\nMy role today is to welcome you on behalf of the Federal Reserve Board. In the\ninterest of getting to the important work of this conference, I will be brief, but if I\naccomplish anything by speaking to you today, I hope it is to convey the Board’s\nunderstanding of the unique and important role of community banks in our financial\nsystem as well as the Board’s commitment, at the highest level, to consider how our\nsupervisory and regulatory decisions affect those institutions.\nMy fellow Board members and I know that community banks provide essential\nfinancial services to households, small businesses, and farms in communities throughout\nthe country. We know that community banks serve many customers that large banks do\nnot and provide services that are not offered by large banks in many communities. This\ncircumstance is especially true in rural areas and other small communities, where\ncommunity banks are sometimes the only retail financial institutions.\nWe understand that community bankers serve members of their local communities\nwho are not just their customers, but also their neighbors and their friends. We know the\nstrong links these banks have to the people and businesses in their communities provide\nfirsthand knowledge of local economic conditions. My colleagues on the Board\nunderstand, as I do, that these close ties give community bankers special insight and\nunderstanding into local needs so that they can tailor their products and services to meet\nthose needs.\nAlthough community banks largely kept to their traditional business model of\nprudent, local lending and avoided the excessive risk-tasking that helped fuel the\nfinancial crisis, that crisis, and the deep recession that followed, devastated many\ncommunities and the banks that serve them. The significant improvement in the\n\n- 3 -\neconomy since then has helped communities and community banks, but I am well aware\nthat the challenges for this sector continue, and my Board colleagues understand this also.\nWe know and appreciate these concerns because the Board makes it our business\nto regularly and extensively meet with and talk to community bankers and industry\nleaders. The Board of Governors meets twice a year with the Community Depository\nInstitutions Advisory Council, which includes representatives of community banks,\nthrifts, and credit unions in each of the 12 Federal Reserve Districts.1 The Board also has\na Subcommittee on Smaller Regional and Community Banking, headed by Governor\nPowell and including Governor Brainard.2\nLet me also say that the experiences, aspirations, and challenges of community\nbanking are not new to me. Before I became Chair of the Board of Governors and Vice\nChair before that, I spent six years as president of the San Francisco Fed. In this role, I\nwas responsible for the supervision of a substantial number of community banking\norganizations in the nine states of the 12th District.\nAmong the things I learned from that experience is that, when it comes to bank\nregulation and supervision, one size does not fit all. To effectively promote safety and\nsoundness and ensure consumer compliance without creating undue regulatory burden,\nrules and supervisory approaches should be tailored to different types of institutions.\nThat is why the Congress chose to exempt community banks from many aspects of new,\npost-crisis regulations and why financial regulators, including the Fed, have otherwise\n1 More information on the Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council is available on the\nBoard’s website at www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/cdiac.htm.\n2 Board member assignments are available on the Board’s website at\nwww.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/default.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nrecognized the differences between community banks and larger, more complex\ninstitutions.\nThe Federal Reserve is committed to this approach to community bank oversight\nand to ensuring that new and existing regulations are not unduly burdensome for\ncommunity banks. One way we are fulfilling this commitment is through the regulatory\nreview required by the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act\n(EGRPRA). The Federal Reserve and other agencies involved in the EGRPRA process\nhave so far held four in a series of six planned outreach meetings at locations across the\ncountry. We have heard many comments about community bank concerns and are taking\nthose insights into account as we consider options for alleviating unnecessary regulatory\nburden.\nLet me conclude by returning to the occasion of this conference and what I\nbelieve it says about the Federal Reserve’s commitment to supporting the ongoing role of\ncommunity banking in America.\nIn addition to its responsibilities for monetary policy and financial regulation and\nsupervision, the Federal Reserve takes very seriously its role as a research institution.\nWe believe strongly in the idea that high-quality research can add to knowledge and\nunderstanding and help inform economic and financial policymaking to yield better\ndecisions that benefit society. The Fed instituted this conference in partnership with the\nCSBS because we believe that research can help us better understand the benefits that\ncommunity banks provide to society and the challenges they face. The work presented at\nthis conference and subsequent research that may be spurred by this work can deepen\ncommunity bankers’ understanding of their businesses, and it can help state and federal\n\n- 5 -\nregulators make better-informed decisions. Ultimately, research can help provide\nanswers to how community banks can continue to succeed in the 21st century.\nThank you for this opportunity to speak, welcome to St. Louis, and I hope you\nenjoy the discussions of the next two days.",

    "text": "Speech to Community Leaders Luncheon at the Los Angeles Rotary Club\nLos Angeles, California\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery Friday September 5, 2008, 12:55 PM Pacific, 3:55 PM Eastern\nThe U.S. Economic Situation and the Challenges for Monetary Policy1\nGood afternoon, everyone, and thank you for coming. It’s always a pleasure to\nvisit Los Angeles, where our Reserve Bank has a major branch, and I’m honored by the\ninvitation to speak to you today. My remarks today will focus on conditions in the U.S.\neconomy. There is a lot to cover, but I plan to leave a few minutes for questions and hope\nyou will share with me your own perceptions concerning the economy and its prospects.\nRegrettably, the nation’s economy has been in rough waters for over a year now.\nLast summer, a precipitous slide in house prices triggered a crisis in financial markets and a\ncredit crunch that is making it hard for consumers and some firms to borrow. These\ndevelopments are ongoing and perhaps deepening, as banks and other financial\nintermediaries are continuing to delever by scaling back their balance sheets and shrinking\ntheir lending activity. In the face of these developments, firms and consumers have also\nbeen pulling back, causing unemployment to rise. As if this cycle of events feeding back\non each other weren’t bad enough, oil and other commodity prices have surged in recent\nyears, generating worrisome numbers for headline consumer inflation. So, the problems\nfacing the Fed have been myriad, complex, and difficult. We have had to balance concerns\nabout economic weakness with equally compelling, but conflicting, concerns about\ninflation.\n1 I would like to thank the Economic Research staff for support in preparing these remarks and, in\nparticular, John Judd, Reuven Glick, Rob Valletta, and Judith Goff.\n1\n\nQuite recently, there has been a bit of a shift in the inflation picture, however.\nCommodity prices—most notably oil prices—have fallen well below their earlier peaks. I\nwill argue that this development probably largely reflects a weakening in economic\nconditions in many industrialized countries, including European nations and Japan. By\nreducing the worldwide demand for commodities, weaker global growth should relieve\nupward pressure on U.S. inflation. Lower commodity prices should also be good for U.S.\neconomic growth, although this benefit is likely to be counterbalanced to some degree by\nthe detrimental effects of slower foreign economic growth on our exports, which have been\nsurging. If commodity prices keep falling—or even if they remain at current levels—the\nFed’s objective of promoting both price stability and full employment will become more\nreadily achievable. In the remainder of my remarks, I want to elaborate on these points.\nHousing\nI’ll begin with housing, because the “boom and bust” cycle in the housing market\nwas the trigger for many of the developments I’ll be discussing. The effect of the collapse\nin the national housing market on our economy has been profound. First, outlays for\nresidential construction have been falling at double-digit rates in inflation-adjusted terms\nsince 2005 and this decline has been a huge drag on growth. Slower economic growth has\npushed up the national unemployment rate to 6.1 percent—over a full percentage point\nabove the level that, in my view, is consistent with “full employment.” Going forward, it\nseems unlikely that construction activity will pick up any time soon. Inventories of unsold\nhomes remain at elevated levels, and although home sales have shown signs of leveling off\nrecently—certainly a ray of hope—the volume of sales remains quite weak.\n2\n\nSecond, the drop in house prices—around 15 to 20 percent off its peak depending\non which measure you use—has weakened the financial condition of many consumers.\nThe value of their homes is an important part of their wealth and equity in those homes\nserves as collateral for home equity loans and other types of borrowing. The result is that\nconsumers are likely to spend less, reducing the pace of economic activity. Declining\nhouse prices also appear to be the single biggest factor behind the recent rise in mortgage\ndelinquencies and home foreclosures. When families face financial difficulties due to\nillness, job loss, or divorce, an equity cushion often allows them to get through the hard\ntimes by borrowing needed funds or even selling the house. But when home price declines\nhave wiped out home equity or driven it into negative territory, people often end up in\ndelinquency or foreclosure. The vitality of the subprime mortgage market appeared to\ndepend on continued home price appreciation, and, of course, it is now in shambles with\naround 20 percent of subprime mortgages currently delinquent or in foreclosure\nnationwide. Delinquency rates on prime mortgages are far lower. But they too are on the\nrise.\nThe Los Angeles area is among the regions hardest hit by the national housing\nslump. Except for a slight pickup in recent months, home sales have plummeted over the\npast few years, and depending on the price measure that you use, home prices are down\nabout 15 to 30 percent from their peak.\nNot surprisingly, financial conditions for many homeowners in the area are quite\nshaky. Subprime mortgages accounted for a significant share of new mortgages during the\narea’s housing boom, particularly in downtown Los Angeles and parts of the Inland\nEmpire. Conditions here aren’t as bad as the most exposed areas of the state, such as\n3\n\nMerced and Stockton. However, delinquencies and foreclosures have grown significantly\nin this area, and given the continued weak prognosis for the housing market in general,\nmore unpleasant adjustments in ownership and equity are likely before the market\nstabilizes.\nFinancial Markets\nThe third profound impact of the national housing market collapse has been on\nfinancial markets, and the turmoil that began last August is still alive and well. For\nexample, spreads between the rates that must be paid by risky borrowers over those on\nTreasury securities remain very high. And, as you know, we’ve begun to see a growing\nnumber of failures of depository institutions—notably IndyMac, which represented the\nlargest failure in decades.\nIn addition, many financial markets are still not operating efficiently or effectively.\nIn particular, the market for so-called private-label securitized mortgages of even the\nhighest quality remains moribund. These complex instruments were the primary source of\nfinancing for nonconforming residential mortgages, including subprime loans.\nOutside of expanded lending by the FHA, there is now little or no lending to\nhigher-risk residential mortgage borrowers. Jumbo mortgages for prime borrowers are\navailable, but at historically high spreads over rates on conventional mortgages, as banks\nhave been reluctant to make these loans. Beyond higher rates, many depositories are\ntightening the terms of their lending, capping or terminating some home equity loans, and\nin general trying to reduce their exposure to credit losses by reducing the scale of their\nlending. Importantly, the government-sponsored agencies—Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,\nthe largest of all mortgage lenders—have suffered credit losses and are having to pare back\n4\n\ntheir crucial roles in the mortgage market. The result of all of this is a severe economy-\nwide credit crunch, comparable to the one that hit the economy in the recession of the early\n1990s.\nThe story of how falling house prices, and, in particular, their effects on the\nsubprime mortgage market, triggered the problems in financial markets is well-known. At\nthe most basic level, financial market participants suddenly realized that house price\ndeclines could result in substantial losses on subprime mortgages through delinquencies\nand foreclosures, that the extent of those losses was highly uncertain, and that the\ncomplexity of mortgage-backed securities and the collateralized debt obligations\nincorporating them made it difficult to know which participants would suffer the losses.\nThe story of how these problems will ultimately be resolved is far less clear.\nObviously, it would help a lot if house prices stopped falling. But even though the rate of\ndecline of house prices has shown signs of moderating, it appears that these prices will\nkeep heading down for some time. The ratio of house prices to rents—a kind of price-\ndividend ratio for housing—still remains high by historical standards, despite having fallen\nsubstantially from its historical peak in early 2006. This suggests that further price\ndeclines are needed to bring housing markets into long-run balance. Moreover, large\ninventories of unsold homes can be expected to continue to put downward pressure on\nhousing prices. In view of these factors, it’s not surprising that the futures market for\nhouse prices predicts further declines this year.\nGoing forward, the ability and willingness of commercial banks and other\nintermediaries to extend credit depends in part on their capital levels. Capital has been\ndepleted by large losses, but it is encouraging that financial institutions have raised a\n5\n\nconsiderable amount of new capital over the past year. Even so, balance sheet pressures\nand broader financial market dislocations may well be with us for some time. My guess is\nthat market functioning will improve in 2009, but things could get worse before they get\nbetter. One major concern is that home prices could fall more than markets now expect,\nleading to larger losses for financial institutions, which would further impair their ability to\nmake new loans. The deepening of the credit crunch could then lead to further declines in\nhouse prices, intensifying the adverse feedback loop that seems to be operating in our\neconomy.\nCommodities\nBeyond the many repercussions of falling house prices, another factor putting a\ndamper on economic activity has been surging prices for commodities, including energy,\nfood and metals. There’s plenty of debate about where this surge in commodity prices\ncame from. Some have argued that speculative trading in commodity markets is the main\ncause but, personally, I’m not persuaded by that explanation. I’m more persuaded by\narguments based on the fundamentals of demand and supply—and I think they explain not\nonly much of the run-up in commodity prices, but also the recent declines. In the run-up,\ndemand was boosted by rapid worldwide economic growth, with China and other\ndeveloping countries accounting for a good deal of the increase. At the same time, new\nsupplies of oil have been harder to come by. As for food prices, supply has been\nconstrained by a number of factors, including drought conditions that hampered wheat\nproduction in Australia, and demand for biofuels that has diverted crops away from food\nusage.\n6\n\nThe fundamental forces of supply and demand can also explain the drop in energy\nand some other commodity prices since June. Most important is that the demand for\ncommodities has probably fallen in response to a weakening of economic growth in many\nindustrialized countries. In the second quarter, it was only barely positive in the 30-country\nOECD bloc as a whole, and Japan, France, Germany and Italy all experienced outright\ncontractions. Moreover, prospects for growth do not appear to be that good for the second\nhalf of this year.\nSeveral factors are behind the worsening outlook abroad. First, as in the U.S.,\nhigher oil and food prices have cut into consumer spending. Second, although most of\nEurope had little subprime lending of its own, deteriorating U.S. financial market\nconditions have affected banks and markets abroad that invested in structured products\noriginated in the U.S.; this is particularly true for banks in the United Kingdom,\nSwitzerland, Germany, and France. As in the U.S., this exposure has led to higher funding\ncosts, tighter bank lending standards, and wider spreads for riskier borrowers. Third,\nseveral countries, including Spain, Ireland, and the U.K., have experienced their own\nhousing booms and downturns, creating further stress on their banking sectors. Fourth,\nslower growth in the U.S. and the depreciation of the dollar against their currencies have\ndampened European and Japanese exports.\nFinally, monetary policy in Europe has been less accommodative during this period\nthan in the U.S. For example, while the Fed cut its target interest rate substantially to 2\npercent during the course of the credit crisis that began last summer, the European Central\nBank kept its policy interest rate steady throughout, and then tightened by 25 basis points\nto 4¼ percent in July. Part of the reason for the difference is that the European Central\n7\n\nBank’s mandate requires it to focus exclusively on controlling headline inflation, which\nreached 4 percent for the twelve months ending in July—a rate well above its official\nobjective of below, but close to, 2 percent. In addition, even though much of the recent\nincrease in inflation is attributable to commodity prices, and therefore likely to be a\ntemporary phenomenon, the central bank has been worried about second-round effects on\ninflation expectations, wages, and other costs, and justifiably so. The euro zone has a\ngreater degree of wage indexation and collective bargaining than the U.S. So it is more\nlikely that higher headline inflation will fairly quickly get built into wages there, setting off\na wage-price spiral that could be persistent and difficult to stop.\nU.S. Outlook\nTurning back to our own economy now, it was recently reported that growth in the\nsecond quarter came in at a fairly robust rate of 3¼ percent. And this seems like good\nnews—especially considering what the economy has just been through. Growth slowed\nsharply in the fourth quarter of last year, and, indeed, the data show that activity actually\ncontracted slightly. Though growth turned positive in the first quarter, it was tepid at best.\nWhile one might be tempted to interpret the recent strong numbers as a sign that\nthings are turning around, there are three important reasons to think that the strength will\nnot hold up, and that economic performance will be decidedly subpar in the second half of\nthe year. First, consumer spending in the second quarter came in at only a moderate rate,\neven though it was boosted by substantial tax rebates. But there are no plans in place to\nrepeat those rebates, so by the fourth quarter, the economy will no longer benefit from that\nfiscal stimulus.\n8\n\nSecond, export growth alone contributed one-half of the total real GDP growth\nregistered in the second quarter. This element has been an important source of strength in\nour economy for over a year, buoyed by strong growth abroad and by the weakening of the\ndollar. However, the dollar has rebounded some in recent months and, as I noted,\neconomic growth in many of our industrialized trading partners has slowed or even turned\nnegative, suggesting that exports will no longer give much of a boost to the pace of our\neconomic growth.\nThird, the problems in the housing markets, financial markets, and labor markets\ncontinue to be a drag on growth and employment. Fortunately, the recent fall in\ncommodity prices should help to cushion some of this downward pressure on activity.\nOverall, I anticipate that real GDP growth in the second half of this year will come\nin below the growth of potential output, which implies that the unemployment rate will rise\nfurther. On its own, this obviously is not good news. And its interaction with the housing\nand financial markets raises the potential for worse news—a deepening of the adverse\nfeedback loop I’ve been describing: more unemployment causing more people to fall\nbehind on their mortgage payments, leading to further delinquencies and foreclosures,\ntighter credit conditions and further downward pressure on activity and employment. This\nkind of process represents a downside risk for the economy, and today’s jump in the\nunemployment rate highlights that risk.\nFinally, let me turn to inflation where recent performance has been a serious\nconcern. As of July, the headline PCE Price Index—a comprehensive measure of\nconsumer prices—was up by a whopping 4¼ percent over the past year, compared to 2½\npercent over the prior year. An important reason why inflation was so high, of course, was\n9\n\nbecause of the steep increases we experienced in food and energy prices. On top of that,\nthe rise in commodity prices boosted the costs of the wide array of businesses that use them\nas inputs and some have responded by passing those cost increases through to their own\nprices. The consequence is that core inflation, which excludes food and energy is also up.\nThe core PCE Price Index rose by 2½ percent over the past twelve months, which is\nsomewhat above the range that I consider consistent with price stability, but close to its\npace of increase over the last several years.\nAs bad as inflation has been, I am very hopeful that inflation will come down quite\nsubstantially, though perhaps not as fast as I’d like; we probably need to live through\nanother quarter or two of higher inflation, as previous increases in commodity prices boost\nthe prices paid by consumers for food and energy.\nOne reason for inflation to come down thereafter is the recent decline in commodity\nprices. As long as they don’t keep going up, they will cease to put direct upward pressure\non headline inflation. Furthermore, the slack we now have in labor and product markets\nwill impart some downward pressure on the growth of labor compensation. The pace of\nwage and salary increases has been stable and quite modest in recent years and a weak\nlabor market may cause it to decline even further.\nAnother important factor in the inflation outlook is inflation expectations. If the\npublic were to conclude that the recent experience of high inflation will be long-lasting and\nnot temporary, then workers might demand higher compensation and firms might satisfy\nthose demands, setting off a wage-price dynamic that would be costly to unwind. I argued\nearlier that such a wage-price spiral was less likely here than in Europe because our\n10\n\neconomy has less wage indexation than exists in the euro area. However, that does not\nmean that we can afford to ignore the risk that such a damaging spiral could develop here.\nFortunately, I do not see signs of this development at this point. Outside of a few\nbooming sectors such as energy, there are no real signs of escalating wage pressures and\nthe two broad measures of national labor compensation that we monitor have shown\nremarkably small increases recently and over the past year. Taking productivity growth\ninto account, growth in labor costs per unit of output in the overall economy has been quite\nmodest. Moreover, various measures of longer-term inflation expectations suggest that\nthey remain relatively well contained. In summary, it seems clear that inflation risks have\ndiminished somewhat in recent months as commodity prices have come down from their\nhighs. But they have by no means disappeared and are very much at the forefront of the\nFOMC’s attention.\nMonetary Policy\nThis brings me to my views on monetary policy. The Committee responded to the\ndifficult economic conditions that emerged last year by easing monetary policy\nsubstantially, cutting the federal funds rate to 2 percent, which is more than 3 full\npercentage points below where it was just last summer. Although this rate is low by\nhistorical standards, I still don’t consider the stance of monetary policy to be excessively\nstimulatory. In light of all of the disruptions to the financial system I described, I consider\nfinancial conditions to be more restrictive overall now than when the financial crisis struck\na year ago. Policy must be calibrated to push through the substantial headwinds the\neconomy faces.\n11\n\nSo, to summarize the outlook, while the economy did well in the second quarter,\nthat strength is unfortunately likely to prove ephemeral. I anticipate sluggish growth in the\nsecond half of this year. Overall inflation over the past year has been unacceptably high.\nBut, the prognosis for the not too distant future is favorable. The recent drop in commodity\nprices has improved the policy choice facing the Committee. However, going forward, it is\nclear that we must keep a close eye on both inflation and inflation expectations to ensure\nthat we continue to earn the inflation credibility that we have built up over the past two and\na half decades.\n12",

    "text": "Speech to the Northern California Regional Financial Planning Conference\nSan Francisco, California\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on May 27, 2008, 8:50 AM Pacific time, 11:50 AM Eastern\nCredit, Housing, Commodities, and the Economy1\nGood morning. I’m delighted to be part of the Northern California Regional\nFinancial Planning conference this year. I’d like to thank the organizers for inviting me\nand for giving me an opportunity to talk about the U.S. economy and the conduct of\nmonetary policy to such a large and knowledgeable group of professionals. Most, if not\nall, of you have been first-hand witnesses to one of the most significant economic shocks\nin our memories—one that is seriously affecting the U.S. outlook. I mean, of course, the\nevents that have been roiling U.S. and global financial markets since midsummer of last\nyear and that have led to the current credit crunch.\nIn my assessment of the economy, I will also focus on two additional factors that\nare shaping the outlook—the downturn in housing markets and the unanticipated surge in\nfood, oil, and other commodity prices. These developments have taken a toll on the U.S.\neconomy, resulting in weak growth since late last year. To preview my discussion, I\nexpect that the economy’s performance will improve somewhat in the second half of the\nyear. But I am also well aware that the risks surrounding my forecast are large because\nof uncertainty about how these three factors—the financial turmoil, the housing cycle,\nand commodity prices—will evolve. Before I begin, let me note, as usual, that these\n1 I am deeply indebted to staff in the Economic Research Department of the Federal Reserve Bank of San\nFrancisco, and in particular to John Judd and Judith Goff, for their support in preparing these remarks and\nto Laurie Glapa for outstanding research assistance.\n\nremarks reflect my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal\nReserve System.\nFinancial Markets and the Credit Crunch\nLet me turn first to the financial market turmoil. From a monetary policy\nperspective, one of its most important consequences is the serious credit crunch that has\ndeveloped. Stories about the credit crunch are in the news every day, and they highlight\nhow widespread its effects are. Students are finding it harder to obtain college loans.\nHouseholds are more often receiving notice that their home equity lines have been\ncapped. Companies report that it is more challenging to secure credit lines from their\nbanks. Some municipal governments and nonprofits have experienced unexpected jumps\nin interest payments on their debt due to disruptions in their funding markets.\nHomeowners seeking jumbo mortgages face interest rates that have risen since last\nsummer, even though both short- and long-term Treasury rates have declined\nsubstantially. And subprime mortgages are all but unavailable at any price.\nHow did such a situation come about? To my mind, it represents a rapid and\ndisruptive unwinding of a bubble-like situation that had developed in credit markets over\na number of years. At the time, many observers noted that the world appeared to be\n“awash in liquidity.” The “bubble” was characterized by very low long-term real interest\nrates. Investors seemed willing to accept very modest compensation for the risks they\nwere taking. The abundance of liquidity was reflected in a number of investment\nstrategies. For example, a wave of leveraged buyouts was financed at low interest rates\nwith exceptionally favorable terms. Substantial quantities of funds were also attracted\n2\n\ninto so-called “carry trades” involving exposure to significant exchange rate risk. And,\nmost importantly, there was a rapid rise in lending on home mortgages in general, and\nimportantly, in the subprime mortgage market, reflecting an exceptionally benign view of\nthe underlying risks.\nThis benign view may well have been linked, in part, to rapid transformations\ntaking place in our financial system. Securitization and financial engineering\nfundamentally changed financial markets in a relatively short period of time, appearing to\nmake it possible to slice and dice and spread risk more effectively—indeed, it appeared\nthat these innovations had made the usual terms of the risk-return tradeoff more\nfavorable.2 The surge in lending occurred as securitization promulgated the originate-to-\ndistribute business model—that is, underlying loans were securitized and sold to\ninvestors. Notably, the main compensation of many participants in the securitization\nchain came in the form of upfront origination fees. Without the strong incentives to\nmaintain underwriting standards that exist when originating institutions keep loans on\ntheir own books, the credit quality of many of the securitized loans deteriorated\nsignificantly. Subprime mortgages are a good example, as combined loan-to-value ratios\nand the percentage of low- or “no-doc” loans rose steadily through 2006. And, in any\ncase, even subprime mortgages looked like a good bet, with house prices seeming to be\non an ever-upward march.\nFurthermore, with the economy booming, investors, including highly leveraged\ninvestment banks, hedge funds, and SIVs (structured investment vehicles)—the so-called\n“shadow banking sector”—were actively seeking projects to finance and willing to\nincrease their leverage. With interest rates so low, they were motivated to reach for\n2 Rajan (2008)\n3\n\nhigher yields on these projects.3 Many investors found reassurance in getting involved in\nmany of these complex securities by relying on the evaluations given by rating agencies.\nUnfortunately, these ratings turned out not to be very reliable.\nSo long as house prices kept soaring, as they did until a couple of years ago, these\ncredit problems did not show up. But once house prices flattened out and then began to\nfall, it became clear that delinquencies and foreclosures on subprime and other mortgages\nwould be far higher than had been anticipated. This arguably was the trigger of a far\nbroader reappraisal of credit market risks and attitudes.\nClearly, the market discipline that “sophisticated investors” are supposed to\nprovide was lacking. As we saw, even some of the largest, most sophisticated financial\ninstitutions inadequately incorporated into their risk-management models the full range of\nhazards entailed in the originate-to-distribute business and the liquidity risks that would\nresult from a drying up of short-term funding. Also lacking were reliable ratings from the\nagencies. But financial supervisors and regulators, including the Federal Reserve, were\nbehind the curve, as well. We missed some of the risky developments that were\nunfolding. Our consumer regulations were unfortunately insufficient to protect\nhouseholds from some egregious and unfair lending practices. And we took too long to\nramp up some supervisory policies in the face of mounting risks. On a broader level, the\nsituation exposed holes in the existing regulatory framework for financial services, which\nallowed some risky activities to flourish, hurting both consumers and financial stability.\nSignificantly, the Fed was compelled to open the discount window to investment banks\nbecause of the outsized risks some took and their significant interconnectedness with the\n3 Adrian and Shin (2008)\n4\n\nfinancial market infrastructure. Investment banks thus were able to operate with less\ncapital and supervision than such access otherwise entails.\nNow that I’ve taken a broad view of the crisis, let me go into some of the more\nspecific developments that influence my views on the economy and monetary policy.\nGiven the importance of the subprime market in initiating the crisis and its relevance to\nthe broader housing market, I would like to spend a few minutes at the outset reviewing\nwhat happened there before returning to the main “story line” concerning the financial\nturmoil. This market took off after 2001 and, by one estimate, in late 2007 there were\nover 7 million subprime mortgages outstanding, or about 14 percent of the overall\nmortgage market. Through late 2005, things seemed to be going well, with subprime\ndelinquencies remarkably low in most areas of the country. But now, close to 20 percent\nof subprime mortgages are delinquent or in foreclosure nationwide.\nResearch suggests that it was not so much interest rate resets that triggered the\nrise in subprime problems, as many expected. Indeed, reductions in short-term interest\nrates since the onset of the crisis should diminish the danger of foreclosures from such\nresets going forward. Rather, the single most important determinant of the level and\nchange in subprime delinquency rates has been the pace of house price changes.4\nThe link between house prices and delinquency rates is not surprising. Although\ndelinquencies and foreclosures are often precipitated by life crises, such as illness,\ndivorce, or the loss of a job, the amount of equity in the home affects the ability or\nwillingness of a homeowner to keep current on their mortgage payments when these\nevents occur. In a market in which house prices have been stagnant or declining, a\n4 Doms, Furlong, and Krainer (2007a, b), Demyanyk and van Hemert (2008), Gerardi, Shapiro, and Willen\n(2007), and FRBSF 2007 Annual Report (2008).\n5\n\nborrower with a recent mortgage secured with little or no down payment does not have\nthe flexibility to refinance or to tap into the equity in the house to weather a life event.\nEven some borrowers who might be able to afford their loans may be unwilling to make\nthe payments if house prices are expected to remain low or decline putting their\nmortgages underwater. Declining house prices have also affected prime borrowers.\nWhile default rates on prime mortgages are lower than for adjustable-rate subprime loans,\ndelinquency rates among all categories are highly correlated with house price declines\nacross regions of the country.\nRising delinquencies on subprime mortgages triggered huge disruptions in the\nmarkets for asset-backed securities (ABS) and these problems are central to the\nemergence of the credit crunch. Because most subprime mortgages were packaged into\nmortgage backed securities (MBS), and into the more complex collections called\ncollateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, surging credit losses, and prospects for further\nlosses, meant lower values for all of the securities that were based on them. Losses\nrelated to the subprime market even inflicted collateral damage on a completely unrelated\nmarket—the market for municipal bonds. Some companies that insure these bonds had\nexposure to the subprime market as well, precipitating downgrades in their credit ratings\nor the potential for such downgrades in the future.\nThe problems afflicting mortgage-related ABS spread to some other classes of\nABS as well. Many types of underlying loans, including credit card, commercial real\nestate, auto, business and student loans, had been packaged into such securities. The\ncontagion to these sectors occurred for a variety of reasons, including a general flight to\nsafety by now-risk-averse investors; the recognition that similar, although less\n6\n\npronounced, declines in underwriting standards may have occurred in some other credit\nareas such as commercial real estate and leveraged lending; widespread concern about the\nvalidity of the evaluations of securities that had been issued by the rating agencies; and a\ndrying up of short-term funding for a set of vehicles and institutions that were significant\ninvestors in these securities.\nLosses from holding asset-backed securities have been suffered by a broad range\nof investors. As it turns out though, a large share of the exposure resided with\ncommercial banks, with nonbank subsidiaries of financial holding companies, and with\nthe highly leveraged entities in the “shadow banking sector.” Write-downs on ABS\nreduced the equity cushions in all of these firms and increased their leverage at a time\nwhen the growing risks in the financial markets made them desire less leverage, not\nmore. Some commercial banks suffered additionally because they had an unanticipated\nbuildup of mortgages and loans related to leveraged buyouts on their balance sheets.\nBecause they were active securitizers themselves, these loans were in the pipeline for\nsecuritization but could not be sold. In addition, when SIVs they had sponsored were in\ndanger of failing, some banks decided to rescue them by taking the underlying assets\nback onto their own balance sheets. All of these factors raised banks’ own leverage\nlevels and diminished their capital cushions. Many banks are raising additional capital,\nbut most are also tightening credit terms and restricting availability of loans to many\nhouseholds and businesses. For example, the Federal Reserve’s Senior Loan Officers\nSurvey documents a broad-based tightening in terms and reduction in the availability of\ncredit since last summer.\n7\n\nAt the same time that availability of bank funding has tightened, new issuance of\nasset-backed securities has all but disappeared as a viable funding option for several\ntypes of borrowing. In particular, the markets for securities backed by private-label\nmortgages, commercial mortgages, and leveraged loans have all become quite illiquid as\na consequence of the turmoil. As leveraged institutions sought to strengthen their balance\nsheets and, in some cases, meet margin calls, by selling ABS, asset prices declined,\nexacerbating losses and escalating the market pressures in a vicious cycle, making it\nalmost impossible, in some cases, to determine appropriate prices for the securities.\nIlliquidity and higher risk premia have also afflicted the money markets that serve\nas sources of short-term funding for banks, a further factor reducing their willingness to\nlend. Banks are accustomed to borrowing in the term interbank markets from one\nanother to manage liquidity. However, many banks that normally borrow and lend to\neach other, have become reluctant to lend. This presumably reflects recognition of the\nneed to preserve their own liquidity to meet unexpected credit demands and greater\nuncertainty about the creditworthiness of counterparties.\nEven as we move beyond those portions of the credit markets dominated by bank\nlending and loan securitization, we still see evidence of tighter credit conditions. For\nexample, in the corporate bond market, which is still functioning fairly well, spreads\nfacing all borrowers have risen. Riskier borrowers, issuing low-grade corporate bonds,\nface higher rates even though a worldwide “flight to safety,” coupled with an easing of\nmonetary policy by the Fed, has contributed to a sharp decline in interest rates on\nTreasury securities since last June. The increase in spreads presumably reflects both\n8\n\nhigher risk aversion among investors and heightened perceptions of the possible\ndownside risks to firms that would result from a weaker economy.\nAt the end of March, the credit market stresses I have described actually escalated\nto the point where they posed the risk of a systemic meltdown. In particular, the Bear\nStearns episode showed how concerns about credit quality and solvency for an\nintermediary can devolve into liquidity problems. The fear that Bear Stearns would be\nunable to meet its obligations to its creditors triggered a sudden withdrawal of credit—as\nin an old- fashioned bank run. Of course, the perceived inability of one institution to\nmeet its obligations is likely to cast doubt on the ability of others to meet theirs,\ntriggering chains of distress and systemic risk.\nThe Federal Reserve was created precisely to stem such systemic risks by acting\nas a lender of last resort, although not since the Great Depression has it acted to\naccomplish it by lending directly through its discount window to an entity other than a\ndepository institution. Had the Fed not intervened, however, Bear Stearns would have\nbeen unable to meet the demands of the counterparties in its repurchase agreements and\nthus intended to file for bankruptcy. Doing so might well have led to widespread fears in\nthe financial markets, with declining prices for asset-backed securities triggering margin\ncalls, forced selling pushing prices down further, and mark-to-market losses triggering\nreductions in capital and escalating problems in other highly leveraged institutions. The\nFed’s recent decision to set up a facility to provide credit to other primary dealers reflects\nthe potential of this important group of institutions to create systemic risk with\nunacceptable consequences for the economy as a whole.\n9\n\nIn addition to the actions with respect to Bear Stearns and the Primary Dealer\nCredit Facility, the Fed has responded in a number of ways to improve and protect market\nliquidity. We’ve lowered the spread of the discount rate above the federal funds rate\nfrom 100 to 25 basis points; created a new auction facility to make term loans to banks\nbased on a broader range of collateral (the Term Auction Facility); set up another facility\nto lend Treasury securities in exchange for certain asset-backed securities (the Term\nSecurities Lending Facility); engaged in term repurchase agreements with primary\ndealers; and approved swaps with the ECB and Swiss National Bank to enable them to\nincrease dollar liquidity to institutions in their markets.\nThese liquidity-enhancing actions are different from standard monetary policy\nbecause they do not involve changes in the federal funds rate—the Fed’s monetary policy\ntarget—and, unlike open market operations, they do not entail any change in the size of\nthe Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. Instead, they involve a change in the composition of\nthe Fed’s roughly $800 billion balance sheet away from outright ownership of U.S.\nTreasury securities and toward, for example, both short-term and term loans backed by a\nwider range of collateral to both depository institutions and primary dealers.\nI believe that the Fed’s liquidity operations, combined with its 325-basis-point cut\nin the federal funds rate—a substantial easing of monetary policy—are having a\nbeneficial effect on financial markets. Although overall financial conditions are still far\nfrom normal, there are some rays of hope that the strains may be easing a bit. Over the\npast couple of months, for example, spreads in the markets for conventional GSE-\nsponsored securitized mortgages and in corporate borrowing markets have declined.\nMoreover, credit default swap spreads on many exposed financial institutions, a measure\n10\n\nof their perceived chance of default, are down substantially. Treasury rates have moved\nup, suggesting reduced aversion to risk. And the major stock indexes have regained some\nground.\nHousing\nNow let me turn to the second of the three main factors behind the current\neconomic weakness—namely, the housing cycle. I have mentioned that earlier in this\ndecade when financial markets were “awash in liquidity,” bubble-like conditions\nemerged in many areas of the economy, including housing. During this period, housing\nconstruction was very strong and housing prices soared. In fact, the ratio of house prices\nto rents—a kind of price-dividend ratio for housing—reached historical highs by early\n2006, suggesting that house prices might be well above those that could be justified by\nfundamentals.\nSince then, housing markets have “hit the skids.” In inflation-adjusted terms,\nresidential construction fell by 13 percent in 2006 and by 14 percent in the first half of\nlast year. Of course, once the financial shock hit last summer, things got even worse,\nwith real residential construction dropping at a 24 percent rate on average since then.\nAnd, indicators of conditions in housing markets are pointing lower for the future.\nHousing starts and permits as well as sales are trending down, and inventories of unsold\nhomes remain at very high levels. These inventories will need to be worked off before\nconstruction can begin to rebound.\nI’ve already discussed the precipitous fall in house prices nationally, so it’s\nstriking to note that, even with these declines, the ratio of house prices to rents remains\n11\n\nquite high by historical standards. That, of course, suggests that further price declines\nmay be needed to bring housing markets into balance. This perspective is reinforced by\nfutures markets for house prices, which expect further declines in a number of\nmetropolitan areas this year. In particular, the Case-Shiller composite index for home\nprices shows a 15 to 20 percent year-over-year decline in the second half of this year.\nThe bottom line is that construction spending and house prices seem likely to\ncontinue to decline well into 2009.\nCommodity Prices\nThe behavior of commodity prices is the final of the three factors that lie behind\nour economic troubles. Prices for many commodities, not only crude oil, but also many\nmetals and foods, have risen sharply in recent years. On the demand side, pressure is\ncoming from several quarters. World real GDP growth has been exceptionally robust in\nrecent years, and the strength of demand has been particularly notable in the large\nemerging economies of China and India. In addition, biofuel production has added to\ndemand for some food commodities, like corn, and this has shifted demands to other\nfoods, raising their prices as well. Finally, some commentators have argued that\ncommodity prices have been pushed up by investors shifting demands to commodities in\nthe face of the current financial turmoil as debt and equity investments appear much\nriskier. However, if this factor were playing a significant role, I would expect to see big\nincreases in inventories of commodities as investors were expecting to make profits on\nrising prices. So far, I have not seen the evidence that this is occurring.\n12\n\nNormally, commodity price increases are transitory, in part because they elicit a\nstrong increase in supply that reverses the upward pressure on prices. But today,\nespecially for oil, supplies are increasingly coming from unconventional and more\nexpensive sources, so the supply responses tend to be smaller and to have longer lags. In\nthe case of food, government policies in the U.S. that have stimulated the production of\nbiofuels promise to maintain tight market conditions. Indeed, futures markets and some\nforecasts—for example, the IMF World Economic Outlook—expect many commodity\nprices to remain at around their current high levels rather than reverse course.\nOutlook for the economy\nThese three factors—the credit crunch, the deflating housing bubble, and the\nrising price of commodities—have combined to weigh heavily on demand by both\nconsumers and businesses. Let me start with consumer spending, which is the largest\nsector of the economy. National surveys show that consumer sentiment has plummeted,\nan indication of the many hurdles households face. Consumer spending slowed in the first\nquarter to only 1 percent growth from 2½ percent last year. Falling house prices have\nreduced household spending by lowering total wealth and the value of mortgage equity.\nIn addition, consumers face constraints due to declines in the stock market and tighter\nlending terms at depository institutions. The rise in delinquency rates across the\nspectrum of consumer loans is strongly indicative of the growing strains on households.\nAnd, the rise in the prices of energy, food, and other commodity prices have “taxed” the\ndisposable incomes of households and weighed on consumer spending. Yet another\nnegative factor is that labor markets have weakened. In recent months, growth in\n13\n\nnonfarm payroll employment slowed sharply, actually falling by 260,000 jobs over the\npast four months. Job loss will have a negative impact on the disposable income\navailable to households and therefore will provide an additional restraint on consumer\nspending.\nAs for business investment in equipment and software, this category registered a\ndecline in the first quarter following years of strong growth, and it would not be\nsurprising to see this weakness continue into next year. Nonresidential investment also\ndropped in the first quarter and is likely to face more problems as the year progresses\nsince the securitized finance markets used to finance these expenditures have all but dried\nup.\nFortunately, there are some countervailing factors helping to mitigate the\nsubstantial drags on the U.S. economy. U.S. exports have been strong, as foreign real\nGDP has advanced robustly over the past few years and as the falling dollar has made\nU.S. goods more competitive in global markets. I expect our net exports to continue to\nmake a positive contribution to U.S. growth. However, this result is not assured, as some\ncountries—especially in Europe—are suffering from the turmoil in financial markets, and\nthe sluggishness in the U.S. economy is likely to have a dampening effect on many\neconomies abroad.\nEconomic policies in this country are also likely to provide a boost to growth. As\nI have mentioned, the FOMC has eased the stance of monetary policy substantially in the\npast six months, and I would expect these actions to contribute most strongly to growth in\nthe second half of this year. Moreover, the fiscal stimulus package signed into law\nrecently is well timed, and I am hopeful that this action will have a substantial\n14\n\nstimulatory effect. The rebates to households in 2008 will total more than $100 billion,\nwith more than half of that amount set for distribution in May. Of course, the effects of\nthe program on GDP will depend on the fraction of the money that is spent. In this\nregard, there is reason for optimism. First, the fact that we are in the midst of a credit\ncrunch means that a higher portion of the population is credit constrained than usual, and\nthis means that more of the rebates are likely to be spent. Second, the design of the\nprogram puts emphasis on channeling more of the money to lower-income households\nwho are more likely to be credit constrained in any event. The main effects of the\nprogram are likely to hit in the current and next quarters, and they could be substantial.\nThis brings me to my bottom line for the outlook. The economy slowed starting\nin the fourth quarter. With stimulus from monetary and fiscal policy, economic\nperformance seems likely to improve later this year. With the unemployment rate\ncurrently at 5 percent, it is a little above my estimate of its sustainable level, and the\nsluggish performance I expect this year is likely to push unemployment up further.\nForecasting is always an uncertain business. But I want to emphasize that we are\nfacing a high degree of uncertainty at the present time. One only has to look at the latest\nBlue Chip forecasts to see that point. The range between the highest and lowest forecasts\nfor real GDP growth is among the largest on record. The ten most optimistic forecasters\nare predicting over 2½ percentage points faster growth over the next four quarters than\nthe ten most pessimistic ones.\nOutlook for inflation\nNow let me turn to inflation. Much of the recent data have been disappointing.\nOver the past twelve months, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index\n15\n\nrose 3.2 percent, up from 2.5 percent over the prior year. An important reason for these\ndisappointing numbers, of course, is the rise in commodity prices that I have discussed.\nSome of this increase has probably also passed through to core PCE price inflation,\nwhich excludes food and energy. This measure has averaged 2.1 percent over the past\ntwelve months, and it is slightly above the range that I consider consistent with price\nstability.\nUnder present circumstances, judging future changes in commodity prices is\nobviously an important part of any inflation forecast. As I noted, future markets\ngenerally are expecting these prices to flatten out and remain at around today’s very high\nlevels. If this happens, then the effects of commodity prices on inflation will dissipate.\nIn order to continue to put upward pressure on inflation—which, after all, is the rate of\nchange of prices—commodity prices would have to do more than remain at today’s high\nlevels. They would need to keep on rising.\nWhile this seems unlikely based on experience in recent decades, we can’t rule\nout this possibility. Futures markets have been expecting a leveling out of most\ncommodity prices for several years now, and they keep being surprised by ongoing\nincreases. As I mentioned before, in part, this could reflect growing supply limitations on\nsome commodities, especially oil. However, there also is the possibility that commodity\nprices could fall in the future as the economic weakness in the U.S. and slowing in\nEurope could spread to the rest of the world, reining in demand for commodities. I\nmentioned before that there is an unusually wide spread in Blue Chip forecasts for real GDP\ngrowth—well, not surprisingly, the dispersion for inflation forecasts is also unusually\nlarge at the present time, perhaps reflecting these divergent possibilities.\n16\n\nEven if the direct influences of commodity prices on inflation eventually\ndissipate, they could still cause trouble. Some argue that before this happens, higher\ninflation could become built into inflation expectations and become self-perpetuating. In\nother words, some fear that the specter of stagflation may rear its ugly head as it did in\nthe 1970s and early 1980s. Stagflation is thought to arise from a cycle of wage and price\nincreases—a wage-price spiral—initiated by a shock such as rising commodity prices—\nand perpetuated by poor monetary policy credibility and unanchored inflation\nexpectations. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the wage-price spiral was spun from the\npass-through of rising food and energy prices to inflation, which was in turn passed along\nto wages and, then again, through to final goods prices. Fueling the movement were\nexpectations that monetary policy would allow inflation to continue to rise for the\nforeseeable future.\nI see little reason to believe that we have entered, or are about to enter, such a\nperiod of stagflation. For one thing, although current data on growth and inflation have\ndeparted from desirable levels, matters looked far worse 30 years ago than they do now.\nFor another, there is no evidence that wages have started to spiral up, as broad\nmeasures of compensation have expanded quite moderately over the past year.\nMoreover, productivity growth has been fairly robust, and, after incorporating its effects,\nunit labor costs were up by only ¼ of 1 percent over the past year. In addition, the slack\nin labor and product markets stemming from the weakening in economic activity that\nseems likely should put somewhat greater downward pressure on inflation going forward.\nTherefore, my forecast of the most likely outcome over the next couple of years is that\ntotal and core inflation will moderate from present levels.\n17\n\nThe Federal Reserve cannot, however, be complacent about inflation. Some\nsurvey measures of long-run inflation expectations have inched up, and measures of\ninflation compensation derived from the differential between nominal and real Treasury\nyields are slightly higher, too. While none of these measures are perfect indicators of\ninflation expectations, recent movements highlight the risk that our attempts to deal with\nproblems in the real economy could lead to higher inflation expectations and an erosion\nof our credibility.\nPolicy\nLet me now turn to monetary policy. As I’ve just indicated, core inflation\nremains on the high side of where I would like it to be. At the same time, activity is weak\nacross most sectors of the economy, as the housing downturn, the escalation of\ncommodity prices, and the ongoing financial shock are weighing on consumption\nspending, business capital investment, and employment.\nThe FOMC has responded to these conditions by easing monetary policy\nsubstantially since September, cutting the federal funds rate by 3¼ percentage points to 2\npercent. With core consumer inflation running at about the same rate, the real funds rate\nnow stands at an accommodative level of around zero. These cuts in the target rate, along\nwith the actions to foster greater liquidity in financial markets, have mitigated the worst\neffects of the credit crunch. But they have not resolved it. Indeed, my sense is that the\nprocess of resolution will unfold only gradually.\nUnder these circumstances, I consider the current level of monetary\naccommodation to be appropriate. That, together with the fiscal package, should be\nsufficient to promote a step up to moderate economic growth later this year. Likewise, I\n18\n\nwould expect that inflation will moderate in coming quarters, as more slack in labor and\nproduct markets emerges and as commodity prices level off. Of course, we will continue\nto monitor developments and act as needed to fulfill our mandate for sustainable\neconomic growth and price stability.\nReferences\nAdrian, Tobias, and Hyun Song Shin. 2008. “Liquidity, Monetary Policy, and Financial Cycles.” Current\nIssues in Economics and Finance 14(1) (January/February), Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\nhttp://www.ny.frb.org/research/current_issues/ci14-1.html\nDemyanyk, Yuliya, and Otto van Hemert. 2008. “Understanding the Subprime Mortgage Crisis.”\nManuscript, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (February 4).\nhttp://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1020396\nDoms, Mark, Frederick Furlong, and John Krainer. 2007a. “Subprime Mortgage Delinquency Rates.”\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Working Paper 2007-33.\nhttp://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/papers/2007/wp07-33bk.pdf\nDoms, Mark, Frederick Furlong, and John Krainer. 2007b. “House Prices and Subprime Mortgage\nDelinquencies.” FRBSF Economic Letter 2007-14 (June 8).\nhttp://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2007/el2007-14.html\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. 2008. 2007 Annual Report.\nGerardi, Kristopher, Adam Hale Shapiro, and Paul S.

    "text": "Presentation to the Phoenix Chapter of Lambda Alpha International\nPhoenix, AZ\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on November 10, 2009, 8:05 AM Mountain Standard Time, 10:05 AM Eastern\nThe Outlook for the Economy and Real Estate1\nF\nThank you very much Sheila. It’s a great pleasure to see you again and to join all of you\nthis morning. I want to express my appreciation to Sheila for her excellent service as a member\nand as deputy chair of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank’s board of directors from 1999 to\n2004. I am very pleased to have the chance to speak to a group of professionals dedicated to\nadvancing the understanding of land economics. As you know, problems in real estate were\ncentral to the financial crisis and ongoing developments in this sector bear importantly on the\neconomy’s prospects for recovery. So my comments will focus on the economic outlook and I\nwill emphasize the role of real estate in shaping it.\nThroughout my remarks, I will compare the situation in the nation as a whole with that\nhere in Phoenix. I’m always struck when I visit Phoenix by the beauty of your natural setting\nand the great vitality of the city that has grown in this magnificent place. Phoenix demonstrates\na spirit of entrepreneurship, a sense of optimism about the future, and an eagerness to build\nsomething new. But, as the housing market collapsed and the nation fell into financial crisis and\nrecession, your desert metropolis was set back on its heels. Just as you grew faster than the\nnation as a whole during the boom years in the middle of the decade, so did you fall harder when\nthe bust came. I can only imagine what it’s like for those who’ve been blessed with one of the\n1 I would like to thank Fred Furlong, John Judd, David Wright, and Sam Zuckerman for assistance in\npreparing these remarks.\n1\n\nnation’s most vibrant economies to suffer a setback of this magnitude. I’m pleased to say that I\nthink you will find much in my message this morning that is encouraging.\nThis is the first talk I’ve given since the economy has officially been reported to be\ngrowing again. The economy’s return to growth after a year and a half of recession marks a\nmajor turn and it looks like more than a flash in the pan. It seems to me that the economy has\nentered a sustained period of expansion. We’ve seen meaningful upturns in areas as diverse as\nhousing, consumer spending, industrial production, and foreign trade. And, a number of factors\nbode well for the future, including a better functioning financial system, low mortgage interest\nrates, a resurgent stock market, a stabilization of house prices, and stronger growth abroad.\nAll the same, I am not going to paint an entirely rosy picture for you. The strength and\ndurability of the expansion is in question. Some of the rebound is due to temporary government\nprograms and a swing in inventory investment that will not provide an ongoing source of growth.\nFinancial conditions have improved markedly in some respects, but many financial institutions\nare still hobbled with bad loans. The outlook for consumer spending is in doubt because\nhouseholds remain burdened with debt, and they have taken enormous hits to their wealth from\ndeclines in house and stock prices in recent years. And it’s particularly sobering that labor\nmarkets continue to deteriorate badly, leaving many millions of our fellow Americans unable to\nfind jobs. Just last week, we found out that the unemployment rate passed 10 percent in October.\nThe 10.2 percent jobless rate is the highest since 1983. Today I will consider this mixed picture\nin some detail and focus on two subjects of professional interest to many of you—the residential\nand commercial real estate markets. I want to stress that my comments are my own and do not\nnecessarily reflect the views of my Federal Reserve colleagues.\n2\n\nAs we look at the national economy, it’s important to keep things in perspective. It’s not\nfun to ponder a subdued recovery. But a year ago, after the near collapse of the global financial\nsystem, there was a real possibility of an outright depression. Fortunately, we avoided that. But\nwhat we did suffer through was bad enough—the worst downturn since the Great Depression of\nthe 1930s. The recession began at the end of 2007. Economic output has dropped by just over\n3½ percent. Over seven million jobs have been lost in the nonfarm sector of the economy. And\nthe unemployment rate has soared by over five percentage points. Few, if any, parts of the\neconomy were unscathed. The labor market was devastated, and housing, consumer spending,\nbusiness investment, exports, and imports all fell off the table.\nPhoenix was particularly hard-hit. In May 2007, the area unemployment rate was an\nextraordinarily low 2.9 percent. By September 2009, the rate had roughly tripled to 8.5 percent.\nThat’s lower than the national rate, but it’s a huge 5.6 percentage point swing. Construction\nrepresented a higher-than-average share of the Arizona economy, and the drag from real estate\nover the past two years has been especially severe in the state.\nAgainst this backdrop, the nation’s third-quarter return to growth was a great relief. Real\ngross domestic product—which is the economy’s total output of goods and services—increased\nat a solid annual rate of 3½ percent. The recession hasn’t officially been declared over, but a\nwide array of data suggests that the corner has been turned. In the third quarter, residential\ninvestment—which was at the center of the downturn—rose at nearly a 25 percent annual rate,\nalbeit from a very low level. Home sales, prices, and housing starts are once again climbing.\nMeanwhile, manufacturing is also beginning to show signs of strength. This was helped by a\nrebound in motor vehicle production, boosted by the government’s temporary cash-for-clunkers\n3\n\nprogram. Our exports surged as growth abroad picked up. And, importantly, consumer spending\nfinally is growing.\nTo me, the explanation for this turnaround is clear: Massive and concerted responses by\ngovernments and central banks around the world rescued the financial system, brought down\ninterest rates, provided emergency support, and broke the economy’s downward spiral. On the\nmonetary policy side, the Fed has pushed its traditional interest rate lever—the federal funds\nrate—close to zero. And, in order to provide additional stimulus, we put in place an array of\nunconventional programs to spur the flow of credit to households and businesses. These\nmeasures provided funding to banks and restored liquidity to a range of markets. We’ve\nincreased the flow of credit for securities backed by small business loans, consumer loans, and\nother assets. Our large-scale purchases of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt and mortgage-\nbacked securities (MBS) helped lower mortgage rates and bolstered the housing market. We’ve\nalso bought longer-term U.S. Treasury debt to help bring private borrowing rates down.\nThese initiatives appear to have eased financial conditions. Clearly, the financial system\nis not yet back to normal, but it has bounced back notably. The stock market has soared since its\nlow in the winter. That rally has helped households recover some of their lost wealth and\nprovided a much-needed psychological boost. Investors perceive that economic risks are not as\ndire as they once seemed to be. Interest rates on corporate bonds—especially for less-than-prime\nfirms—have dropped sharply and issuance has been brisk. And the markets that financial\ninstitutions and corporations rely on for short-term funding are functioning reasonably well\nagain, due in part to Fed intervention.\n4\n\nFederal government policies also have contributed, including the fiscal stimulus program\npassed by Congress in February. Tax cuts have raised disposable income and government\nspending is directly adding to payrolls. Much of the stimulus money authorized by Congress\nremains to be spent and will spur growth in coming quarters. Other government initiatives\ncontributed to the third-quarter expansion as well, including the cash-for-clunkers program and\nthe $8,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers.\nThe normal dynamics of the business cycle have also turned more favorable. Demand for\nhouses, durable goods such as autos, and business equipment is beginning to revive as\nhouseholds and businesses replace or upgrade needed equipment and structures. A particularly\nhopeful sign is that inventories of unsold goods, which have been shrinking rapidly, now seem to\nbe in better alignment with sales. Manufacturers had slashed production dramatically in the face\nof slumping sales. Recent data suggest that this correction may be near an end, setting the stage\nfor more production.\nThe big issue is how strong the upturn will be. With such enormous reservoirs of slack in\nthe form of high unemployment and idle productive capacity, we need a strong rebound to put\nunemployed people back to work and get underutilized factories, offices, and stores humming\nagain. Unfortunately, my own forecast envisions a less-than-robust recovery for several reasons.\nAs the impetus from government programs and inventories diminishes in the quarters ahead,\nprivate final demand will have to fill the breach. The danger is that demand may grow at too\nanemic a pace to support vigorous expansion.\nFirst, it may take quite a while for financial institutions to heal to the point that normal\ncredit flows are restored. The credit crunch hasn’t entirely gone away. In the face of massive\n5\n\nloan losses, banks have clamped down on underwriting and credit terms for both businesses and\nconsumers. Smaller businesses without direct access to capital markets are particularly feeling\nthe pinch. Lenders have had to run hard just to stay in place: Rising unemployment, business\nfailures, and delinquencies in real estate markets have fed additional credit losses and made it\nmore difficult for financial institutions to get their balance sheets in good order.\nSecond, households have been pummeled and prospects for consumer spending are\ncloudy. Consumers have surprised us in the past with their free-spending ways and it’s not out\nof the question that they will do so again. But I wouldn’t count on them leading a strong\nrecovery. They face high and rising unemployment, stagnant wages, and heavy debt burdens.\nTheir nest eggs have shrunk dramatically as house and stock prices have fallen, and their access\nto credit has been squeezed.\nIt may be that we are witnessing the start of a new era for consumers following the harsh\nfinancial blows they have endured.2 We often hear the word “deleveraging” used to describe the\nF F\npush by financial institutions to scale back debt and build equity. Households too have now\nbegun to pay down debt and rebuild their savings. This phenomenon can be seen not only in the\nUnited States, but in most countries that experienced similar housing booms. The United States\nwas hardly the only country where households borrowed heavily just before a severe housing\nbust set in. And those countries with greater increases in debt relative to income before the crisis\nexperienced greater declines in consumption spending once the crisis began.\nIn the United States, the personal saving rate, which had fallen to an incredibly low 1\npercent in early 2008, has averaged 4 percent so far this year and may well rise higher. In the\n2 See Glick and Lansing (2009).\n6\n\ncurrent environment, such belt-tightening makes great sense from the standpoint of individual\nhouseholds. In fact, some households may have no other option because their access to credit\nhas been crimped. Over the long run, higher saving is surely a good thing for our economy\nbecause it provides capital that can be devoted to modern infrastructure, technology, and other\nproductive investments that enhance our standard of living. All the same, the transition to a\nhigher saving plane could be painful if it reduces the growth rate of consumer spending for an\nextended period.\nWeakness in the labor market is another factor that may keep the recovery sluggish for\nquite some time. Payroll employment has been plummeting for more than a year and a half, and,\neven though the pace of the decline has slowed, unemployment now stands at its highest level\nsince 1983. In addition, many workers have seen their hours cut or are experiencing involuntary\nfurloughs. To bolster earnings in the face of weak revenue growth, employers have been\naggressive in cutting labor costs and jobs, and my business contacts say they will be reluctant to\nhire again until they see clear evidence of a sustained recovery. Weak demand for workers is\nalso putting a lid on paychecks. Wages are barely rising. A well-known measure of overall\nemployment costs rose by only 1¼ percent over the past year, the smallest increase in the history\nof the series. High unemployment, weak job growth, and paltry wage increases are a recipe for\nsluggish consumer spending growth and a tepid recovery.\nThe U.S. experienced so-called jobless recoveries following the previous two recessions\nin 1991 and 2001, when job creation remained weak for several years following the business\ncycle trough. In both cases, output growth was less robust than in the typical recovery and,\nunfortunately, things seem to be shaping up similarly this time around.\n7\n\nNow I’d like to take a close look at real estate markets, both residential and commercial.\nYou may be getting weary of my “on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand” message, but I’m afraid I\nhave more of that to offer when it comes to housing. To put it bluntly, the outlook for the\nresidential market is uncertain. And uncertain is much better than the prospects for commercial\nreal estate, which clearly are weak.\nLet me begin with housing. We have gone through many boom-and-bust cycles, but\nnone in the past half century have had such far-reaching effects as the wild ride of residential real\nestate during this decade. House prices soared from 2002 through 2005, moving dramatically\nout of line with fundamentals. By one measure, house prices on average peaked more than 50\npercent above the level that could be supported by underlying rental values. Since the market\ntop three years ago, the nation has experienced roughly a 30 percent collapse in average house\nprices, depending on the index used. That’s a terrible plunge, but there’s some good news in it\nfor the future: Prices are approaching a range where valuations are more in line with\nfundamentals. Such an adjustment is essential for a sustained revival of housing activity.\nIndeed, there are indications that the sickening market plunge has ended, with prices\nbeginning to edge up. At the same time, home sale volumes are advancing briskly. The supply\nof new houses on the market has been brought down from over 12 months to about 7½ months.\nThat’s still well above the four-month supply that was typical in the period right before the bust,\nbut the adjustment seems to have been enough to kick some life back into construction. In the\nthird quarter, real residential investment surged, though from an admittedly low level. For the\nfirst time in more than three years, housing construction actually added to GDP growth.\n8\n\nWhat I’ve said about the national housing market can be seen in even sharper relief here\nin Arizona, and especially in the Phoenix area. The metropolitan area’s residential boom-and-\nbust cycle was considerably more pronounced than that of the nation as a whole. Gains in house\nprices were simply spectacular. Fast population and job growth following the 2001 recession\nexplains part of the story. However, the truly exceptional price jumps in 2004 and 2005, just\nbefore the collapse, look to be outsized even given the strong demographic and labor trends.\nSubprime loans represented an especially high proportion of mortgage lending in the region. Not\nsurprisingly, the house price collapse in this area has been especially severe. Price declines are\nas high as 50 percent or more, about 1½ times that of the nation, bringing values back to 2001\nlevels.\nFortunately, things are beginning to look up in Arizona as they are for the nation.\nExisting home sales are up sharply in recent months, although a large share of those are\nforeclosed properties. In the Phoenix area, home prices are now above their lows. A widely\nwatched forecasting survey predicts that 2009 will be the trough for housing permits in Phoenix\nand that 2010 will see significant increases.3\nF\nStill, the Phoenix housing market is nowhere near a return to health. In the face of high\nand rising unemployment, mortgage delinquency and foreclosure rates are still increasing in the\narea. The share of mortgage loans in foreclosure or 60 days or more past due is nearly three\ntimes the national median. And this is by no means largely a subprime problem. Prime\nborrowers now account for the lion’s share of new foreclosures.\n3 Blue Chip Economic Forecast Phoenix, Arizona State University, Third Quarter 2009.\nhttp://wpcarey.asu.edu/bluechip/phoenix/index.cfm\n9\n\nMeanwhile, developers and their creditors have been caught with excess raw land, lots\nthat are partially completed, or completed but still vacant. Values for finished but vacant lots\nacross the country are reported to be off about 50 percent from their peak, with some hard-hit\nregions in the West down even more. Over the past year and a half, developers and their bankers\nhave been working through this inventory and recognizing the associated losses. As write-offs\non these loans flow through community and regional banks, we can expect more failures.\nTurning back to the national picture, the bottom line is that the outlook for housing has\nturned up in response to favorable mortgage rates, lower house prices, and a lower overhang of\nunsold houses. And growth in this sector should contribute to the overall economic recovery.\nThese developments represent real gains, but it’s important not to get carried away. Some of the\nadvance reflects temporary government support in the form of tax credits for first-time home\nbuyers, and the impact of loan modification programs and foreclosure moratoriums that reduced\nthe pace of distressed sales. Moreover, foreclosure notices surged earlier this year and distressed\nproperty sales may rise once again in the months ahead. If so, we could see renewed pressure on\nhouse prices. Of course, continuing high unemployment will also fuel additional foreclosures.\nAnd the supply of credit for nonconforming mortgages remains extremely tight. Financial\ninstitutions are reluctant to place them on their books when they are trying to reduce leverage\nand we have yet to see any revival of the market for private mortgage-backed securities.\nWhen we turn to commercial real estate, the prospects are worrisome. Commercial\nproperty didn’t turn down until well after housing did. The sector’s problems appear to stem in\nlarge part from the effects of the recession and the credit crunch, rather than the type of building\nboom and lax underwriting standards that tripped up housing. Still, there are some parallels\nbetween the two sectors. As in the residential market, commercial real estate values posted\n10\n\nenormous price gains, with office values roughly doubling from the end of the 2001 recession to\nthe peak. Since then, values have plunged an estimated 35 to 40 percent and vacancy rates are\nrising for office, retail, warehouse, and other income-producing properties. In Arizona, office\nvacancy rates started moving up in the second part of 2006 as job growth decelerated abruptly\nfrom an exceptionally fast pace. Vacancies in Phoenix are near 25 percent, about a 13\npercentage point rise from the recent low.\nAs I indicated, credit market conditions are weighing heavily on this sector. Risk\npremiums on commercial real estate financing remain elevated, although they’re down a bit from\nthe peak of the financial crisis. Average commercial real estate capitalization rates have seen\nrisk spreads more than double over the past two years to more than 4 percentage points over 10-\nyear Treasury securities. The market for commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS)\nremains deeply distressed and issuance is meager despite support from the Fed’s Term Asset-\nBacked Securities Loan Facility (TALF) and the Treasury’s Public-Private Investment Program\n(PPIP). Banks and thrifts, which account for more than half of commercial real estate financing,\nhave significantly raised rates and tightened credit terms. That, combined with higher investor\ndemands for returns and weakening operating income, points to further downward pressure on\nproperty values.\nCommercial real estate borrowers are increasingly hard-pressed to stay current on their\nloans. CMBS delinquency rates rose from about half a percent in August 2008 to over 3 percent\nthis July. Weakening loan quality is particularly damaging in Arizona where commercial real\nestate accounts for a much larger share of the average bank loan portfolio than in the nation. A\nlarge volume of commercial real estate loans and securities are coming up for renewal over the\nnext several years. This will prompt lenders and investors to review terms for continued\n11\n\nextension of credit. In many instances, banks are asking borrowers to either repay loans, provide\nmore equity, or agree to modified terms and conditions. These adverse trends recently prompted\nfederal regulators to issue guidance on commercial real estate to banks and thrifts, with a focus\non sound practices for loan workouts.\nNationwide, the commercial real estate downturn has been a drag on economic growth,\nsubtracting about 1 percent at an annual rate over the first three quarters of this year, compared\nwith a roughly neutral effect in 2008. All indications are that commercial real estate will\ncontinue weighing down the recovery going forward.\nWhen the weakness of the commercial property market is combined with the muted\noutlook for housing and consumer spending, you can see why I believe that the overall economic\nrecovery is likely to be gradual and remain vulnerable to shocks. It’s popular to pick a letter of\nthe alphabet to describe the likely course of the economy. The letter I would choose doesn’t\nexist in our alphabet, but if I were to describe it, it would look something like an “L” with a\ngradual upward tilt of the base. With such a slow rebound, unemployment could well stay high\nfor several years to come. In other words, our recovery is likely to feel like something well short\nof good times.\nThis brings me to inflation, a topic that has been hotly debated.4 Some people worry\nF F\nabout the long-term inflationary implications of sustained federal budget deficits. Others fear\nthat economic slack and downward wage pressure are pushing inflation below rates that are\nconsistent with price stability. I am in the second camp. Persistent large budget deficits may be\nharmful once the economy recovers because they are apt to boost interest rates and absorb\n4 See Leduc, Rudebusch and Weidner (2009).\n12\n\nprivate savings that would otherwise finance productive investments. But experience teaches us\nthat budget deficits do not cause inflation in advanced economies with independent central banks\nthat pursue appropriate monetary policies.5 As for the Fed, you can be 100 percent certain that\nF F\nprice stability will remain our objective, regardless of the stance of fiscal policy.\nI believe that the more significant threat to price stability over the next several years\nstems from enormous slack in the economy that is pushing inflation lower. Today, inflation is\nalready very low. Over the past 12 months, consumer prices as measured by the personal\nconsumption price index actually fell by one-half percent. After removing the effects of volatile\nfood and energy prices, core prices rose by 1¼ percent. That’s below the 2 percent rate that I\nand most of my fellow Fed policymakers on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nconsider an appropriate long-term price stability objective. The public’s inflation expectations,\nwhich can independently influence inflation, remain well anchored, which is appropriate given\nthe Fed’s record and its commitment to price stability. And with slack likely to persist for years\nand wages barely rising, it seems probable that core inflation will move even lower over the next\nfew years.\nThis landscape presents clear challenges for monetary policy. We face an economy with\nsubstantial slack, prospects for only moderate growth, and low and declining inflation. With the\nfederal funds rate already at zero for all practical purposes, the Fed’s traditional policy tool is as\naccommodative as it can be. To provide more stimulus, the Fed has used unconventional policy\ntools, including emergency lending programs to promote liquidity and push longer-term interest\nrates lower. However, many of these programs are winding down or nearing completion. That\n5 See Fischer, Sahay, and Vegh (2002) and Catao and Terrones (2005) for analysis of the relationship between\ndeficits and inflation in the post-World War II period.\n13\n\nis why the FOMC stated that “economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization,\nsubdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally\nlow levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period” following our meeting last week.\nAt some point, of course, we will have to tighten policy—and we certainly have the\nmeans and the will to do so. We are—and always will be—steadfast in our determination to\nachieve both of our statutory goals of full employment and price stability. Until that time comes\nthough, we need to provide the monetary accommodation necessary to spur job creation and\nprevent inflation from falling any further below rates that are consistent with price stability.\nThank you very much.\nReferences\nCatao, Luis A.V., and Marco E.

    "text": "Presentation to the 2009 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum conducted by the University of Chicago\nBooth School of Business and Brandeis International Business School\nNew York, New York\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on February 27, 2009, 10:45 AM Eastern time, 7:45 AM Pacific\nDiscussion of “Oil and the Macroeconomy: Lessons for Monetary Policy”1\nIt’s a pleasure to discuss this thoughtful and comprehensive report on the macroeconomic\nimplications of oil price movements.2 Even though we are no longer faced with sky-high oil\nprices, the issues discussed here remain important and policy relevant. It is hard to believe that\noil prices will not go up again sometime in the future, so it is vital that we learn from the last\nepisode, both about how the economy is likely to be affected and how monetary policy should\nrespond.\nPerhaps not surprisingly, most of my discussion relates to the latter topic, namely the\nFed’s policy response to the swings in oil prices over the last seven years. But I would like to\nstart by commenting on the paper’s discussion of the relationship between the market price of oil\nand the value of oil in the ground. Thinking of this relationship in terms of Tobin’s q is an\nelegant and insightful contribution. As the authors point out, oil in the ground is like any other\nirreproducible asset, which should be described by Hotelling’s theory that the price of such an\nasset minus marginal cost increases at a rate equal to the prevailing interest rate. But oil above\nthe ground has distinct characteristics. And a number of factors can cause its price to depart—\nfor some time—from the value implied by Hotelling’s model. Thus, q—the ratio of the market\n1 I would like to thank Bharat Trehan, John Fernald, John Judd, John Williams, and Sam Zuckerman for\nassistance in preparing these remarks.\n2 Harris, Kasman, Shapiro, and West (2009)\n\nprice of oil to its value in the ground—can and does deviate from unity. The authors provide an\nimportant and informative example of such a departure, which uses data on mergers and\nacquisitions to calculate the value of the oil in the ground and compare it to the market price of\noil over the last few years. This exercise, together with one based on the stock prices of large oil\ncompanies, suggests that the market price of oil was temporarily high in 2007, and that the jump\nin the first part of 2008 represented a further departure from the long-term value. I will return to\nthis topic later.\nLet me now turn to the paper’s discussion of oil prices and monetary policy, a topic that\nhas sparked much debate among academic economists and policymakers during my two stints as\na Fed policymaker. The authors have accurately summarized the main issues involved in the\ndebate that took place during 2002–2008, both inside and outside the Fed. As is well known, an\noil price shock typically poses a dilemma for policymakers: Higher oil prices depress output and\nraise inflation. While the reduction in output provides a reason for policy to ease, the uptick in\ninflation pushes policy in the opposite direction. It is rarely obvious which element deserves\ngreater weight in policy decisions, and that leads to debate about the appropriate response. The\noil shocks of the past several years were no exception.\nI agree with the authors’ assessment that the Fed focused primarily on core rather than\nheadline inflation to gauge the extent of underlying inflationary pressures during this period.\nThis strategy, as the authors note, can be justified on theoretical grounds. Since core inflation\nrose only slightly, the Fed’s main inflation gauge did not signal a need to tighten policy\ndramatically. But as energy costs soared, the economy did experience an uncomfortable increase\nin headline inflation. The authors argue that the Fed should have paid more attention to the\nacceleration in headline inflation and raised interest rates by more than it did from 2004 to 2006.\n2\n\nTheir argument is buttressed by two exercises, one of which examines some data on\nexpected inflation while the other is based on model simulations. I will comment on each of\nthese, in turn. Using a small vector autoregression model—where the price of oil is assumed to\nbe exogenous—the authors show that changes in the price of oil help predict (or, more\nspecifically, Granger cause) the Michigan survey’s measure of expected inflation and also one of\ntwo expectations measures based on Treasury yields. This result suggests to the authors that the\nFed may have lost, or been on the verge of losing, at least some of its inflation-fighting\ncredibility. Such a loss of credibility would obviously be problematic. For one thing, it would\nincrease the amount by which the Fed would have to increase rates to offset any given\ninflationary shock.3\nIt’s not clear to me, however, that the Fed’s credibility was actually under such serious\nthreat. Even taking the results at face value, the increase in expected inflation was small.\nFigure 5.3 in the paper reveals, in particular, that for three of their four measures, expected\ninflation in 2008 was only about one-tenth of a percentage point higher than what it would have\nbeen in the absence of any increase in the price of oil over this period.\nBut I think there are good reasons not to take these results at face value. Consider, first,\nthe authors’ choice of survey measures. They argue that an increase in readings from the\nMichigan survey—following years of stability—reflects increasing inflation expectations. But\nthey discount the stability of inflation expectations in the Survey of Professional Forecasters\n(SPF), arguing that it indicates “…forecast inertia rather than a super-credible central bank.” I\nfind the authors’ preference for consumer surveys over those of professional forecasters\nsurprising since it is usually argued that households pay less attention to the latest data than do\n3 See, for example, Orphanides and Williams (2004, 2007).\n3\n\nthe professionals who are paid to make these forecasts. Moreover, households probably update\ntheir forecasts of inflation less frequently than professionals. It’s also worth pointing out that the\nlack of responsiveness of professional forecasts to relative price shocks appears to be a recent\nphenomenon, likely due, in my view, to increased Fed credibility and not some newly acquired\ninertia on the part of the forecasters. Research by my staff shows that while the SPF forecasts\nwere sensitive to headline inflation data in the past, these forecasts have responded in recent\nyears to core rather than headline inflation data.4 This finding suggests that professional\nforecasters no longer expect relative price changes to have a persistent effect on inflation.\nI would also take issue with the authors’ assumption that oil prices are exogenous. For\none thing, this assumption is at odds with the paper’s extended discussion about how the price of\noil is determined by economic developments in the U.S. and other countries. Moreover, the\nassumption is probably not innocuous: previous research has shown that treating oil as\nendogenous in such models can greatly reduce the estimated effects of oil shocks.5\nLast, and certainly not least, I would question the authors’ conclusion that inflation\nexpectations have become unanchored based on their finding that oil prices help predict the\nMichigan survey measures of expected inflation. This finding does imply that a jump in the\nprice of oil causes expected inflation to increase for a time. But it does not prove that the\nincrease is permanent rather than transitory. A permanent response of expected inflation to a\nchange in oil prices requires either that the expectations process be nonstationary or that oil\nprices be expected to continue rising forever. In other words, the authors’ finding of a link\nbetween oil prices and survey measures of expected inflation is perfectly consistent with a\n4 Trehan (2009).\n5 See Trehan (1986) and Barsky and Kilian (2004) for discussions of this issue.\n4\n\ntemporary impact of oil price shocks on both inflation and inflation expectations. Importantly,\nthese are precisely the responses that are consistent with well-anchored expectations—except, of\ncourse, if consumers believe that the Fed would absorb the hit of an oil shock entirely in the form\nof reduced output.\nLet me turn now to the second exercise in the paper, which involves simulating a new\nKeynesian model to examine the effects of oil shocks. As the authors point out, their\nspecification reproduces a standard feature of such models, which is that it is better for monetary\npolicy to target core inflation than headline inflation. But the authors then proceed to conduct an\nunusual simulation. To mimic the pattern of oil price increases from 2002 to 2008, they subject\nthe model to a sequence of 26 quarterly shocks in which the average increase in the price of oil is\nabout 7½ percent. While they present results for several different parameter combinations, the\ntypical outcome entails a core inflation rate that is about 2 to 4 percentage points higher than the\nassumed inflation target of around 1¾ percent. The authors argue that such a sequence of oil\nprice and inflation increases could cause inflation expectations to become unanchored. The\nimplication is that the Fed should have tightened policy more than it did to keep expectations\nfrom being cast adrift.\nA key element of their simulation is the assumption of a long period of increasing oil\nprices. Was it reasonable to expect such an outcome on a priori grounds? We can use the\nauthors’ elegant framework to answer this question. The first factor that is relevant in\nforecasting oil prices in that framework is the price of oil in the ground, as determined by the\nHotelling model. However, the authors do not argue that this price changed substantially over\nthe last five years or so. The second relevant factor is the behavior of q. In the authors’\nframework, q should be expected to converge toward unity in the medium to long term. Thus,\n5\n\nthe theory of the oil market presented in the paper suggests that forecasters during the 2002–\n2008 period should have expected oil prices to gradually revert to more “normal” levels over\ntime, once q exceeded one. Of course, the model does not pin down precisely what might\nhappen to the market price of oil for the next four, six or even eight quarters. Oil prices are\nnotoriously hard to predict at these (and indeed at all) horizons, and there is plenty of room to\nargue about the role played by fundamentals, special factors, speculation, etc. But throughout\nmost of this period, futures prices were predicting, even as oil prices rose, that oil prices would\nnot rise further—and certainly not for six years running. And these were the most important\nreal-time indicators of market expectations available to the Fed. Of course, futures-market\nforecasts proved wrong, ex post. But it seems to me now, as it did at the time, that there were\nneither strong empirical nor theoretical reasons to forecast that oil prices would continue rising\nfor six years.\nSince the improbable did in fact come to pass and the Fed tightened less than the authors\nconsider optimal, it seems entirely appropriate to consider the costs of the Fed’s policy judgment.\nThe authors note that the onset of the recession makes it all but impossible to get an\nunambiguous answer, and I agree. But I still think we can form some judgments based on the\nbehavior of inflation during the more-than-five-year period, ending in mid-2008, during which\noil prices kept moving higher. In 2001—the year before oil prices began to rise—core PCE price\ninflation was 1.9 percent. It averaged 2.2 percent over 2005–2007 and registered 2.2 percent\nduring the first half of 2008. So, core inflation did rise somewhat. We can debate just how\nmuch of that increase should be attributed to oil shocks, rising capacity utilization levels, and the\nwearing-off of the unusual sequence of productivity shocks of the late 1990s, which had helped\nto push inflation to an unusually low level for a time. The important point, though, is that the\n6\n\nactual increase in core inflation fell far short of the increase predicted by the model simulations\npresented in the paper.\nDuring the period of rising oil prices and high headline inflation, policymakers paid\nclose attention to the behavior of wages for possible signs that higher inflationary expectations\nmight be spilling over into wage bargains. Reassuringly, there was little evidence of any\nincrease in the rate of wage growth, a linkage that I consider necessary for a sustained increase in\nthe inflation rate. For instance, after increasing at a 4.3 percent pace in 2001—the year before oil\nprices began their sustained increase—the Employment Cost Index rose by an average of a little over 3.2\npercent per year over 2005–2007 and at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the first half of 2008. Other\ncompensation measures also reveal relatively steady wage growth during this period.6 So, data\non wages, like those on core inflation, reveal little evidence of any impact resulting from the long\nsequence of large oil price shocks.\nThe authors attribute the lack of any sizable run-up in core inflation to other shocks that\nmay have hit the economy at the same time. But it is important to emphasize that a significant\nbody of recent research instead suggests that the measured effect of oil price shocks has\ndiminished over the last several decades. Over a decade ago, Hooker (1996) showed that the\neffect of oil price shocks had diminished since the early 1980s and subsequent research has\nverified this finding. In fact, this influential research has shifted the academic debate concerning\noil shocks, with some authors now questioning whether such shocks were ever actually as\nimportant as was believed in the 1970s (Barsky and Kilian, 2004, Bernanke, Gertler, Watson,\n6 Other wage and compensation measures reveal the same general behavior. Total compensation per hour in the\nnonfarm business sector rose by 4.1 percent in 2001, an average of 4 percent over 2005–2007, and by 2.4 percent at\nan annual rate in the first half of 2008. Average hourly earnings rose by 3.8 percent in 2001, an average of 3.6\npercent per year over 2005–2007, and at a 3.8 percent rate in the first half of 2008.\n7\n\n1997) and others investigating what structural changes in the economy may have diminished the\nimpact of such shocks (Blanchard and Gali, 2007).\nIt seems to me that a change in the conduct of monetary policy following the experience\nof the 1970s has probably caused inflation expectations to become better anchored, explaining\nwhy recent oil shocks have inflicted relatively little damage on the economy. This hypothesis\ncould at least partly explain why the huge run-up in energy prices through the middle of last year\nwas not accompanied by rising wage demands. That in turn enabled the Fed to follow an easier\nmonetary policy that gave greater weight to the output effect of rising oil prices than would have\notherwise been possible.\nSince mid-2008, oil prices have, of course, plummeted. But the extraordinary weakness\nin the economy means that the usual trade-offs associated with such supply shocks are absent\nright now. Any boost to spending from falling oil prices will be more than welcome in the\ncurrent circumstances. And with inflation now below desirable levels, a decline in inflationary\nexpectations that could push core inflation down over time would be most unwelcome. I argued\nearlier that the Fed’s inflation credibility helped over a number of years to keep inflationary\nexpectations anchored in the face of rising oil prices and high headline inflation. My hope is that\ninflationary expectations will remain similarly well-anchored now, serving to stabilize core\ninflation. The FOMC’s recently released longer-run inflation projections should be useful in this\nregard, helping to reinforce inflation expectations of around 2 percent.\nTo conclude, let me emphasize that I enjoyed reading the paper and found the discussion\nof recent developments quite informative. But, the arguments in this paper did not persuade me\nto change my opinion of recent Fed policy. As I noted, during the period of rising oil prices,\nthere was little evidence that policy was inappropriate: labor compensation growth remained well\n8\n\ncontained and inflation persistence appeared to be low, most likely because of increased Fed\ncredibility. The Fed must always be vigilant in guarding its inflation credibility. But I did not\nthink then, and I do not think now with the benefit of hindsight, that expectations became or\nwere close to becoming unanchored at any point. Nor do I think that the Fed should have taken\nout substantial insurance against the possible consequences of a highly unlikely sequence of\nshocks, especially when a growing body of research suggested that the impact of oil shocks had\ndeclined substantially since the 1970s.\nReferences\nBarsky, Robert B., and Lutz Kilian. 2004. “Oil and the Macroeconomy Since the 1970s.” Journal of\nEconomic Perspectives 18(4), pp. 115–134.\nBernanke, Ben S., Mark Gertler, and Mark Watson. 1997. “Systematic Monetary Policy and the Effects of\nOil Price Shocks.” Working Paper 97-25, C.V.

Yellen,∗ President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery January 20, 2005, 12:45 PM Pacific Time, 3:45 Eastern\nThe U.S. Economic Outlook\nThanks for that very kind introduction. It’s a pleasure to meet with you today. As\nLeslie said, I served as a monetary policymaker once before--back in the mid-1990s,\nwhen I was a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in\nWashington, D.C. Since then, of course, there have been some important developments\nand advances in the conduct of monetary policy.\nOne that began while I was at the Board involved communication. The Federal\nOpen Market Committee took some significant steps toward improving the way it\nconveys its messages to the markets, the press, and the public. An important impetus was\nthe conviction that the more people understand about the goals of monetary policy and\nhow the Committee is trying to achieve them, the more effective policy can be. The\nreason is that it’s not just today’s level of the federal funds rate that matters for the way\npeople make decisions in the marketplace. What also matters are people’s expectations\nabout future policy actions. That’s because those expectations have a strong influence on\ntoday’s longer-term interest rates and financial conditions more generally and therefore\non the economic decisions and plans of households and businesses.\n∗ The opinions expressed in this speech are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco or of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n1\n\nIn the years since I was at the Board, the Committee has worked to improve their\ncommunications to help shape those expectations. One way, of course, is through\nspeeches like this one. But an important institutional step was developing the press\nstatement that is now released at the close of each policy meeting of the FOMC. It has\nevolved to explain the Committee’s outlook for the economy and inflation and how it\nperceives the balance of risks to those outlooks.\nThe Committee took another significant step in its communications efforts at its\nlast meeting on December 14. It voted to speed up the release of the minutes of the\nmeetings. Now, the minutes come out three weeks after each meeting and therefore\nbefore the next meeting, rather than a day or two after it. This, of course, makes the\ninformation in the minutes more useful in assessing the Fed’s next policy decision. The\nnew schedule was announced in the same press statement that announced the quarter\npoint increase in the fed funds rate. One reporter--who’s well known for his coverage of\nthe Fed--said this: “The most important step Federal Reserve officials took was not\nraising their target for the overnight lending rate by a quarter point. It was the decision to\nrelease the minutes of each FOMC meeting three weeks after it occurs.” For those of you\nwho have never read the minutes, they summarize the discussions among all nineteen\npeople at the meeting—so naturally you get to see the variety of viewpoints the\nparticipants hold.\nAs many of you know, when the minutes were released on January 4, there was a\nlot of focus on the paragraphs that described some risks that could lead to higher\ninflation. But if you read through the document, you’ll find that it also contains a\ndiscussion of factors that may put downward pressure on inflation. Indeed, at several\n2\n\npoints, the minutes say that the Committee felt that inflation and longer-term inflation\nexpectations remain well-contained and the risks to price stability are roughly equal. In\nfact, those are the very words the Committee members agreed to use in the official press\nstatement.\nMy own view is consistent with that statement--I do think the inflation risks are\nfairly well balanced. I agree that there are forces that could cause inflation to rise. But\nsince the reaction to the minutes focused so much on those forces, I thought I’d use this\noccasion as a chance to give “equal time” to the other side--the counterbalancing forces\nthat can hold inflation in check. As always, these remarks reflect my own views and not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve.\nBefore discussing inflation, however, let me start with a brief description of my\nviews on the real side of the economy--that is, on output and employment.\nThe real side of the economy\nThe good news is that we’ve now seen enough positive signs in the economy to\nhave some confidence that it is on course for self-sustaining growth. Over the past year\nand a half, output growth averaged four and a half percent, solidly above trend, which, by\nmost estimates, is around three and a quarter to three and a half percent. In particular,\nrecent data show strength in manufacturing output and consumer spending.\nIn terms of the labor market, the data have finally become more consistently\npositive, especially since mid-year. Taking the average over all of 2004, the economy\ngained about 185,000 jobs per month. Though this is not a fantastic performance, it is\nsufficient to suggest that the labor market finally is firming up enough to gradually\n3\n\neliminate the resource slack that remains. And that’s certainly something many people\nhave been eagerly waiting for.\nAlthough this overall performance is pretty good, I think it’s important to qualify\nit a bit by noting what the context is: In order to get this performance, monetary policy\nhas had to be extremely accommodative--and for a very long time. Indeed, the economy\nhas been getting a push not only from substantial monetary stimulus, but also from\nsubstantial fiscal stimulus, including several tax cut packages and increased spending on\ndefense and homeland security.\nSo, one might ask, given all this stimulus, why isn’t the economy doing even\nbetter? What’s holding it back? I can think of a few factors, some of which will come up\nagain when I discuss inflation.\nOne is the oil price shock. Although consumer spending has been remarkably\nresilient in the face of this shock, the evidence does suggest that there was some negative\nimpact on spending over the past year.\nAnother factor involves the large and growing trade gap. By reducing the need\nfor domestic production of goods and services, the trade deficit subtracted more than half\na percentage point from real GDP growth over the past year. Whether the trade gap will\nnarrow depends—in part—on the strength of economic growth among our trading\npartners, because that affects demand for our exports. However, most of our major\ntrading partners have had only moderate growth recently. It is true that non-oil import\nprices have risen modestly over the past year, while the prices of U.S. exports have\ndeclined relative to foreign price levels. Such price shifts do tend to curb imports and\nboost exports over time. But they are hardly enough to stem the tide of rising imports\n4\n\ninto this country or to stimulate our own exports very much in the face of only moderate\ngrowth abroad.\nGoing forward, a couple of factors that could take some steam out of the\nexpansion are related to fiscal policy and business investment. While fiscal policy\nstimulated the economy over the last couple of years, with tax cuts and spending\nincreases, this year most estimates indicate that it is likely to become roughly neutral, if\ncurrent plans remain in place. In terms of business investment, the good news is that it\nhas finally rebounded, reaching a double-digit rate for the past three quarters. But there\nare hints of a possibility that business investment in high-tech could slow down. At this\npoint, the data are too recent to be conclusive, but they are suggestive. In the third\nquarter, the growth rate in businesses’ real investment in high-tech fell to just over eight\npercent—far below what it was over the prior four quarters. And since the middle of last\nyear, growth in high-tech manufacturing production slowed noticeably. Another hint\ncomes from the recent slide in the stock prices of some major high-tech firms; insofar as\nstock prices are good predictors, this suggests a more subdued outlook. Moreover, during\nthe last year, quality-adjusted computer prices haven’t been falling as fast, and that may\nsignal some slowing of technological innovation in this sector. Finally, there is some\nindustry opinion that the pace of software development is beginning to slow.\nAlthough I’ve spent a fair bit of time discussing several current and potential\ndrags on the economy, I want to emphasize that, overall, my view is positive. I think the\ndata are pretty convincing that the economy is on course for sustainable growth, probably\nmodestly above trend, for this year.\n5\n\nBalanced risks to inflation\nNow let me turn to inflation, where we have two main measures of consumer\nprices to consider. One is the consumer price index, the CPI—in particular, the core CPI,\nwhich excludes volatile food and energy prices. Over the last twelve months, inflation in\nthis measure has come in at a relatively moderate two and a quarter percent. This is up\nnoticeably from 2003, in part reflecting some pass-through of higher oil prices into core\nprices as well as increases in both commodity and import prices. The other measure of\ncore consumer inflation, which is based on the personal consumption expenditures index,\ngives a somewhat more reassuring picture. Inflation according to the core PCE has been\nmore modest, averaging only one and a half percent over the past year and just one and a\nquarter percent over the past three months. So, overall, recent data show core consumer\ninflation behaving reasonably well.\nMy expectation is that inflation will remain well contained, assuming that the\neconomy grows at a pace which is modestly above trend. There are risks to this forecast\nbut, as I said, I consider them fairly well balanced, not asymmetric. To explain my view,\nI would like to rely on the so-called Phillips Curve framework, which is conventionally\nused by economists to forecast inflation. The framework suggests that five main factors\ninfluence inflation. These are (1) the extent of slack in the labor market, (2) the public’s\nexpectations of future inflation, (3) the extent to which businesses mark up their costs in\nsetting prices, (4) movements in important relative prices, especially the price of oil and\nthe foreign exchange value of the dollar, and (5) productivity growth.\nI’ll start with labor market slack, which matters for inflation to the extent that it\naffects the pace of compensation growth. The unemployment rate currently stands at\n6\n\njust under five and a half percent. Most economists would agree that some slack remains\nin labor markets which should be putting downward pressure on labor cost increases and\ninflation. With the unemployment rate likely to fall gradually toward full employment\nover the next couple of years, the extent of this downward pressure should diminish. By\nitself, that does suggest the potential for some slight upward drift of inflation.\nThere is considerable uncertainty and debate about how much slack remains and\nhow fast it’s likely to diminish. A key part of the debate centers on the recent fall in\nlabor force participation--that is, the fraction of the population that’s working or looking\nfor work. This decline in labor force participation started around the time the economy\nslowed at the beginning of the 2001 recession. The question is whether this is a cyclical\nphenomenon that will reverse as the current expansion picks up more steam, or whether\nit’s a new trend that’s independent of the business cycle. If it’s cyclical, and labor force\nparticipation does begin to rise, this will mean more downward pressure on inflation. If\nit’s not--that is, if participation does not rise or continues to fall--this will mean the\nremaining slack in the economy will diminish faster, creating upward pressure on\ninflation sooner. There are good arguments on both sides of this issue, and it’s too soon\nto tell from the data which one will prove to be more accurate. So, the bottom line is that\nthere is some uncertainty about the true extent of slack and its impact on the inflation\noutlook.\nThe second factor which affects inflation is inflationary expectations. We learned\nduring the 1970s that once people begin to expect higher inflation, those expectations\nmay affect wage bargaining. Expecting higher inflation, workers demand, and firms are\nmore likely to grant, correspondingly higher wage and salary increases. Once higher\n7\n\ninflationary expectations become embodied in wage and salary bargaining, inflation can\nstart spiraling upward. So, this possibility represents a risk for inflation.\nOne way to gauge whether inflationary expectations have risen is through\nfinancial market indicators, such as the spread between the yield on Treasury bonds and\non Treasury inflation-indexed securities. This spread is a measure of the inflation\ncompensation demanded by market participants. Recently there has been a noticeable\nincrease in the average compensation for inflation over the next five years. Looking\nfurther out, however, we see almost no change in the compensation for inflation from five\nto ten years into the future. Survey measures of long-term inflation expectations have\nalso been extremely stable. The stability of long-term inflation expectations presumably\nreflects the market’s view that the Fed will continue to demonstrate that it is willing to do\nwhat is necessary to ensure price stability in the U.S. economy.\nBoth slack and inflation expectations often work through changes in labor\ncompensation to influence price increases. It’s hard to find evidence suggesting upward\npressure through this channel. For example, over the past three years, the pattern of\ngrowth in total compensation in private industry, as measured by the employment cost\nindex, has been pretty steady--about three and three-quarters percent. Looking behind\nthese numbers, we find that they include both a deceleration in wages and salaries and\nunusually large increases in benefit costs. Looking ahead, recent surveys suggest that\ngrowth in health insurance costs is likely to moderate significantly this year. To some\nextent, such moderation could hold down overall compensation growth this year, since\nit’s doubtful that offsetting increases in wages and salaries would completely fill the gap\nthat quickly.\n8\n\nMoreover, there is another factor that could allow inflation to fall even if labor\ncompensation were to begin to accelerate. The extent to which businesses have marked\nup the prices of their products over the unit labor costs they face has been extraordinarily\nlarge for some time now. This large mark-up could return to more normal levels through\nfaster growth in labor compensation or falling inflation, or through some combination of\nthe two. Historical experience with this adjustment suggests that the restraint on inflation\ncould be quite significant even if compensation growth did begin to move upward. The\nhigh current markup thus represents the potential for downward pressure on inflation.\nA fourth set of factors influencing inflation includes the significant changes that\nhave occurred in the price of oil and in the dollar over the past year or so. Both higher\noil prices and the lower dollar would be expected to put moderate upward pressure on\ninflation, at least for a time. And, as I said, we’re probably seeing this already in the\nconsumer price index. The key question is whether this upward pressure on inflation will\npersist. The answer depends on at least two developments. One, obviously, is whether\noil prices keep rising and the dollar keeps falling. But predicting the direction of either\noil prices or the dollar is notoriously difficult, so this uncertainty in itself is a double-\nedged risk for inflation. The second development again is inflation expectations. So long\nas oil prices and the dollar remain at their present levels, their effects on inflation are\nlikely to be only temporary, implying that the size of the upward pressure should\ndiminish over time. It is only if the current inflationary effects of these movements\nbecome embedded in inflation expectations and wage bargaining that they are likely to\npersist. But, as I argued earlier, long-term inflation expectations remain stable and labor\ncompensation increases have been steady and moderate.\n9\n\nThe final factor I want to mention that impacts inflation is productivity growth.\nFor about ten years now, U.S. productivity growth has been very strong. It grew at\naround two and a half percent in the latter half of the 1990s and has increased even more\nrapidly—at an amazing four percent--so far in this decade. Of course, it’s not reasonable\nto expect the four percent pace to be maintained in the long run. A number of leading\nexperts estimate the trend rate at around two and a half percent, still a very high number\nthat would dramatically enhance living standards in this country over the years.\nHow does productivity growth affect inflation? With rapid productivity growth,\nfirms have the capacity to expand production to meet growing demand with lower unit\ncosts of production, and therefore they don’t need to raise prices as much to generate a\nprofit. Eventually, of course, unit costs are likely to rise as workers seek higher wages to\ncompensate them for their increased productivity. But during the adjustment period--\nwhich can last for a considerable period of time--there is downward pressure on inflation.\nBy the same token, slower growth in productivity could lead to upward pressure on\ninflation for a time.\nThe issue for inflation going forward is whether productivity growth will match\nthe trend rate of around two and a half percent that I mentioned before. If so, core\ninflation seems likely to remain stable, near its current moderate pace, assuming no new\ndevelopments in compensation or profit margins. I see the risks in this regard as fairly\nwell balanced. One argument on the side of slowing is related to stories we’ve heard\nabout the business caution that was an important feature of the last recession. It’s\nunderstandable that the investment bust in the last recession, the tragedy of 9/11, the wars\nin Afghanistan and Iraq, and the corporate governance scandals could have eroded\n10\n\nbusiness confidence. And that may have made firms reluctant to take on the long-run\ncommitment of adding workers. Some argue that this factor accounts for much of the\nproductivity growth we saw since the recession. In this view, when firms become more\nconfident about the future, they will hire more workers and productivity growth will\nslow. This argument would be more convincing if the data showed that firms are\nboosting their productivity by making their existing employees work longer hours. But\nthe admittedly limited data we have--which covers only production and nonsupervisory\nworkers--don’t show that. Rather, they show that hours have been declining since the\nlate 1990s.\nThere are two other arguments on the side of slowing productivity growth. The\nfirst is related to the recent moderation in the pace of price declines for high-tech goods.\nThis could imply that technological progress is slowing to some extent. Second is the\nrecent weakness in high-tech investment, which would mean that firms may be beginning\nto engage in less so-called capital deepening---in other words, they may not be adding as\nmuch capital to the production process.\nWhile these developments are a source of concern, it’s too soon to tell if they’ll\nlast very long. Moreover, there are a couple of reasons to think that firms may learn to\nuse the technology they already have in place to become more productive, and that could\nkeep productivity growing rapidly over the next several years. First, some evidence\nsuggests that the extraordinarily high rates of investment in high-tech equipment during\nthe second half of the 1990s actually led to a reduction in productivity growth--as much\nas half a percentage point during that period. The reason is that firms had to devote a lot\nof human capital and time to learn how to get the most out of it. If firms continue to\n11\n\nincrease their proficiency in using the technology they already have, this could help keep\nproductivity growing at a robust pace. For example, one of our contacts told us that his\nlaw firm had discovered they could use computer search facilities to look for\nincriminating evidence in email files; that meant less labor on the project and therefore\nreduced legal expenses.\nSecond, one fundamental way that technology enhances productivity is by\nallowing firms to reorganize work-place processes. For example, major banks report\nthat, through ongoing use of technology, they have been able to support growth in\ncustomers and services with fewer staff. A further example is the continuing expansion\nof Wal-Mart and other big-box stores, a trend that has had a dramatic effect on\nproductivity growth in the retail and wholesale sectors. This process of using technology\nto reorganize work processes, of course, takes time. And all signs suggest that it is\nongoing and likely to continue playing out for a good while.\nLet me summarize this discussion of the inflation outlook. When I look at all of\nthe elements that influence inflation--slack, inflation expectations, mark-ups, oil prices,\nthe dollar, and productivity--it seems that the most likely outcome over the next year or\nso is that inflation will remain well contained, which is definitely encouraging.\nMoreover, while I see a lot of uncertainty in the outlook, taken together the risks appear\nto be reasonably well balanced on the upside and the downside.\nMonetary Policy\nI’d like to conclude by returning briefly to where I began—with the FOMC’s\npress statement and the release of the minutes of the last meeting. As I said, my views\nare generally quite consistent with those in the statement. We know that the current\n12\n\npolicy stance is accommodative, and that, as the expansion firms up, that degree of\naccommodation will have to diminish. But the pace of removing policy accommodation\nwill depend on how developments unfold. If the economy expands a good deal faster, or\nif we see the upside risks to inflation materialize, it may be appropriate to remove\naccommodation more rapidly. If the expansion slows, or if we experience some of the\ndownside inflation risks, there will be more opportunities for the Committee to pause.\nI hope that my comments today have illustrated in part how the Committee’s\nconsensus comes from some deep and careful thinking about a wide and complex variety\nof possible developments in the economy, much of which is laid out in the minutes.\nPerhaps I’ve even intrigued some of you who have never read the minutes to take a look\nat them. As I said, the decision to release them sooner is part of an important effort to\nmake the central bank’s decisions in pursuit of price stability and maximum sustainable\nemployment more transparent to the public.\n# # #\n13",

Yellen, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on Monday, March 20, 2006, 9:10 AM Pacific Time, 12:10 PM Eastern\nGood morning. I’m Janet Yellen, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San\nFrancisco. On behalf of the San Francisco Fed and our co-hosts, the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Office of\nThrift Supervision, I’m delighted to welcome you to Las Vegas and to the 2006 National\nCommunity Reinvestment Conference.\nThis is actually the second time we’ve held this conference in Las Vegas. The last time\nwe were here was in 1998, and the city has grown significantly in the last eight years.\nBack then, there wasn’t an Eiffel Tower in the middle of the Strip.1 But there were\nalready signs of community development pressures as a result of the region’s rapid\ngrowth. Since 1998, these pressures have only increased. The poverty rate in the region\nhas increased, and the income gap between rich and poor has grown.2 At the same time,\nhouse values have skyrocketed, and while this growth has had benefits for the local\neconomy, it has also made the area less affordable to low-income families.3\nThis “tale of two cities” highlights the need for community development, and its role in\nensuring that low-income families and neighborhoods benefit from macroeconomic\ngrowth. When we hosted our first community reinvestment conference in the early 1990s,\nit was focused primarily on educating banks about the Community Reinvestment Act. In\nthe past year and a half, the regulatory agencies have issued major revisions to the CRA,\nand, as before, one of the goals of this year’s conference is to help you to understand the\nnew regulations and provide you with information on how to meet your CRA obligations.\nBut this conference is about more than just the letter of the CRA. It’s also about finding\ninnovative solutions to the community development challenges facing fast-growing\nplaces like Las Vegas, older cities like Detroit, and rural areas like California’s Central\nValley. Everyone in this room has made a commitment to expanding opportunity for low-\nincome families and to revitalizing low-income communities. So while the details of the\nCRA regulations are important, the main objective of this conference is to give you the\n1 The Paris hotel was built in 1999.\n2 Peter Fronczek (2005) Income, Earnings, and Poverty from the 2004 American Community Survey. U.S.\nBureau of the Census: American Community Survey Reports ACS-01. The poverty rate in Clark County\nincreased from 9.9 to 12.7 percent between 2000 and 2004. Data from the American Community Survey\nalso show a drop in the median income and a larger proportion of families earning less than $25,000\nbetween 2000 and 2004. A study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities showed that income\ninequality in Nevada increased between 1990 and 2000. Unfortunately, the lack of annual data at the local\nlevel makes it difficult to estimate exactly how much change there has been between 1998 and 2006, but\ninterviews with local nonprofits support this assessment.\n3 National Association of Realtors (2006). Quarterly median house price data, 1998-2005. The data show\nthat house prices in Las Vegas have gone up 151 percent between the first quarter of 1998 and the last\nquarter of 2005.\n\nchance to focus on the underlying goal of your work and to share challenges and best\npractices with your colleagues in the community development field.\nIn my remarks today, I would like to reflect on the ways in which the community\ndevelopment field has changed since the urban renewal programs of the 1950s and 60s.\nThis history demonstrates the tremendous capacity for the field to adapt and to find more\neffective ways of serving low-income families and communities, while at the same time\nreminding us that neighborhood poverty is not something that is easily solved.\nTo give us a framework for understanding the history of community development, I’d\nlike to talk about New Haven, Connecticut, because the urban renewal efforts coincided\nwith my own time there as a graduate student. I moved to New Haven in the late 1960s\nto study economics at Yale University. I was drawn to economics, not, as you might\nthink, as a result of an early fascination with interest rates, but because I wanted to\nunderstand the underlying causes of the Great Depression. At its peak, the number of\nunemployed during the Great Depression stood at over 13 million people.4 To put that\nnumber in perspective, there were nearly twice as many unemployed workers during the\nGreat Depression as there are today, even though our population has more than doubled. 5\nMy passion for economics—and for my job at the Fed—stems from the belief that\nmonetary policy is an important tool that can be used to minimize the likelihood of such\nan event happening again, and to minimize the suffering that an economic downturn can\ninflict on American families and neighborhoods.\nWhen I arrived in New Haven in 1967, the city was at the tail end of one of the most\nmassive and ambitious urban renewal projects in the country. Between 1954 and 1967,\nthe city spent more than 27 million dollars in federal grants to completely rebuild the\ndowntown area—twenty times more per capita than what New York City spent over the\nsame period. 6 Dilapidated tenement buildings were replaced with modern high-rise\napartments. Small commercial streets were converted into shopping malls. And\nneighborhoods were flattened to build freeways linking downtown to the growing\nsuburbs. The city’s mayor proclaimed that urban renewal would “make New Haven the\nfirst slumless city.” President Johnson’s Secretary of Labor called New Haven’s\nredevelopment efforts “the greatest success story in the history of the world.”\nThe success story was short-lived, however, and by the time I arrived in New Haven\nthere was already evidence of the negative impacts of urban renewal on the city and its\nresidents. By 1967, more than 20 percent of New Haven’s population—about 22,000\n4 Estimates of the number of unemployed during the Great Depression fall between 13 million and 15\nmillion people. The 13 million figure is from R.W. Hafer (2005). The Federal Reserve System: An\nEncyclopedia (Wesport and London: Greenwood Press), p. 176.\n5 Fifteenth Census of the United States: 1930; Population Volume II: General Report/Statistical Subjects,\nWashington: US Government Printing Office, 1933, Page 25. The population of the U.S. has gone from\n122,775,046 in 1930 to 281,421,906 in 2000. The unemployment level in February 2006, as reported by\nthe Bureau of Labor Statistics, was 7.2 million.\n6 Douglas W. Rae (2003) City: Urbanism and its End. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, pp.\n324, 353\n\npeople—had been displaced to new neighborhoods.7 More than 2,000 small businesses in\nthe downtown area were also dislocated.8 The city’s low-income families, particularly\nAfrican-American households, were increasingly concentrated in mammoth public\nhousing projects like Elm Haven.9 And the newly built freeways ripped through the\nurban fabric of the city, isolated neighborhoods, and contributed to the exodus to the\nsuburbs. Rather than creating the first slumless city, efforts at urban renewal in New\nHaven had unintended consequences, creating neighborhoods with high levels of\nconcentrated poverty, unemployment, and crime.\nOur understanding of the principles underlying effective community development has\nevolved considerably since 1967. A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to return\nto New Haven and to visit Monterey Place, a HOPE VI project located near Yale\nUniversity.10 Rather than monolithic brick buildings that characterized the Elm Haven\npublic housing project, Monterey Place consists of a mixed-income community with\ntownhouses designed to mimic traditional New England architecture. The development,\nfunded by a mix of public and private dollars, is managed not by the Housing Authority\nbut by a private company. There are efforts to link the community to the neighborhoods\nsurrounding it, and several of the units offer homeownership opportunities for low-\nincome families. The development also includes a new public school and a community\ncenter that offers social services and classes to local residents.\nThe contrast between the urban renewal programs of the 60s and HOPE VI encapsulates\nhow much approaches to community development have changed in the last forty years.\nLet me highlight just four of those changes.\nThe first major change has been in the field of community development finance,\nevidenced by the diversity of institutions and organizations that are represented in the\naudience today. Whereas early efforts at urban renewal were funded largely by\ncentralized federal grants, today’s community development projects are more likely to be\nfinanced by a combination of public and private dollars. The Low Income Housing and\nNew Markets Tax Credit programs, for example, both reflect a shift in the federal\ngovernment’s role in community development. Instead of providing funds directly to\nneighborhoods, these programs encourage private investment by offsetting risk through\ntax incentives and credit enhancements. The community development finance field has\nbecome extremely innovative in the way it secures both equity and debt financing, and\nhas brought a much wider range of investors, lenders, and funders to the table.\nThe second major change has been the shift away from building large public housing\ndevelopments like Elm Haven in New Haven or Cabrini Green in Chicago. Research has\ndocumented the social and economic benefits associated with de-concentrating poverty,\n7 Rae (2003), p. 339.\n8 Rae (2003), p. 343.\n9 Rae (2003), p. 383.\n10 The New Haven Housing Authority received a $46 million HOPE VI grant to demolish and redevelop\nElm Haven. Over a 12-year period, the 805 units at Elm Haven were replaced with approximately 600\nunits, of which 400 are low-income rentals.\n\nwhether by helping families re-locate to higher income neighborhoods or by building new\nmixed-income developments in the place of distressed public housing.11 On balance,\nprograms like HOPE VI have sparked significant improvements in formerly distressed\nneighborhoods.12 These neighborhoods have seen declines in crime and unemployment,\nand increases in neighborhood income, property values, and private investment.\nThe third major change has been a renewed emphasis on developing comprehensive\napproaches to solving neighborhood poverty—strategies that go beyond rebuilding the\n“bricks and mortar” of the community and that focus on expanding opportunity for low-\nincome families. In New Haven, for example, urban renewal replaced dilapidated homes\nwith new buildings, but it did not address other needs like employment opportunities for\ndisplaced factory workers. As some of the sessions in the conference will illustrate, there\nis a better understanding of how to develop holistic approaches to meeting residents’\nneeds by supporting entrepreneurs, providing job training, offering asset building\nproducts, and facilitating transportation and child care.\nThe final change, and perhaps the most important, has been the recognition that resident\nparticipation is vital to the success of any redevelopment effort. In New Haven, the\nrenewal task force did not include any affected residents or businesses, and in the words\nof one federal official, “the community was seething” at what they perceived to be a\ncomplete disregard for their well-being.13 Today’s community development efforts are\nmuch more likely to involve residents in the planning and design of their community,\nencompass a wide range of community groups and partners, and build on local economic\npriorities and assets.\nThese changes in the community development field have fundamentally altered the\ntheory and practice of neighborhood revitalization, and there is evidence of the success of\nthese efforts in many communities across the United States.\nBut, the lessons from the past should also caution us against thinking that there are easy\nsolutions to neighborhood poverty. Even the elements of successful community\ndevelopment that we are talking about at this conference are difficult to implement well.\nFor example, building mixed-income communities—as with HOPE VI—has promoted\neconomic growth and has revitalized a number of distressed neighborhoods. But it has\nalso led to an overall reduction in the number of subsidized rental units for low-income\nresidents, at a time when demand for affordable housing is growing. Moreover, these\nefforts often displace residents from communities where they have established strong\nsocial networks. Are there better ways of revitalizing neighborhoods that don’t involve\n11 For a review of the research findings from the Gautreaux and Moving to Opportunity Demonstration\nprojects, see Bruce Katz (2004).

Research on comprehensive community initiatives shows\nthat the process of community building and revitalization can take decades. How do you\nreconcile this long-term commitment with the need to satisfy the annual reporting\nrequirements of funders, or the short-term expectations of shareholders? Given the\nreality of limited resources, is it really possible to implement programs that address all of\nthe factors that contribute to neighborhood poverty? If not, which problems should be\naddressed first?\nThere are no easy answers to these questions, and I think they underscore the extremely\ndifficult nature of your work. The goal of this year’s conference is to give you an\nopportunity to discuss these difficult questions and to learn from your colleagues. It is\nonly through this type of open engagement and willingness to learn that we will be able\nto foster long-lasting change.\nIn conclusion, I would personally like to recognize the positive impact that your work is\nhaving in low-income communities. Forget for a minute about your “outstanding” CRA\nrating and think instead of the families you helped find a suitable home, the small store\nyou helped to finance, or the savings accounts that you opened. All these activities help\nto strengthen our nation’s low-income communities, and we look forward to hearing\nmore about your successes over the next three days. Thank you. I hope you enjoy the\nconference.",

    "text": "Speech at Sacramento State University’s\nCollege of Business Administration Executive Speaker Series,\nCo-hosted with the Chartered Financial Analysts Society of Sacramento\nSacramento, California\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery February 23, 2007, 12:35 PM Pacific, 3:35 PM Eastern\nThe U.S. Economy in 2007\nGood afternoon, everyone. It’s a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak to you today.\nMy remarks will center on recent developments affecting the U.S. economy and what\nthey may portend for the future and especially for the conduct of monetary policy. I will\nspend some time focusing on housing markets, since they may play a key role in\ndetermining which direction economic activity and inflation will head over the rest of this\nyear. Before I begin, let me note that my comments represent my own views and not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nAs you no doubt remember, the Federal Open Market Committee began to remove\nmonetary stimulus in mid-2004, after a long stretch of keeping the federal funds rate—\nour main policy tool—at a very low level. Altogether, there were 17 consecutive quarter-\npoint increases in the funds rate over about two years. During much of that time, the\neconomy averaged solid growth, absorbing a good deal of the slack in labor and product\nmarkets. The object of the policy tightening was to slow the economy’s growth to a more\nsustainable pace and to foster a gradual decline in inflation, promoting price stability. In\nAugust of last year, the Committee voted to “pause,” that is, not to raise the funds rate\nanother quarter point, but to leave it at 5¼ percent. By then, some of the effects of the\nearlier increases were being felt, as the economy showed signs of slowing, and this gave\nsome sense of reassurance that inflation was likely to moderate from an elevated level.\nThese moves held the promise of setting the economy on a glide path for the proverbial\n“soft landing”—an orderly slowing of growth that avoids the risk of a severe downturn\nwhile producing enough slack in labor and goods markets to relieve inflationary pressures\nand, indeed, to bring inflation down gradually to a more acceptable level than it has\nregistered over the prior year or so.\nIn large measure, the economy has moved within range of this outcome. And at the last\nmeeting of the Committee, the members voted to keep the funds rate at 5¼ percent. But\nas always, there are risks to this forecast that need to be watched closely. At this stage,\nthe predominant risks center on whether inflation will continue to move down gradually.\nThis concern was expressed in the statement following our last meeting, and I’d like to\nelaborate on that point in the remainder of my remarks.\n1\n\nLet me begin with where inflation is right now. Based on our main measure—the price\nindex for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, or the core PCE\nprice index—consumer inflation was 2.2 percent over the past year, which, as I indicated,\nis higher than I would like to see. However, it is encouraging that we have seen some\neasing recently: in the last three months, this index has registered a more acceptable 1.7\npercent annual rate of increase. The core CPI, which came out earlier this week, was on\nthe high side of expectations in January. However, this followed three straight months of\nlow core CPI inflation; after smoothing through the volatility, this measure of inflation\nalso has eased in recent months.\nOne explanation for this decline in inflation involves the impact of stabilizing, and now\nfalling, oil prices. As I mentioned, core inflation, by definition, excludes energy prices,\nbut they still may affect core inflation to the extent that they affect the prices of other\ngoods and services. For example, transport companies might raise their prices to pass\nalong the higher costs of filling their trucks' gas tanks. This is known as \"pass-through,\"\nand it is likely that it has played at least some role in recent movements in core inflation.\nNow that oil prices have fallen a fair bit from recent highs and are expected by futures\nmarkets to remain at those lower levels, this upward pressure on core inflation is likely to\ndissipate and may even be turning into modest downward pressure. However, it’s\nimportant to remember that the effects of oil price changes on inflation are by their very\nnature temporary. So at some point, the fall in oil prices will no longer have a favorable\neffect. Abnormally rapid rent increases, likely reflecting an increase in the demand for\nrental units by would-be owners who have been priced out of the housing market, have\nalso elevated core inflation over the past year. As the housing market adjusts over time,\nhowever, this source of inflationary pressure is also apt to dissipate.\nBeyond these temporary effects, the stability of inflation expectations is another reason to\ntake a positive view and project a gradual diminution of inflation. Expected future\ninflation is one of the factors that businesses consider in setting their prices and that\nworkers consider when they bargain for compensation. These expectations appear to\nhave been well anchored over the past ten years or so as the Fed has established its\ncredibility with the public about both its commitment to and its competence in keeping\ninflation at low and stable rates. One piece of evidence supporting this credibility is that,\nin the face of the recent large oil price increases, we’ve seen stability in survey and\nmarket measures of inflation expectations looking ten years ahead.1\nBy now you are probably asking yourselves, if the inflation rate has been falling and if\ninflation expectations are well anchored, why the concern about risks to the forecast of\ngradually lower inflation? Part of the answer is to be found in the strength of labor\n1 See Bharat Trehan and Jason Tjosvold, “Inflation Targets and Inflation Expectations: Some Evidence\nfrom the Recent Oil Shocks,” FRBSF Economic Letter, 2006-22, September 1, 2006. For a discussion of\nrelated issues, see John Williams, “Inflation in an Era of Well-Anchored Inflation Expectations,” FRBSF\nEconomic Letter, 2006-27, October 13, 2006.\n2\n\nmarkets. The latest data show payroll employment growing at a rather robust pace for all\nof last year. Moreover, the unemployment rate has declined by half a percentage point\nover the past year and now stands at just over 4½ percent; that rate suggests a degree of\ntightness in the labor market, because it is somewhat below common estimates of the rate\nthat can be sustained in the long run without generating rising inflation.\nI say “suggests” a degree of tightening in labor markets because there is uncertainty about\nit. For example, if labor markets are tight, one would expect that labor compensation—\nincluding both wages and benefits—would be rising rapidly. However, the available\ninformation on this provides a mixed picture. We have two broad measures of labor\ncompensation. One, the employment cost index, is showing remarkably restrained\nincreases of only 3¼ percent over the past year, up only slightly from the prior year, and\nthis development would seem to belie tight labor markets. The other measure,\ncompensation per hour, gives a higher reading of about 5 percent. However, this measure\nincludes compensation methods like stock options that are more akin to profits than\nwages. So part of the strength in this measure may not actually indicate a tight labor\nmarket.\nStill, given the probability of some tightness, we would need to see real GDP growth\nremain moderately below its long-run trend for a time to have confidence that the\neconomy is heading for a soft landing with inflation continuing to move lower. The\nimpetus for the needed moderate growth is likely already in train, given the cumulative\neffects of the 17 stepwise increases in the funds rate that began a couple of years ago.\nSince then, short- and intermediate-term interest rates have risen substantially. For\nexample, Treasury bill rates are up by more than 3½ percentage points from mid-2004.\nIt’s true that corporate long-term rates are actually down by around ½ percentage point\nover this period, while conventional fixed mortgage rates are essentially unchanged.\nHowever, variable mortgage rates have risen along with short-term rates. The overall\neffect of such rate changes has been to reduce demand. Not surprisingly, the housing\nsector has been at the leading edge of the overall economic slowdown, and I’d like to turn\nmy attention to that important sector now.\nNationally, growth in spending on residential structures—after adjusting for inflation—\nwas quite strong during 2002 through 2005. The decline started toward the end of 2005\nand residential investment has fallen—in absolute terms—by a total of 13 percent, with\nespecially steep drops over the last two quarters. In fact, during both of those quarters,\nthis sector alone—which represents only a small fraction of U.S. real GDP—subtracted a\nhefty 1¼ percentage points from real GDP growth. Housing starts have followed a\nsimilar pattern, reaching a peak in January 2006 and then falling by roughly 40 percent\nthrough January of this year. That, of course, includes the headline-grabbing plunge for\nJanuary announced last week.\nDespite the continued weakness in housing construction, which as I said enters directly\ninto the calculation of real GDP, there are some signs of stabilization in other aspects of\n3\n\nhousing markets, suggesting that construction activity may level out before too long. For\nexample, home sales have steadied somewhat after falling sharply for a year or so.\nConsidering this in combination with the continued drop in housing starts that I\nmentioned earlier, it is not surprising to find that inventories of unsold homes have begun\nto shrink. This development suggests that the process of resolving the imbalances\nbetween demand and supply in the housing market may be underway, and, as a result, we\ncould very well see the drag on real GDP from housing construction wane later this year.\nOf course, such a turn of events is by no means a given, because the improvements we’ve\nseen may just be temporary. For example, it is possible that they were related to a\ndecline in fixed mortgage rates since the middle of last year, a development that probably\nsupported home sales, at least to some extent. However, the decline in mortgage rates\ncame as a bit of a surprise to me in a period when the FOMC maintained the funds rate\ntarget at 5¼ percent, especially in view of the widely discussed “conundrum” about why\nlong-term interest rates were already so low.2 Therefore, we can’t count on further\ndeclines in mortgage rates to bring the housing market back.\nIn addition to concerns about weakness in housing construction, there has been worry that\ndifficulties related to housing markets could spread to consumer spending more\ngenerally. Since consumption expenditures represent two-thirds of real GDP, even a\nrelatively modest impact from housing markets on this big sector could put a noticeable\ndent in overall economic activity.\nUp to this point, we haven’t seen signs of such spillovers. Consumption spending has\nbeen well maintained, showing a robust growth rate for all of 2006. However, going\nforward, there are at least a couple of ways that spillovers from weakness in housing\ncould depress consumer spending, and these channels bear watching. First, housing\nmakes up a significant fraction of many people’s wealth, so a significant change in house\nvalues can affect consumer wealth and therefore consumer spending. As you know, there\nhave been fears about plummeting house prices. But so far, at least, house prices at the\nnational level either have continued to appreciate, though at a much more moderate rate,\nor have fallen moderately, depending on the price index you look at. Looking ahead,\nfutures markets are expecting small declines in a number of metropolitan areas this year.\nWhile these modest movements are undoubtedly imparting less impetus to consumer\nspending now than during the years of rapid run-ups, their effects are not likely to be\ndramatic.\nThe slowdown in housing market activity has certainly been noticeable here in the\nSacramento area. Previously, the local housing market had been very hot, with home\nprices growing consistently at a double-digit pace from 2000 to 2005, reaching a peak\n2 See Tao Wu, “The Long-Term Interest Rate Conundrum: Not Unraveled Yet?” FRBSF Economic Letter,\n2005-08, April 29, 2005, and Glenn Rudebusch, Eric Swanson, and Tao Wu (2006), “The Bond Yield\n‘Conundrum’ from a Macro-Finance Perspective,” Monetary and Economic Studies 24 (S-1), 83-128.\n4\n\ngrowth rate of about 25 percent in 2004. This was fueled in part by substantial in-\nmigration from other parts of California, notably the Bay Area, and other states; during\nthe first half of this decade, Sacramento was ranked very highly among the nation’s\nmetropolitan areas in its rate of domestic in-migration. This process slowed down as\nhome prices rose and the region’s affordability advantage was eroded. Indeed,\nSacramento was one of the first areas in the state to show signs of the current housing\nslowdown. Prices in this area started to flatten out in early 2006 while they were still\nrising in most of the rest of the state, and building permits fell substantially even before\nthat, in 2005. The slowdown in the local housing market intensified as 2006 progressed,\nand the latest available numbers indicate that in the fourth quarter of last year, sales of\nexisting homes were down about 25 to 30 percent, and prices were down by about 4\npercent.\nThe price decline has been small so far, but it raises fears about a more significant drop.\nSuch fears are understandable, based on the historical experience: between 1991 and\n1996, Sacramento area home prices fell about 15 percent. However, a key difference\nbetween then and now is the overall health of the local economy. While the pace of\nemployment growth slowed last year in the Sacramento area, as it did in the rest of the\nstate, the state government’s fiscal situation has improved over the past few years,\nhelping to create new jobs locally and keeping the area economy on a stable expansion\npath. Continued economic growth of this sort can only help the adjustment in your area\nproceed in an orderly fashion.\nReturning to the national economy, housing market developments also could spread to\nconsumer spending if enough homeowners experienced financial distress. For example,\nrising variable mortgage rates could strain some consumers’ cash flow. What we find,\nhowever, is that, because of the rapid appreciation of home prices in prior years, most\nhomeowners are sitting on a substantial amount of equity, a financial resource that they\ncan fall back on. In particular, adjustable-rate borrowers with equity can avoid a rate\nreset by refinancing. Moreover, only a small fraction of outstanding variable rate\nmortgages are scheduled to be reset in each of the next few years.\nOf course, financial distress could be a bigger problem for some borrowers who used so-\ncalled exotic financing—like interest-only loans, piggy-back loans, and loans with the\npossibility of negative amortization. These instruments are often designed to allow\nsubprime borrowers into the market. In fact, there are signs of trouble for some\nhouseholds. Delinquencies on variable-rate mortgages to subprime borrowers have risen\nsharply since the middle of last year and now exceed 10 percent. But fortunately,\ndelinquency rates for other types of mortgages—including all prime borrowers and even\nsubprime borrowers with fixed-rate loans—have edged up only very modestly. I know\nthat it’s common to see newspaper stories about homeowners who have run into trouble,\nand those situations are, indeed, regrettable. From a national perspective, however, the\n5\n\ngroup with rising delinquencies still represents only a small fraction of the total market,\nwith little impact on the behavior of overall consumption.\nA forward-looking view of the credit risks associated with subprime mortgages can be\nobtained from a new financial instrument related to these mortgages.3 These instruments\nsuggest a big increase in the risk associated with loans made to the lowest-rated\nborrowers, but little change in risk for other higher-rated borrowers. Based on these\nresults, it appears that investors in these instruments expect the losses to be fairly well\ncontained. Of course, a shift in market sentiment about the risk of some of these\nsecurities is always possible. Such a shift would have ramifications for mortgage\nfinancing and housing, likely through tighter credit standards and higher mortgage rates\nfor certain borrowers. In fact, we already have seen some tightening among commercial\nbanks in recent months.4\nThe bottom line for housing is that the concerns we used to hear about the possibility of a\ndevastating collapse—one that might be big enough to cause a recession in the U.S.\neconomy—while not fully allayed have diminished. Moreover, while the future for\nhousing activity remains uncertain, I think there is a reasonable chance that housing is in\nthe process of stabilizing, which would mean that it would put a considerably smaller\ndrag on the economy going forward.\nIn addition to housing, weakness in auto production has slowed the economy during the\npast few quarters. The auto industry has felt the effects of high oil prices and people’s\ngrowing demand for more fuel-efficient vehicles. That has been good news for some of\nthe foreign automakers, but not such good news for U.S. automakers, for which SUVs\nand trucks have been a key source of strength. As the demand for these vehicles dropped,\nproducers found themselves holding unsustainably high inventories. It's little wonder\nthat they slashed production. These production cuts slowed overall real GDP growth in\nthe U.S. last year. However, once the adjustment to a lower level of production is\nreached, probably in the not too distant future, this factor will cease to hold down growth\nin the U.S. economy.\nOutside of housing and domestic autos, the rest of the economy has been doing quite\nwell; that’s why it might be called a “bi-modal” economy. I’ve already mentioned that\nconsumer spending has been robust. Business demand also has been solid, fueled by high\nprofits and relatively favorable financing conditions, leading to healthy growth in\nspending on business investment in structures as well as equipment and software.\nGrowth in investment in high-tech goods has been especially strong and the outlook is\nfavorable, as telecommunications companies expand their fiber-optics networks and\nbusinesses continue to improve their productivity by upgrading their IT equipment.\n3 Credit default swaps (CDS) on securities related to subprime mortgages.\n4 January 2007, Federal Reserve Board, Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey\n(http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/SnLoanSurvey/200701/default.htm).\n6\n\nThe net impact of both the weak and healthy sectors I’ve described has produced\nmoderate real GDP growth rates of 2½ and 2 percent in the second and third quarters of\nlast year. The advance estimate of fourth-quarter growth showed a surge to a strong 3½\npercent rate. However, recent monthly data have been on the weaker side. After\nsmoothing out the volatility, my overall assessment is that economic activity has\nproceeded at a moderate underlying pace for close to a year now.\nIn other words, it looks as if the economy is pretty close to the “glide path” I mentioned\nbefore—since the first quarter of last year, growth has slowed to a bit below most\nestimates of the economy’s long-run potential, and more recently the risk of an outright\ndownturn has receded along with the early signs of stabilization of housing markets. At\nthe same time, while core inflation remains on the high side of what I would like to see, it\nhas begun to ebb modestly in recent months.\nA key question for inflation going forward —and therefore, for monetary policy—is what\nhappens if the drag from housing and autos disappears later this year? As I’ve stressed,\nwith labor markets apparently somewhat tight, something else will need to slow to keep\ngrowth below potential.\nOne possibility is consumer spending. Growth in that sector seems likely to slow\nbecause of a diminishing impetus from household wealth, as house prices increase less\nrapidly and as past increases in interest rates impose a greater drag. In general, it\nwouldn’t be surprising to see a slowdown in consumer spending given that the personal\nsaving rate—the fraction of income not spent—has fallen to very low levels in recent\nyears and even into negative territory! There are good reasons for much of the drop in\nthe saving rate over the past decade, including the rapid growth in household wealth from\nhousing and the stock market. Given the extremely low recent level of saving, it\nwouldn’t be shocking to see some rebound in the saving rate. That said, the saving rate\nhas been falling for more than a decade, so it’s obviously risky to put too much reliance\non an upswing this year.\nIn summary, I believe that a soft landing is the most likely outcome over the next year or\ntwo. However, I hope my remarks so far make it abundantly clear that there are sizeable\nrisks to this forecast and that I am especially concerned about the upside risks to our\ninflation forecast.\nThese considerations play a key role in my views on monetary policy. I have supported\nthe decision to hold policy steady at the current rate despite inflation remaining higher\nthan I would like it to be. Let me be clear that I do want inflation to move down, but as I\njust indicated with my forecast, I believe policy may now be well-positioned to foster\nexactly such an outcome. Moreover, I continue to support the bias in policy toward\ntightening precisely because it gives due consideration to the upside risks to inflation.\n7\n\nI’m casting my statements about the outlook in very conditional terms because of the\ngreat uncertainty that surrounds any economic forecast. This uncertainty argues for\npolicy to be responsive to the data as it emerges. The decision to keep policy on hold\nallows us more time to observe the data so that appropriate adjustments can be made to\nachieve our goals of maximum stainable employment and price stability.\n###\n8",

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Economic Mobility: Research and Ideas on Strengthening Families,\nCommunities, and the Economy,” a community development research conference\nsponsored by the Federal Reserve System\nWashington, D.C.\nApril 2, 2015\n\nIt is my pleasure to welcome you to the Federal Reserve System’s community\ndevelopment research conference, which this year focuses on economic mobility. I\nwould like to commend the organizers for their foresight in choosing a topic that has\nrisen to the top of the global agenda. According to a recent Pew Research Center survey,\nthe gap between rich and poor now ranks as a major concern in the minds of citizens\naround the world. In advanced economies still feeling the effects of the Great Recession,\npeople worry that children will grow up to be worse off financially than their parents\nwere. In the United States, roughly 80 percent of Americans across the ideological\nspectrum see inequality as a moderately big or very big problem.1\nEconomic inequality has long been of interest within the Federal Reserve System.\nIn 2007, Chairman Bernanke delivered a speech on the causes of rising inequality that\nraised questions about the implications of this disturbing trend for economic\nopportunity--the topic that will be explored at this conference today and tomorrow.2\nChairman Bernanke’s speech called for more research to understand the causes and the\neffects of widening inequality in the United States. Last October, I drew on the Fed’s\nSurvey of Consumer Finances--a rich source of data for researchers in this field--to\nexplore some factors that may influence economic mobility, such as access to quality\neducation and ownership of a family business, and I discussed how those factors may\nhave changed over time.3 But I noted the difficulty of reaching definitive conclusions\n1 See Pew Research Center (2014), “Emerging and Developing Economies Much More Optimistic than\nRich Countries about the Future” (Washington: PRC, October), www.pewglobal.org/files/2014/10/Pew-\nResearch-Center-Inequality-Report-FINAL-October-17-2014.pdf.\n2 See Ben S. Bernanke (2007), “The Level and Distribution of Economic Well-Being,” speech delivered at\nthe Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce, Omaha, Neb., February 6,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20070206a.htm.\n3 See Janet L. Yellen (2014), “Perspectives on Inequality and Opportunity from the Survey of Consumer\nFinances,” speech delivered at the Conference on Economic Opportunity and Inequality, sponsored by the\n\n- 2 -\nand, like Chairman Bernanke, expressed my hope that more research would be dedicated\nto finding answers to these important questions.\nI hope that the work that has been gathered and will be presented and discussed at\nthis conference--as well as the research it may inspire--will further this worthy goal. In\ncarrying out its responsibilities, the Federal Reserve serves the public in a number of\ndifferent ways, and I believe an important contribution comes via the Fed’s role as a\nresearch institution. Separate from the work that directly supports the Fed’s decisions on\nmonetary policy and financial oversight, Fed economists and other researchers in\nWashington and at each of the 12 Reserve Banks are engaged in a broad array of\nindependent academic research aimed at adding to the general knowledge and\nunderstanding of the economy.\nEach year, Fed staff members publish hundreds of papers and others forms of\nresearch, sometimes in collaboration with scholars from universities and other\ninstitutions, all of it available for use by the research community and on view to the\npublic. Conferences play an integral role in promoting the Federal Reserve’s research\nmission as well. This biennial community development research conference, organized\nby community development officials from across the Federal Reserve System, serves to\nencourage high-quality research and also helps bridge the gap between community\ndevelopment research, policy, and practice.\nIn my brief remarks, I would like to mention a few aspects of economic mobility\nthat I think are particularly important and worthy of further research, with the hope of\nstimulating the conversation that will take place here over the next couple of days. This\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston, Boston, Mass., October 17,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20141017a.htm.\n\n- 3 -\nconference will explore economic mobility as it is influenced by or affects families,\ncommunities, and the economy, so let me touch on each of those three facets.\nWe know that families are the locus of both opportunities and barriers to\neconomic mobility. There are important research questions to be tackled here. What\nindividual or family characteristics may predict who will achieve upward mobility? How\nmuch does someone’s initial circumstances in life influence how far that person can get\nor how hard he or she needs to work to get there? Researchers and policymakers need a\nbetter understanding of how much mobility individuals may experience over the course\nof their lives and at what age people’s outcomes may become more difficult to change.\nFamilies are the source of many of the resources and experiences that influence\neconomic mobility, and more research can help us understand to what extent and in\nwhich ways differences in the economic circumstances of families affect the upward\nmobility and economic security of offspring. Research may be able to provide evidence\non which public policies are most helpful in building an economy in which people are\npoised to get ahead. Conversely, it would also be beneficial to understand whether any\npolicies may hold people back or discourage upward mobility.\nThere is some debate on how the level of economic mobility in the United States\nmay have changed in recent decades and whether it is easier or more difficult for people\nto get ahead today than it was in previous generations. Shortly, you will hear from a\npanel of distinguished experts with a range of views on this topic. Looking at the very\nrecent past, we should also be asking whether and how this may have changed coming\nout of the Great Recession. Later, my Federal Reserve Board colleague, Governor\nBrainard, will speak on a topic of significant interest to me and I expect to many others--\n\n- 4 -\nhow young adults are faring in the economy and what the short- and long-term\nimplications may have been for entering the job market at a time of significantly\nconstrained opportunities. This is another example of how exogenous factors--those over\nwhich individuals have little or no control--may play an important role in determining\nhow easily someone is able to improve his or her circumstances.\nCommunities also affect economic mobility, and here, too, more research is\nneeded to understand how and to what extent these effects occur. Economists do not\nfully understand how locational differences affect economic mobility or the complex\nrelationship between economic mobility and geographic mobility. There are community\ncharacteristics--for instance, the composition and level of local employment, schools,\ntransportation, physical infrastructure, and community facilities--that may affect the\neconomic mobility of the residents of that community. And there is also a community\ndevelopment analogue to economic mobility: Further research may help us better\nunderstand why some communities succeed or fail in generating jobs, developing\nsuccessful small businesses, attracting infrastructure investment, and so on. How do\nsome places advance economically and create circumstances in which residents, in turn,\nare more likely to thrive?\nFinally, there are important research questions to be answered about the\nrelationship between economic mobility and the economy as a whole. It seems obvious\nthat greater economic opportunity and mobility promotes a healthier economy.\nEntrepreneurship, innovation, and hard work--surely key contributors to individual\nmobility--are central to a strong economy as well. But research could help us better\nunderstand how much mobility at the individual level matters for overall growth in\n\n- 5 -\nproductivity and economic output. To what extent is income mobility influenced by\ndomestic or global economic forces, and to what extent can we promote mobility through\ndomestic policy choices?\nThese are among the questions that will be discussed and debated at this\nconference. You have a terrific lineup of speakers, and I think it is going to be a\nfascinating and informative two days. Thank you again to the many people at the Federal\nReserve Bank of St. Louis, the Federal Reserve Board, and from across the System who\nhave put this conference together. And thanks to all of you for coming here to be a part\nof it.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n4:00 p.m. EDT (3:00 p.m. CDT)\nSeptember 29, 2016\nA Conversation with Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen\n(via videoconference)\nRemarks by\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Banking and the Economy: A Forum for Minority Bankers”\nSponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\nKansas City, Missouri\nSeptember 29, 2016\n\nThank you, and I also would like to thank the organizers of this forum for\narranging for me to be part of your conversation, on a day when other business\nunfortunately prevents me from travelling to Kansas City.\nAnd I am really looking forward to hearing from all of you on what I expect will\nbe a range of topics, but I thought I might start with a few remarks about something of\nconsiderable interest to me, which is diversity and inclusion.\nI think the Kansas City Fed is an excellent place to discuss this issue because of\nthe recognition it has received for promoting diversity and inclusion, both among\nbusinesses and other organizations in the 10th District and in its own ranks. I know that\nthe Bank is continuing to hold Diversity Summits with firms and community groups, the\nmost recent of which was last month. In various ways, it is also promoting diversity\namong its own staff and senior leaders through recruiting, hiring and promotions, and is\nclosely tracking progress. The Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce singled out\nthe Bank this year for its diversity efforts from among 20 organizations and businesses.\nI believe these efforts reflect a commitment to diversity that is found throughout\nthe Federal Reserve System, and I would like to talk a bit about the basis for that\ncommitment, starting with why it is that diversity, in its different forms, is so important.\nOne reason that the Fed organizes conferences such as this one is to facilitate\ncommunication. In this case, we want to communicate with you, as leaders of institutions\nwe oversee and are otherwise affected by our decisions. We want to understand your\nviews and try to explain what we are trying to accomplish. Such communication would\nnot be effective if only one or just a few banks in the 10th District were part of the\nconversation. Today’s forum includes bankers from smaller community banks, regional\n\n- 2 -\nbanks, and large banks because the roles of your institutions in your communities differ,\nand hearing your different views provides a fuller picture of the industry’s views.\nSimilarly, it is important to include in the conversation bankers of diverse backgrounds,\nwhich is why it is important that we hear from minority bankers.\nIn these examples, diversity in its various forms is a source of strength, which is\nsomething that we as financial regulators understand very well. The Federal Reserve\nsupports an ongoing role for community banks in part because diversity among financial\ninstitutions promotes a stable and healthy financial system, spurring competition and\nensuring that customers of all types have access to a wide variety of services. The\nFederal Reserve supports the Partnership for Progress, which assists and advises\nminority-owned financial institutions, because we believe that those institutions are\nlikewise a source of diversity that contributes to a healthy financial system.\nI expect it is not news, either, to bankers, that diversity is a source of strength.\nEvery day, in serving customers, bankers can see the strength that comes from diversity--\nthe wisdom of diversification in investment decisions, in diverse product lines for the\nbusinesses you lend to, and especially in the strength of diverse communities.\nDiversity also strengthens organizations by making it possible to have a wide\nvariety of views available. It helps ensure that individuals within those organizations\nhave the opportunity to shine and employ their talents to the fullest and that their best\nideas are heard and acted on. The banks you serve are better able to reach new\ncustomers, especially groups of customers who have historically been underbanked, when\nthey show that serving those customers is a top priority. And one of the most effective\nways of showing a commitment to a diverse customer base is showing a commitment to a\n\n- 3 -\ndiverse workforce. Demographic trends indicate that minorities will be an increasing\nshare of the population in the years and decades ahead, and thus an increasing share of\nnew customers for your institutions.\nMy organization, the Federal Reserve, is also committed to a diverse workforce\nand to diversity in our senior leadership. The Federal Reserve is pursuing this goal not\nonly for all of the practical reasons I have cited to seek diversity, but also because it is the\nright thing to do. I want to be clear to all of you that I am committed to improving\ndiversity throughout our organization, including at the upper ranks. Diversity is also\nimportant on the boards of directors and advisory councils of Reserve Banks. I hope, in\nfact, that in this room today there are individuals who one day may serve as an advisor,\ndirector or even a Reserve Bank President or member of the Board of Governors.\nImproving diversity requires effort and constant focus. We will continue working\nhard to achieve this goal. I believe it is as vital to the Federal Reserve as it is to your\nemployers, and to every employer, to improve diversity and extend opportunity to\neveryone.",

    "text": "Presentation to the California Chamber of Commerce\nSan Francisco, CA\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery Friday, December 2, 2005 11:00 AM Pacific, 2:00 Eastern\nThe U.S Economy: 2005 in Review and Prospects for 2006\nGood morning, and thanks very much for inviting me today. I’m delighted to be\nhere with you. As 2005 draws to a close, it’s a good time to take a look back at the year\nthat has passed and to think about what may lie ahead for the U.S. economy in 2006. In\ntaking this retrospective and prospective approach, I’m going to organize my remarks\naround three broad topics. The first is employment and output growth. The second is\ninflation. Not surprisingly, energy prices factor significantly into developments in both\nrealms and are relevant in shaping the risks going forward. My third and last topic is the\nconduct of monetary policy, and here I plan to touch on one of the legacies of Chairman\nGreenspan. As you no doubt know, at the end of January, he is stepping down after 18\nyears of distinguished service to the Federal Reserve and to the country, and Ben\nBernanke will then, in all likelihood, have been confirmed by the Senate and will\ntherefore be in a position to assume the Chairmanship. The Greenspan legacy I want to\nfocus on is this: the public’s increased confidence in the Fed’s commitment to price\nstability, and the Fed’s increased transparency about monetary policy. In particular, I\nwill give you some of my thoughts about how greater central bank credibility and\ntransparency enhance the conduct of monetary policy and the stability of the U.S.\neconomy.\nLooking back at 2005, clearly one of the most dramatic events was the one-two\npunch of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. It goes without saying that the economic\n1\n\nconsequences for the Gulf Coast region have been enormous. More than a million people\nhave been displaced, thousands of businesses and jobs have been disrupted or destroyed,\nand the infrastructure—notably for energy—took a severe beating.\nWhen the hurricanes hit at the end of August, the economy had been doing quite\nwell. Over the preceding two years, monetary accommodation and robust productivity\ngrowth supported economic activity. Real GDP grew steadily at, or above, its potential\nor long-run sustainable pace, which is estimated at three to three and a quarter percent.\nThis pattern continued even during the third quarter, when real GDP is estimated to have\ngrown by four and a quarter percent. With this stretch of near or above-trend growth in\neconomic activity, slack in resource use has gradually, but steadily, diminished—that is,\njobs have increased by more than enough to absorb a growing workforce, and the\nunemployment rate has declined. Indeed, for October and November, unemployment\ncame in at 5 percent, a number that’s near conventional estimates consistent with so-\ncalled “full employment.” At the same time, capacity utilization in American industry\nhas risen—although, at 79 percent, it is still somewhat lower than its long-run average.\nMoreover, signs point to another robust performance in the fourth quarter, so growth for\nthe last half of 2005 could well come in noticeably above the potential rate.\nThis positive performance suggests that the overall economy has been quite\nresilient in absorbing the impact of the storms. For 2006, it seems likely that this strength\nwill continue in the first half, as rebuilding kicks in. Then, in the second half, a couple of\nfactors are likely to cause economic growth to settle into a trend-like pattern. One of the\nfactors is the winding down of the rebuilding effort. The other is the lagged effect of\n2\n\nmonetary policy tightening; in other words, tighter financial conditions will have some\ndampening impact on interest-sensitive sectors, such as consumer durables and housing.\nAn important factor shaping the outlook, of course, is energy prices. Over the\nyear and a half before the storms, energy prices had surged worldwide, with the price of\noil nearly doubling and the price of natural gas rising by about two-thirds. Energy prices\nspiked following the storm, but they retreated fairly quickly. At this point, oil and\nwholesale and retail gasoline prices are actually below those prevailing before the storms,\nthough they are still a good deal higher than they were a year and a half ago. Finally,\nnatural gas prices have fallen substantially, but now are above pre-hurricane levels.\nOf course, we normally would expect the year-and-a-half-old energy price surge\nto push down spending. This is because the additional amount that households are forced\nto spend for the same quantities of gasoline, natural gas, heating oil, and other energy-\nintensive products tends to diminish their ability to spend on other goods and services.\nLikewise, firms feel the bite in narrower profit margins, which may crimp the amount\nthey decide to spend on investment in plant and equipment.\nRecent data suggest, however, that consumer spending has held up well so far.\nFor example, although personal consumption expenditures were up only modestly in\nOctober, they were held down by a big drop in auto sales that probably reflected reduced\nsales incentives; outside of autos, personal consumption expenditures were robust,\ndespite the surge in energy prices and plummeting confidence. Indicators of business\nspending and output also have held up well. It is possible that higher energy prices have\nhad a negative impact on consumer spending, but the drag from this factor has been offset\nby other stimuli to spending such as rising home prices and growth in disposable income.\n3\n\nBut for now, at least, it appears that the national economy has come through the twin\nshocks of the hurricanes and the year and a half long escalation in energy prices quite\nwell. Concerns about downside risks to the economy seem much smaller than just a few\nmonths ago.\nThis is definitely good news, but uncertainties do remain—especially during a\nperiod like this, when the stance of monetary policy is changing. It’s inherently difficult\nto judge the exact magnitude and timing of the effects of removing policy\naccommodation. Therefore, it will be very important to monitor this situation in the\nmonths ahead, particularly if, as seems likely, there is cooling in the housing market and\nother interest-sensitive sectors.\nMy focus so far has been on developments that relate to the Fed’s objective of\nkeeping the economy operating in the vicinity of full employment. However, like central\nbanks worldwide, the Federal Reserve is also keenly focused on maintaining price\nstability. One particularly comprehensive measure of consumer prices that the Fed\nmonitors closely is the index for personal consumption expenditures—the so-called PCE\nprice index. Inflation in this measure has jumped to 3.3 percent over the last twelve\nmonths, reflecting large increases in energy prices. However, energy prices, like food\nprices, tend to be quite volatile. So a better measure of underlying inflation—one that\ntells us more about where inflation is likely to be in the longer run—is so-called core\ninflation, which excludes the energy and food components. Inflation by this measure is\nup by a much more moderate 1.8 percent over the twelve months ending in October.\nI have previously enunciated that, in my view, core PCE inflation in a range of 1\nto 2 percent constitutes an appropriate price stability objective for the Fed. Since 1.8\n4\n\npercent is in the upper portion of this comfort range, I’d be happier if this measure were\nsomewhat lower. And, indeed, it is lower if we look over a shorter horizon. For the six\nmonths ending in October, core PCE inflation came in at 1.6 percent at an annual rate—\nwhich is near the middle of my preferred range. This suggests to me that core inflation\nhas been essentially compatible with the Fed’s price stability objective, even in the face\nof a rather large oil shock that started well before Katrina.\nLooking ahead, I’m generally fairly optimistic about the future for inflation,\nthough I do think there are upside risks—mainly having to do with energy prices—that\nrequire vigilance by the FOMC in the period ahead. Let me start with the optimistic\nfactors. First, productivity growth has remained quite strong, and growth in labor costs\nhas remained modest so far. Second, although there is probably little if any slack in labor\nmarkets at this point in the cycle, the economy does not appear to have overshot full\nemployment. Furthermore, there still appears to be a bit of unused capacity left in the\nindustrial sector.\nWith regard to energy, it’s certainly a good sign that—so far—higher energy\nprices have not been passed through to higher non-energy or core prices to a significant\nextent. I want to emphasize the “so far” part of that statement, because any sign of a\nmore significant pass-though would be a concern for monetary policy. One need only\nthink of the 1970s to know what I’m referring to. At that time, higher oil prices were\nassociated with a wage-price spiral that pushed inflation into double-digit territory.\nNaturally, much research has gone into analyzing what happened during that\nperiod, and I’m glad to report that the research suggests major differences between then\nand now. One of the key findings concerns the role that inflation expectations play in\n5\n\ngenerating the wage-price spiral. To sum up a great deal of literature very briefly, the\nidea is that under some circumstances inflation expectations can be like self-fulfilling\nprophecies. If people expect higher inflation, they will behave in the marketplace in\nways that will actually generate higher inflation; for example, they will rush to make\npurchases thinking that tomorrow’s price will be higher than today’s. And they will tend\nto build higher expected inflation into wage bargaining; this raises costs to businesses,\nwhich, in turn, may get built into the prices of their products. Unwinding the inflationary\nspiral is, to put it mildly, not fun. In the early 1980s, the Fed had to do it by slamming\nhard on the brakes, and the costs were high—the economy went through a large double-\ndip recession, and the unemployment rate hit 10 percent in 1982.\nWhat’s different now? Since the early 1980s, the Fed has continued to work to\nlower the inflation rate with considerable success, so that over the last ten years core PCE\ninflation has averaged a moderate 1.7 percent. With this history of low inflation, it’s\nnatural that the public would expect inflation to remain in a low range. As economists\nexpress it, inflation expectations have become “well anchored” to price stability—most\nlikely because people are confident that the Fed will act to limit any potential rise in\ninflation. This may account for research results suggesting that, during this period,\nenergy price increases have generally not been passed through to core inflation.1\nWe actually have some evidence on people’s current inflation expectations.\nOne source of information comes from responses to surveys about inflation\nexpectations. A University of Michigan survey taken shortly after the hurricanes hit\nrecorded a large jump in inflation expectations—for the overall CPI—over the next\n1 Bharat Trehan, “Oil Price Shocks and Inflation,” FRBSF Economic Letter, Number 2005-28, October 28,\n2005.\n6\n\ntwelve months, and a smaller increase in expectations for the next ten years. But I\nwould not read too much into this, since the near-term survey results reflect the impact\nof energy price developments; of course, the higher near-term result also affects the\naverage increase expected over the next ten years.\nAnother source of information on inflation expectations comes from analyses\nusing a financial instrument that is called Treasury Inflation-Protected Security, or\nTIPS for short. The key feature of TIPS is that the payments to investors adjust\nautomatically to compensate for the actual change in the CPI. By comparing yields on\nthese securities with those on standard Treasury securities that are not indexed to\ncompensate for inflation developments, we can estimate what the market thinks inflation\nwill do over the life of the securities.\nIn other words, using this kind of analysis, we can estimate inflation\nexpectations over various time horizons.2 Compensation for average inflation over the\nnext five years rose by about ¼ percentage point in the month following Katrina, but\nhas since dipped below pre-hurricane levels. Furthermore, it is notable that longer-term\ninflation expectations—those covering the period from five years ahead to ten years\nahead—are slightly below the level that prevailed when oil prices started to rise in early\n2004. This development supports the view that the public has confidence in the\nFOMC’s commitment to price stability, even in the face of a large energy price shock.\nThis brings me to my last point, the conduct of policy. Clearly, for monetary\npolicymakers, the public’s confidence in our commitment to price stability is a very\nhelpful thing. As I’ve just indicated, well-anchored inflation expectations themselves are\n2 Simon Kwan, “Inflation Expectations: How the Market Speaks,” FRBSF Economic Letter, Number 2005-\n25, October 3, 2005.\n7\n\nlikely helping to contain the inflationary pressures associated with higher energy prices.\nTherefore, policy’s response to those pressures can be more tempered than “slamming on\nthe brakes,” and that means running less of a risk of pushing the economy into a deep\nrecession. Public confidence is helpful in other circumstances, too. If there’s a sudden\ndrop in demand, the Committee can ease to offset it without worrying that the public will\nthink policy is on a path toward overstimulation that would generate inflation. Stable\ninflation expectations allow monetary policy to respond to shocks without having to pitch\nthe economy too far in one direction or the other; in other words, credibility facilitates the\npursuit of our dual mandate for price stability and “full” employment—the two main\npolicy goals articulated in the Federal Reserve Act.\nHow has the Committee established credibility? First, of course, as I said,\ninflation has come down markedly over the past twenty-five years and stayed low for\nquite some time. I don’t want to give all the credit for this to monetary policy, because,\nof course, rapid productivity growth has played an important role as well. But the\nCommittee has been diligent about the actions it has taken—setting policy to lower\ninflation gradually and to keep it low.\nIn keeping with this strategy, at the November meeting, the Committee voted to\ncontinue its gradual removal of policy accommodation and raised the federal funds rate\ntarget to four percent. The objective of this policy action—as well as any future\nactions—is to position the economy on a trajectory characterized by “full employment”\nand price stability. Such a so-called glide path requires that as slack in labor markets is\nabsorbed, real output growth must converge toward a sustainable long-run pace at the\nsame time that inflation is at its desired rate.\n8\n\nIn addition to actions such as this, I believe the Committee has reinforced its\ncredibility with the public by becoming more transparent and focusing on\ncommunication. By this I mean that the Committee has made a significant effort to let\nthe public know what it has done and why in recent years. Let me recount quickly the\nsteps toward greater transparency which began in 1994. First, the Committee started\nissuing post-meeting press releases that explicitly announced changes in the federal funds\nrate target; then it added descriptions of the state of the economy and the rationale for the\npolicy action to the release; then it introduced a statement describing the “balance of\nrisks” to the outlook; then it began releasing the votes of individual Committee members\nand the preferred policy choices of any dissenters; then it added explicit language\nconcerning future policy to its post meeting press release; and finally, it decided to\nrelease the minutes of its meetings with a much shorter delay—only three weeks instead\nof five to eight weeks—so that now the minutes appear before the next meeting, instead\nof after it.\nTransparency is helpful not only in building credibility, but it is also helpful in\nanother important way. By letting everyone in on its current thinking, the Committee\nhelps to align expectations, including those in financial markets, with its best estimate of\nwhere policy is likely to go. A good example of this was in 2003, when it appeared that\nthere was a threat of outright deflation. This was a potentially serious situation and the\nCommittee wanted to lean on the side of an accommodative policy until the threat had\npassed. The statement said that “In these circumstances, the Committee believes that\npolicy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period.” I think this\n9\n\nforward-looking language was helpful in keeping long-term interest rates lower than they\notherwise would have been, which helped to reduce the risk of deflation.\nAnother example is what happened following the recent hurricanes. Before the\nSeptember FOMC meeting, there was a great deal of speculation about the Committee’s\nresponse to the potential for a simultaneous slowdown in growth and rise in inflation.\nThe September release stated that “While these unfortunate developments have increased\nuncertainty about near-term economic performance, it is the Committee's view that they\ndo not pose a more persistent threat.” It went on to say that, “the Committee believes that\npolicy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.” I believe\nthat these clarifications and signals about future actions helped avoid confusion about the\nCommittee’s perspective and contributed importantly to making policy more effective.\nAs I said, the sentences about where policy is likely to go reflect the Committee’s\nbest estimates. And best estimates, of course, are always subject to revision. So I want\nto emphasize that, in my view, the Committee must always have the flexibility to respond\nto changing circumstances. Indeed, the statement typically includes language along those\nlines. For example, in November, the statement said “the Committee will respond to\nchanges in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price\nstability.”\nIf you look at the minutes from the November meeting, you will see that the\nstatement is currently a subject of discussion. Two phrases in particular are at issue:\n“remove accommodation” and “at a measured pace.” While it seems unlikely that the\nend of the current tightening phase is yet at hand, there obviously will come a time when\nthese two phrases are no longer appropriate, and other changes to the statement may be\n10\n\nneeded as well. As the November minutes suggest, going forward, the Committee will\npay close attention to incoming data and weigh options carefully in assessing the stance\nof policy and the wording of the statement.\nI started this discussion of the conduct of policy by saying that public confidence\nin the Committee’s commitment to price stability is a helpful thing. As I've indicated, I\nbelieve that this public confidence has strengthened under Chairman Greenspan's\nleadership of the Fed, with years of consistently low inflation and a communication\nstrategy that has made the conduct of U.S. monetary policy more transparent to the\npublic. I’d like to close by saying that public confidence is also a very valuable thing—\nand like all valuable things, it is hard to win and easy to lose. For my part, this must\nmean ensuring—in both deeds and words—that, as developments unfold, our economy\ndoes not suffer from an unacceptable rise in inflation.\n11",

Lopez\nFinancial institutions are increasingly using economic capital models to help determine the amount of capital they need to\nabsorb unexpected losses. These models typically aggregate capital based on business-level analysis. However, important\nchallenges surround this aggregation as well as other aspects of these models. Supervisors could use these capital\ncalculations when they assess capital adequacy, but they need to be aware of these modeling issues.\nFinancial institutions are in the business of managing and reallocating risk. An important part of risk\nmanagement is having an appropriate level of capital as a buffer against unexpected losses. A key\nquestion is how much capital to hold. Too little would leave an institution exposed to losses that could\nlead to bankruptcy, while too much is expensive in terms of foregone business opportunities. Since the\nfailure of individual institutions has a large impact on the financial system as a whole, government\nsupervisors have put in place regulatory capital requirements. However, managers still must make their\nown determination of how much capital their institution should hold, given its current risk exposures and\nbusiness model.\nThe general name for this determination is economic capital calculation, which can be viewed as an\nextension of the capital calculations made for individual business lines based on their risk exposures and\npotential losses, such as credit losses on a loan portfolio. The idea is to measure all risk exposures using\nmainly quantitative techniques and decide how much capital to hold in light of potential losses. A recent\nreport by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS 2009) argues that no consensus on how\nto calculate economic capital has developed. In this Economic Letter, I review some of the methods\ncurrently used for economic capital calculations and discuss the associated challenges and supervisory\nconcerns.\nThe question of economic capital calculation has taken on particular urgency in light of the recent\ndomestic financial crisis. During that period, actual and potential bank losses on mortgage loans and\nmortgage-backed securities led to a sharp decline in bank capital and enhanced systemic concerns\nabout the soundness of the U.S. banking system. Policy responses targeted at the quantity and quality\nof bank capital, such as the Treasury department’s Troubled Asset Relief Program capital injections into\nlarge banking organizations in October 2008 and the Federal Reserve’s Supervisory Capital Assessment\nhttp://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2010/june/challenges-economic-capital-modeling/[2/11/2015 3:53:08 PM]\n\nFederal Reserve Bank San Francisco | Challenges in Economic Capital Modeling |\nProgram stress tests in the spring of 2009, highlight the broader economic importance of this\ncomponent of bank risk management.\nWhat is economic capital?\nEconomic capital is the amount of risk capital, or equity, needed to cover possible unexpected losses that\nmight arise from an institution’s risk exposures. These exposures are measured on a consistent and\nongoing basis as part of an institution’s internal capital assessment processes. Note that capital is\ntargeted at unexpected losses since expected losses should be incorporated into the pricing of the\ninstitution’s products and its loss provisioning.\nIn theory, economic capital can be calculated at various levels, including for the entire institution.\nHowever, since potential losses typically arise from specific business activities or investments,\ncalculations are conducted mostly at the business-line level and then aggregated to determine total\nneeded capital. The amount is calculated for losses over a certain time horizon, such as a year. The\namount also depends on the level of confidence the institution seeks in its ability to absorb losses. For\nexample, having sufficient capital and loan loss provisions for covering losses 99% of the time is a 1%\nconfidence level.\nProcesses for determining economic capital were originally developed as tools for business-line risk\nmanagement. The use of these tools has expanded to include institution-wide risk management and\nrelated analyses. For example, economic capital measures can be used to generate risk-adjusted\nprofitability measures. They can also serve as inputs to decisions regarding whether to expand or\ncontract specific business lines. Financial institutions have increased their use of economic capital\nmodels in response to advances in risk quantification techniques, the growing complexity of institutional\nrisk exposures, and supervisory expectations that institutions develop internal capital-adequacy\nassessments.\nMethods for calculating economic capital\nIn principle, economic capital should be based on exposures to all forms of risk. In practice, the notion of\nwhich risks should be considered and how they should be measured has evolved over time and varies\nacross institutions. Typically, economic capital models encompass possible losses arising from defaulted\nloans (credit risk), financial market fluctuations (market risk), and business operations (operational\nrisk). Quantitative approaches are available for measuring and managing these risks. In practice, a wide\nvariety of methods are used. Certain other types of risk, such as concentration risk or legal risk, are\nassessed using more qualitative methods due to a lack of appropriate data and modeling techniques.\nQuantitative approaches attempt to characterize the entire distribution of potential losses and can\ngenerate several risk measures. The most common are value-at-risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES).\nVaR provides a measure of potential losses at a chosen confidence level, say, 1%, or the second largest\ndaily loss expected over a one-year horizon. ES is a measure of expected losses at or beyond, say, the\n1% level and better characterizes the distribution of extreme losses beyond that level. Both measures\nhave advantages for business-line risk analysis, but neither measure facilitates aggregation across\nbusiness lines.\nFinancial institutions use a variety of assumptions and aggregation methods for institution-wide\neconomic capital calculations. In simple summation, they add individual risk measures. This approach is\nperceived as conservative since it ignores potential diversification benefits and effectively produces an\nupper bound for total economic capital. A related approach is to apply a fixed diversification percentage\nto the summation and thereby impose a diversification benefit. According to the BCBS report, the range\nof diversification percentages was reported to reduce the summed exposure by 10 to 30%. Although\noften ad hoc, these methodologies are easy to calculate and to communicate to senior management,\ngovernment supervisors, security analysts, and shareholders. However, neither method allows for\nhttp://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2010/june/challenges-economic-capital-modeling/[2/11/2015 3:53:08 PM]\n\nFederal Reserve Bank San Francisco | Challenges in Economic Capital Modeling |\nmeaningful interactions between risk types or detailed analysis of possible diversification benefits.\nAggregation using weights derived from a correlation matrix of the various risk types provides greater\nflexibility for measuring diversification benefits. Yet, by focusing on the average correlation between\nrisks, this approach will tend to underestimate the correlations between risk types in periods of\nespecially large losses, or, in other words, the tails of the loss distributions. Academic studies indicate\nthat the degree of diversification in this aggregation technique varies substantially depending on risk\ntypes and the weights applied to them. No one risk aggregation method has been established as best\npractice, but more than 60% of surveyed institutions used a variant of the correlation approach,\naccording to the BCBS report.\nChallenges to implementation\nSeveral other challenges need to be addressed in implementing economic capital models. A key question\nis whether all of an institution’s relevant risk exposures are accounted for. If relevant risks are not\ncaptured, an economic capital calculation cannot provide a reliable measure of risk exposures and\npotential losses. According to the BCBS survey, larger institutions appear to use economic capital\nmodels for quantifiable risks and rely on more qualitative assessments, such as expert judgment or\nstress scenarios, for less quantifiable risks.\nA related implementation challenge is data quality. For some institutions, data regarding specific risk\ntypes are not available or are of poor quality. The institution must either make internal judgments or\nrely on external sources, such as consultants or industry benchmarks.\nEconomic capital calculations must also correctly align the measurement horizon across risk types. For\nexample, aggregating the daily risk measures for an institution’s trading operations and the annual\nmeasures for loan default risk requires assumptions that may not be appropriate in practice. Simple\nmathematical adjustments are often used, but their underlying assumptions can be quite strong and\nmay not suitable for a given institution.\nOnce economic capital calculations have been completed, it is necessary to validate them, that is, to\ngauge their appropriateness and reliability. Like implementation, validation can be challenging. Several\nprocedures have been constructed, but these techniques commonly provide evidence only for or against\nspecific desirable properties of an economic capital model. No standard validation procedure provides a\ncomprehensive measure of model performance. In addition, these procedures are limited in their ability\nto confirm the accuracy of a model’s forecasted tail losses. As a result of these limitations and the\ndearth of relevant data, the ability to validate an economic capital model in relation to an institution’s\nhistorical experience remains at a very preliminary stage.\nSupervisory concerns\nEconomic capital calculations can be useful not only for an institution’s own capital adequacy\nassessment, but also for supervisory purposes. But important concerns must be addressed here as well.\nSupervisors need to have confidence that an institution’s management is devoting necessary resources\nto resolving operational issues. Supervisors will have no obvious preferences for VaR, ES, or any other\nspecific risk measure but should consider the design and appropriateness of measures on an institution-\nby-institution basis. They will want assurances that managers are able to document economic capital\ncalculations and understand their limitations. The credibility of economic capital calculations depends on\nthe willingness and ability of senior management to ensure the integrity of the process and show a\ncommitment to actually using the calculations when making important decisions.\nRobust internal validation is a key supervisory concern. Several qualitative and quantitative techniques\nare available. Examples of more qualitative methods are use tests, which examine whether institutions\nare properly using their economic capital calculations, and qualitative reviews, which look at an\nhttp://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2010/june/challenges-economic-capital-modeling/[2/11/2015 3:53:08 PM]\n\nFederal Reserve Bank San Francisco | Challenges in Economic Capital Modeling |\ninstitution’s documentation of its models and internal validation efforts. Supervisors may also see value\nin internal audits by institutional staff not involved in design and implementation of economic capital\nmodels.\nQuantitative validation methods include comparison of model inputs, such as correlations, with historical\ndata or industry benchmarks. Another common quantitative approach is benchmarking, which requires\ncomparisons of an institution’s economic capital calculations with industry survey results, academic\nstudies, alternative models by outside vendors, and regulatory capital outcomes. Benchmarking has\nlimitations though, including an emphasis on relative model comparisons as opposed to absolute\naccuracy comparisons with observed data. Overall, these methods are only able to confirm that input\nparameters or model outputs are broadly in sync with other sources. They do not assess a model’s\nactual performance.\nIn theory, backtesting could address this concern by comparing observed losses with an economic capital\nmodel’s forecasts of potential losses. Backtesting is useful primarily for risk types that can be\ncharacterized by a quantifiable metric that can be compared with an outcome. That places limits on this\nmethod’s usefulness for aggregate economic capital calculations. Thus, backtesting is not yet a standard\neconomic capital validation component among the institutions surveyed by the BCBS. Stress testing,\nincreasingly used by financial institutions and regulators, is another validation technique that examines\na model under difficult financial scenarios. Model inputs assume stressed conditions and model outputs\nare compared with more typical conditions. Such testing can reveal model limitations that might only\nbecome apparent under unusually adverse conditions. However, stress tests are still limited in their\napplicability, especially for aggregated economic capital calculations.\nEconomic capital models can provide supervisors with information that complements their own\nassessments of institutional risk exposures and capital adequacy, although validation issues need to be\naddressed. Given the wide range of techniques available, creating a layered validation approach could\nprovide supervisors with greater comfort. However, the BCBS report suggests that, while supervisors\nmight benefit from considering an institution’s economic capital calculations, they should not rely on\nthem to assess capital adequacy.\nConclusion\nSignificant methodological, implementation, and business challenges remain concerning the application\nof economic capital models to financial institutions’ internal assessments of capital adequacy. However,\nthe trend is toward refinement of and greater reliance on these models. Supervisors should encourage\nthis trend and make use of economic capital models to the extent prudent.\nJose A.

    "text": "Stabilization Policy: A Reconsideration\nJanet L. Yellen and George A. Akerlof*\nJuly 1, 2004\n* Janet Yellen is President of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and Eugene E. and\nCatherine M. Trefethen Professor of Business and Professor of Economics at the University of\nCalifornia at Berkeley. George Akerlof is Koshland Professor of Economics at the University of\nCalifornia at Berkeley. This paper forms the basis for Janet Yellen’s Presidential Address to the\nWestern Economic Association, delivered July 1, 2004 in Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nI. Introduction\nIn 1936 Keynes’s General Theory explained how fiscal and monetary policy could be\nused to end depressions. Since that time no developed country has ever seen a downturn on the\nscale of the 1930s. The General Theory was not just a how-to book on the avoidance of\ndepressions. It was an argument for stabilization policy itself.\nThe years since The General Theory have seen a revolt against Keynesian economics. In\na revisionist mode, Milton Friedman argued that countercyclical policy cannot affect the average\nlevel of unemployment and output. Robert Lucas and Thomas Sargent (1979) went further,\ncontending that it is not only impossible to increase average output; it is also impossible to\nstabilize it. More recently, Lucas (1987, 2003) has argued that policies to stabilize output, even\nif effective, would yield negligible welfare gains. Thus, stabilization policy should not be a\nmacroeconomic priority.\nLucas’s conclusion notwithstanding, stabilization policy has long been an explicit or\nimplicit objective of monetary policy in most industrial countries, even including those countries\nwith inflation targets. The volatility of output has, in fact, declined in most major industrial\ncountries since the mid-1980s, and monetary policy arguably deserves at least partial credit.1\nMirroring practice, monetary policy research commonly takes it as “given” that, along with price\nstability, stabilization policy—the minimization of squared deviations of output around\npotential—is an appropriate policy objective.2 In this paper we explore the economic rationale\nfor stabilization as a policy goal, concluding that it does, in fact, deserve high policy priority.\nWe survey a large body of literature that critiques the validity of key assumptions in Lucas’s\nargument. We also offer suggestive evidence that stabilization policy can significantly reduce\n1 See Bernanke (2004).\n2 See, for example, Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (1999).\n\n2\naverage levels of unemployment by providing stimulus to demand in circumstances where\nunemployment is high but underutilization of labor and capital does little to lower inflation. A\nmonetary policy that vigorously fights high unemployment should, however, also be\ncomplemented by a policy that equally vigorously fights inflation when it rises above a modest\ntarget level. The Federal Reserve Act thus wisely enunciated price stability and maximum\nemployment as twin goals for monetary policy.\nII. The Case Against Stabilization Policy\nMacroeconomic analysis typically assumes that social welfare depends negatively on\nboth inflation (above a modest target level, here assumed zero) and unemployment (above some\nminimum, socially efficient level). For example, a standard social welfare function is the\ndiscounted sum of period losses (L) of the form:3\nt\n(1) L =a(u −(1−k)u*)2 +bπ2,\nt t t\nwhere u and π are the unemployment and inflation rates in period t, and u* is the natural rate\nt t\nof unemployment. The coefficient k is positive, reflecting the desirability of unemployment\nbelow the natural rate. Because real economies deviate in many respects from perfect\ncompetition, the natural rate of unemployment is likely to exceed the socially optimal\nunemployment rate. For example, with monopolistic competition, goods are underproduced\nbecause they are priced above marginal cost, so “potential output” is inefficiently low and\n“equilibrium unemployment” is too high.\nStandard macroeconomic analysis additionally assumes that inflation is determined by an\nexpectations-augmented, accelerationist Phillips curve of the form\n3 See among others Barro and Gordon (1983, pp. 592-3).\n\n3\n(2) π =πe − f(u −u*)+ε ,\nt t t t\nwhere πeis the expected inflation rate at time t (with expectations formed at t−1), and ε\nt t\ncaptures supply shocks to the Phillips curve at t. Reflecting the inflationary effects of tighter\nlabor markets, f ' is positive; reflecting the definition of u*, the natural rate of unemployment,\nas the rate of unemployment where actual and expected inflation match, f(0) is equal to zero.\nIn this formulation u* is the unique unemployment rate where inflation is stable. This Phillips\ncurve has the property that inflation rises (the price level accelerates) when u is below u*: since\nactual inflation exceeds expected inflation, with adaptive expectations, inflation expectations rise\nover time and are factored into wage and price setting. In contrast, when unemployment exceeds\nthe natural rate, actual inflation falls short of expected inflation, so inflation declines over time as\nexpectations adjust downward toward reality. With chronic high unemployment, deflation is\ninevitable.\nTo reach the conclusion that the gains from stabilizing output are trivially small, Lucas\nconsiders a representative agent with a stochastic consumption stream whose welfare is given by\nthe discounted sum of instantaneous utilities, which depend only on consumption and are\ncharacterized by constant relative risk aversion. Thus, welfare is\n⎧ ⎪ ∞ ⎛ 1 ⎞ t c1−γ ⎫ ⎪\n(3) E⎨ ∑ ⎜ ⎟ t ⎬ ,\n⎪⎩t=0\n⎝1+ρ⎠ 1−γ\n⎪⎭\nwhere γis the coefficient of relative risk aversion, andρ is the subjective discount rate.\nLucas shows that the gain from eliminating consumption volatility, measured as a\n1\nfraction of average consumption, is approximately γσ2, where σ2 is the variance of the log of\n2\nconsumption about its trend. For values of γcommonly used by researchers, the welfare gain\n\n4\nfrom eliminating consumption volatility of the magnitude experienced in the United States\nduring the postwar period would be minuscule—on the order of one-twentieth of a percent of\naverage consumption.4 This result is not surprising. With differentiable utility it takes large\nvariations in most variables to have significant effects on welfare, and the percentage variation in\nconsumption over the business cycle is now small.5\nLucas’s calculation of very low returns from further stabilization of output results from\nfour separate assumptions regarding the nature of the macroeconomic loss function (1) and the\nPhillips curve (2).6\nFirst, Lucas’s assessment of the potential gains from stabilizing consumption ignores\npossible relationships between the volatility of output and the volatility of inflation, captured in\nthe term bπ2 in the standard loss function. Policies to stabilize unemployment (and\nt\nconsumption) in the face of aggregate demand shocks simultaneously mitigate inflation volatility\naccording to (2), conferring welfare benefits beyond those assessed by Lucas.7 In contrast,\nstabilizing unemployment (and consumption) in the face of supply shocks entails a policy\ntradeoff between the volatility of inflation and unemployment (consumption). In this paper we\nfollow Lucas in ignoring the impacts of stabilization policy on inflation volatility.\n4 See Lucas (2003), p. 4. Lucas notes that values of γbetween 1 and 4 are commonly used in macroeconomics and\npublic finance applications. Lucas’s baseline calculation assumes σ = 0.032 and γ=1, corresponding to log utility.\n5 The losses also rise with the degree of risk aversion.\n6 Romer (2001) provides an excellent discussion of the assumptions underlying Lucas’s findings and the\nimplications of Lucas’s argument. In the tradition of modern macroeconomics textbooks, however, Romer fails to\nmention the possibility that the long-run Phillips curve may not always and everywhere be vertical, as emphasized in\nthis paper.\n7 Although it is commonly assumed, as in (1), that social welfare depends on both the mean and variance of\ninflation, the nature of the losses due to inflation volatility are not well understood. See Woodford (2002) for an\ninteresting discussion.\n\n5\nSecond, by considering paths of consumption that differ only in their volatility, Lucas\nimplicitly assumes that the Phillips curve is linear in unemployment. With a linear\naccelerationist Phillips curve, average unemployment is identical along all unemployment paths\nwith the same initial and final inflation. Assuming further that unemployment is just an index\nfor consumption and varies linearly with it, stabilization policy can affect the volatility of\nconsumption, but not its mean, as Lucas assumes.\nIf the short-run Phillips curve (the f( ) function in (2)) is nonlinear, however, paths of\nunemployment with the same beginning and ending inflation rate will differ somewhat in their\naverage unemployment rates. If f(u-u*) is concave, paths with lower unemployment volatility\nwill also enjoy lower average unemployment, higher average output, and higher average\nconsumption, contrary to Lucas’s assumption.\nLucas’s third assumption relates to the degree of nonlinearity of the function (1) relating\nsocial welfare to unemployment. The loss due to consumption volatility is trivially small in part\nbecause values of the rate of relative risk aversion Lucas considers plausible imply only very\nmodest curvature—thus, effective linearity—of the representative agent’s instantaneous utility\nfunction.8 However, significant nonlinearity with respect to unemployment in the social welfare\nfunction could reflect extreme losses in income for a small fraction of the population due to very\nlong spells of non-employment when unemployment is high, as well as substantially different\nvalues of leisure for the marginally employed person in booms and troughs.9\n8 Lucas notes that the losses due to consumption volatility are an order of magnitude higher using the far higher\nestimates of the degree of risk aversion needed to explain the equity premium puzzle. See, for example, Tallarini\n(2000), and Alvarez and Jermann (2000). However, as Lucas notes, not all volatility can be eliminated by\nstabilization policy, and not all risk aversion relates to business cycle fluctuations.\n9 Lucas’s use of the representative agent framework assumes in addition that households are identical and individual\nrisk is diversifiable.\n\n6\nFinally, Lucas’s calculation relies on the assumption that the Phillips curve is\naccelerationist so that expected inflation impacts current inflation with a coefficient of unity.\nSuch an assumption is now considered standard and is surprisingly well-accepted: if all wage and\nprice setters are rational, the coefficient on expected inflation “should be” one. However,\nassuming, even wishing, that wage setters and price setters are fully rational does not\nautomatically make it so. As we argue below, wage and price setters have their own ideas,\nwhich led Irving Fisher (1928) to deplore their lack of rationality. If the coefficient on expected\ninflation in wage or price equations is less than unity when inflation is low and unemployment is\nhigh, policies to combat unemployment will reduce average levels of unemployment.\nIn ensuing sections, we examine the sensitivity of Lucas’s conclusion to reasonable\nalterations in assumptions concerning the linearity of the loss function (1) and the nature of the\nPhillips curve (2). Section III examines possible reasons why near-linearity of the loss function\nmay be violated. Section IV examines the extent to which nonlinearity of the short-run Phillips\ncurve creates a meaningful role for stabilization policy. Finally, Section V examines the\npossibility that the accelerationist Phillips curve simply fails to fit the facts: it reviews evidence\nsuggesting that in long recessions, when inflation is low and unemployment is high, the Phillips\ncurve coefficient on expected inflation is considerably less than unity.\nIII. Nonlinearity in the Social Welfare Function\nWe have reviewed the logic behind Lucas’s finding that the losses from volatility in\nunemployment over the business cycle are likely to be small. There are several reasons why\nLucas’s calculation may overestimate these losses. However, these upside biases are probably\novershadowed by downward biases due to nonlinearity in the function relating welfare to\nunemployment.\n\n7\nModest as they are, there are two separate reasons why Lucas’s estimate of the potential\ngains from stabilization policy could still be too high. First, smoothing of output and\nemployment over the business cycle may not result in much additional consumption smoothing if\nconsumers follow the life-cycle hypothesis. If rational consumers already smooth consumption\nin response to transitory income shocks, a systematic policy to stabilize output might result in\nlittle additional consumption smoothing.\nAtkeson and Phelan (1994) have advanced a more subtle argument why welfare could be\nindependent of output volatility. A simple version of their argument supposes that consumers\nexperience only two states, employed and unemployed. When unemployed, individuals have\nlow consumption and low utility (U ); when employed, they enjoy high consumption and high\nL\nutility (U ). Expected utility is simply a weighted average of the high- and low-utility values, U\nH L\nand U , with the weights equal to the numbers of weeks spent employed and unemployed. In\nH\nthis formulation, stabilization of aggregate unemployment (or aggregate output) leaves welfare\nunchanged because aggregate utility depends only on the aggregate number of employment and\nunemployment weeks, numbers that should be totally unchanged by an alteration in the time\nprofile of aggregate unemployment that leaves mean unemployment unchanged. As Romer10\npoints out, Atkeson and Phelan’s argument provides a justification for linearity in the\nrelationship between social welfare and unemployment. An increase in the variance of\nunemployment in the Atkeson-Phelan model has the sole effect of increasing the correlation in\nunemployment risk across individuals. When unemployment is more variable, individuals are\nmore likely to be unemployed when others are also unemployed and to be employed when others\nare also employed. Neither source of overestimate matters much to Lucas’s assessment of the\nbenefits of stabilization policy since it is so very low to begin with.\n10 See Romer (2001), p. 495.\n\n8\nWe next turn to several reasons why welfare may depend nonlinearly on unemployment,\nsuggesting losses from output volatility that are higher than Lucas’s assessment. The first\npossibility is that the severity of an “unemployment” week rises (U falls), while the utility of an\nL\n“employment week” increases (U rises), as aggregate unemployment increases. Atkeson and\nH\nPhelan assume, in contrast, that the utility of an employment/unemployment week is independent\nof aggregate unemployment. But unemployment is arguably worse when it is higher and\nemployment arguably less beneficial when unemployment is low. If so, the benefits from\nstabilizing output could be far larger than Lucas estimates.\nOne reason that unemployment weeks may impose greater hardship during periods of\nhigh unemployment is that they disproportionately occur in unemployment spells of long\nduration. If a week of unemployment is worse when it is experienced as part of a longer spell,\nand the share of long-duration unemployment in total unemployment rises with the aggregate\nunemployment rate, then welfare declines nonlinearly, not linearly, as unemployment rises.\nWith higher unemployment, the average severity of unemployment weeks rises. Several recent\npapers suggest reasons why long-term unemployment may be especially bad. For example,\nChetty (2004) argues that long-duration unemployment is especially costly for those who have\nmade fixed financial commitments, for example, to buy a house. They may have to curtail\nconsumption drastically or give up such a commitment. Carroll (1992) has emphasized that the\nunemployed may have especially low incomes, which means that with unemployment of long\nduration they have to make especially deep cuts in consumption. Carroll finds a small, but\nnevertheless significant, fraction of his sample with very large cuts in annual income.11\n11 Imrohoğlu (1989), Krusell and Smith (2002) and Storesletten, Telmer and Yaron (2001) have used calibrated\nmodels to simulate the impact of a reduction in business cycle volatility under the assumption that consumers are\nunable to insure fully against idiosyncratic employment risk. The welfare costs of the business cycle, on average\nand for low-income, liquidity-constrained households, depend in part on the relationship between aggregate\n\n9\nTable 1 reports the results of our attempt to determine whether long-duration spells of\nunemployment rise disproportionately with aggregate unemployment for a sample of OECD\ncountries. The table reports (first-differenced) regressions relating the fraction of unemployment\noccurring in long spells of at least 6 months (or one year) to the aggregate unemployment rate.\nWe included all six countries in the OECD labor force statistics database with at least 20 years of\nannual data. In support of the “nonlinearity hypothesis,” the incidence of long-duration\nunemployment rises significantly with the aggregate unemployment rate for Australia, Canada,\nSweden, and the United States. The relationship is positive but insignificant for Japan and\nnonexistent for France.12\nThe obverse side of the Atkeson-Phelan argument is that the utility of employment may\ndiffer in good and bad times. In good times, with low unemployment, the marginal employee\nmay be close to indifferent between work and leisure—induced into the labor market by\novertime pay and extra perks. In contrast, the marginal employment opportunity in bad times\nmay yield a sizable welfare surplus, as firms draw from the pool of laborers those who are\nespecially anxious for a job. Following Ball and Romer (1990), Galí, Gertler, and López-Salido\nvolatility and individual employment and income volatility. Krusell and Smith find that low-income, liquidity-\nconstrained households would enjoy a gain equivalent to about a 4% increase in average consumption from the\nelimination of business cycle volatility. Their calculation assumes that a reduction in aggregate volatility also lowers\nindividual variability. Storesletten, Telmer, and Yaron find that idiosyncratic risk varies countercyclically,\namplifying the cost of aggregate volatility. They estimate average welfare gains from eliminating volatility\namounting to about 2.5% of consumption--an order of magnitude larger than Lucas.\n12 A large number of studies have documented the procyclical character of labor market outcomes, including\noutcomes for disadvantaged groups. See, for example, Hines, Hoynes, and Krueger (2001). We examined a variety\nof different labor market and socioeconomic indicators of “distress,” in addition to long-duration unemployment for\nthe United States, for evidence that outcomes vary more than linearly with unemployment. With the exception of\nmean family income at the 20th percentile of the income distribution, most measures, such as the poverty rate,\nmedian real family income, the Gini coeffiecient of income inequality, real hourly earnings, and average weekly\nhours, do not appear to vary nonlinearly with aggregate unemployment. Crime is also a measure of low welfare,\nwhich arguably might vary more than linearly over the business cycle. But Freeman (1994, pp. 8-12) finds only\nlukewarm evidence of a time series relation between unemployment and crime. Such a relation has been rendered\ndifficult to find because crime rates have also experienced very large shifts, both up and down, over time.\n\n10\n(2002) have formalized the preceding argument. In their model, the first-best level of\nemployment (and output) exceeds the economy’s steady-state employment (and output) level.\nDuring booms, the economy comes closer to the optimum, while in contractions, the economy\nmoves even further away. Marginal increases in employment thus result in decreasing gains.\nThe last hired are likely either to need the most enticement to be in the labor force, or,\nalternatively, they are likely to be the least productive. The function relating social welfare to\nemployment is nonlinear. Thus, the welfare cost of above-average unemployment during a\nbusiness-cycle downturn exceeds the welfare gain from a symmetric period of below-average\nunemployment during a business-cycle expansion. The net welfare loss from business cycle\nfluctuations is highly sensitive to the assumed elasticities of labor supply and demand. For\nplausible parameter values Galí et al. find that the welfare cost of the business cycle is an order\nof magnitude larger than Lucas estimates. For their preferred parameter values, the cost is\nestimated at about 1.35% of consumption.13\nTo summarize, evidence of nonlinear variation between long-duration unemployment\nspells and the aggregate unemployment rate suggests that weeks of unemployment are likely to\nbe more onerous in a trough than in a boom. Employment is correspondingly more beneficial in\na bust than in a boom. Estimates of the welfare losses from the business cycle due to this latter\neffect alone are an order of magnitude greater than Lucas’s estimate of the cost of business-cycle\nvolatility in consumption to representative-agent consumers. We are beginning to identify losses\nfrom business cycle volatility that, while not huge, are still not to be sneezed at.\nIt is worth mentioning another methodologically ingenious attempt to measure the loss in\nwelfare due to business cycle volatility using subjective satisfaction measures. Wolfers (2003)\nanalyzed responses from the Eurobarometer survey to the question “Taking things altogether, are\n13 See Galí, Gertler, and López-Salido (2002), p. 17.\n\n11\nyou very satisfied, fairly satisfied, not very satisfied, or not at all satisfied with the life you\nlead?” The survey covers 16 countries from 1973 to 1988. Wolfers regressed alternative\nmeasures of life satisfaction on a country’s average unemployment and inflation rates and the\nstandard deviations of unemployment and inflation during the previous eight years. He finds that\nunemployment volatility undermines well-being significantly. Wolfers also tested directly for\nnonlinearities in the relationship between life satisfaction and unemployment and inflation by the\ninclusion of quadratic terms, finding strong evidence of significant nonlinearity in the\nsatisfaction-unemployment relationship. However, the welfare benefits of reducing volatility are\nsubject to rapidly diminishing returns. Thus, eliminating the remaining unemployment volatility\nin Wolfers’s sample of countries would result in gains equivalent to only about a ¼ point\nreduction in the unemployment rate—large relative to Lucas’s estimate but much smaller than\nthe estimate of Galí et al. More research is needed to check the robustness of this clever\nmethodology.\nIV. Nonlinearity in the Phillips Curve\nIn the most standard form of the accelerationist Phillips curve, current inflation varies\nlinearly with unemployment. In terms of equation (2), the function f( ) is linear so that the\nPhillips curve takes the form\n(4) π =πe −β(u −u*)+ε.\nt t t t\nIn the United States, β is commonly estimated to be about ½, so, as a rule of thumb, a one\npercentage point rise in the unemployment rate, maintained for one year, decreases inflation by\nabout ½ percentage point.\n\n12\nThe assumption of linearity of the Phillips curve has implications for the desirability of\ncountercyclical policy. If the Phillips curve is convex, rather than linear, the change in inflation\nover any interval of time depends not only on average unemployment over the interval but also\non the volatility in unemployment. For paths characterized by constant expected inflation,\nconvexity yields an inverse relationship between the mean level of unemployment and the\nvolatility of unemployment. When unemployment is more stable, average unemployment can be\nat least somewhat smaller. With a convex short-run Phillips curve, stabilization policy may thus\nlower average unemployment.\nThe evidence in favor of nonlinearity of the Phillips curve is reasonably strong. Phillips\n1\n(1958), for example, chose an f( ) function of the form α+β to characterize data for Great\nu\nt\nBritain, not for theoretical reasons, but because it was most consistent with his plots of wage\ninflation and unemployment for the years 1861 to 1957. These graphs showed that as\nunemployment fell toward zero, inflation could reach very high levels; at times of high\nunemployment, wage inflation could become negative, but for the most part inflation “bottomed\nout” in the face of high unemployment. Lipsey’s follow-up paper (1960) provides a theoretical\nrationale for such nonlinearity. Lipsey argued that wage inflation would not be linear in the\nunemployment rate even if the rate of change in wages is linear in the gap between supply and\ndemand for labor. The reason is that the unemployment rate reflects the fraction of the labor\nforce searching for jobs, not the excess demand for labor; the relation between unemployment\nand wage inflation is inherently nonlinear because, as the excess demand for labor becomes very\nlarge, wage inflation would rise in proportion, but unemployment, which indexes the number of\n\n13\nworkers who are searching for jobs but do not find them, can only go to zero.14 Other possible\nreasons for nonlinearity of the Phillips curve include menu costs of changing prices,\nmisperceptions, and monopolistic competition (see Dupasquier and Ricketts (1998) for a survey).\nDownward rigidity of nominal wages is another potential cause of nonlinearity in the short-run\nPhillips curve. We discuss this topic at considerable length below, since nominal wage\nstickiness not only makes the f( ) function nonlinear but it may also reduce the coefficient on\nexpected inflation below unity, so that the Phillips curve is no longer accelerationist (see Tobin\n(1972), Fortin (1996), Akerlof, Dickens, and Perry (1996)).15\nLaxton, Rose, and Tambakis (1999) show that tests to discriminate among alternative\nfunctional forms of the Phillips curve suffer from extremely low power, making reliable\nassessment of the degree of convexity impossible. Even so, there is considerable evidence of\nnonlinearity. For example, Clark, Laxton, and Rose (1996) find strong evidence of nonlinearity\nfor the United States for 1964 to 1990. Laxton, Meredith, and Rose (1995) find evidence of\nnonlinearity using pooled G-7 data; and Mayes and Virén (2000) find nonlinearity for all EU\ncountries except Spain, the Netherlands, and Finland. Debelle and Laxton (1997) have taken the\nanalysis of nonlinearity one step further. For three countries, for the period 1971 to 1995, they\nhave estimated the difference between the average historical rate of unemployment and the\n“deterministic NAIRU,” defined as the level of the unemployment rate consistent with\nnonaccelerating inflation in the absence of shocks. These estimates are respectively 0.33\n14 See Lipsey (1960), p. 13. Lipsey also argues that, with such nonlinear relationships in each individual market, the\ndispersion of unemployment across markets will affect the level of wage change.\n15 Convexity of the short-run Phillips curve could reflect real, rather than nominal, wage rigidity. However, with\nreal, as opposed to nominal, wage rigidity, the coefficient on expected inflation should be unity, regardless of the\ninflation rate.\n\n14\npercentage points for the United States, 0.57 for the United Kingdom, and 0.86 for Canada.16\nThese estimates suggest that the volatility of output and unemployment has a nonnegligible\neffect on average unemployment (and output) via the nonlinearity of the short-run Phillips curve.\nA simple calculation confirms the reasonableness of Debelle and Laxton’s findings.\nSuppose we assume that π depends on 1/u, consistent with Phillips’s and Lipsey’s functional\nform for the Phillips curve. Taylor series expansion yields a formula that approximates the\ntradeoff between mean unemployment, u, and the volatility of unemployment, σ2, for a given\nu\ndeterministic NAIRU, u*.\nσ2\n(5) u =u*(1+ u )\n2\nu\nUsefully, this formula depends only on the functional form of the Phillips curve and is\nindependent of any estimated coefficient. Substituting the actual mean and standard deviation\nof U.S. unemployment for the period 1971-1995 for u andσ in (4), we estimate that the\nu\nvolatility in unemployment raised average unemployment by 0.23 percentage points, a result that\nis similar in magnitude to Debelle and Laxton’s estimate of 0.33 using an entirely different\nmethodology based on a parametrically estimated Phillips curve.\nSuch estimates surely overstate the decline in average unemployment due to nonlinearity\nthat could result from further improvements in stabilization policy. As Lucas notes, it is\nunrealistic to think that stabilization policy has the potential to eliminate all variability in\nunemployment. However, the volatility of output and unemployment in the United States and\nnumerous European countries has declined considerably since the 1980s—a phenomenon that\nhas been dubbed the Great Moderation. The formula (4) can also be used to estimate the\n16 See Debelle and Laxton (1997), p. 260.\n\n15\nreduction in average unemployment resulting from the great moderation in the U.S. Following\nStock and Watson (2003), we date the great moderation at 1984. The standard deviation of U.S.\nunemployment declined from 1.74 to 1.07 between the periods 1960-1983 and 1984-2003,\nrespectively. Our formula suggests that the reduction in mean unemployment due to this\nreduction in volatility amounted to a nontrivial 0.31. Of course, it is debatable just how much of\nthis payoff was due to stabilization policy. Stock and Watson attribute a substantial portion of\nthe moderation to smaller shocks, that is, “good luck.” In the view of some observers (Romer\n(1999), Bernanke (2004)), however, monetary policy probably deserves significant credit.\nIn summary, the nonlinearity of the Phillips curve implies that successful stabilization\npolicy reduces average unemployment. These gains are not huge, but, then again, neither are\nthey so very small.\nV. Is the Accelerationist Hypothesis Always Valid?\nThe accelerationist Phillips curve depicts cyclical downturns and expansions as times\nwhen society stashes money in the bank and then draws its balance down. During a cyclical\ndownturn, inflation falls, and with it, inflationary expectations; lower inflationary expectations\nimply lower inflation at any unemployment rate in the future. High unemployment during a\ndownturn is thus an “investment” which permits lower unemployment in the future, for any\ngiven long-run inflation target. Indeed, with both an accelerationist and linear Phillips curve,\nthe investment pays a zero rate of return, since the tradeoff between unemployment in present\nand future periods is exactly one-for-one: one extra point of unemployment now permits exactly\none less point of unemployment later. Section IV showed that this tradeoff is not quite one-for-\none if the short-run Phillips curve is nonlinear, even if it is accelerationist. Section III argued\n\n16\nthat, even with a tradeoff between unemployment now and unemployment later that is one- for-\none, social welfare may be higher with a smoother path of unemployment over time.\nBut it is also possible that the Phillips curve is not accelerationist. There may not always\nand everywhere be a one-for-one add-on to current inflation as inflationary expectations rise. If\nthe add-on is less than unity, an economic downturn metaphorically puts money in the bank by\nlowering inflationary expectations and future inflation, but the return on the investment is\nnegative. In this case, an extra point of unemployment now reduces unemployment later by less\nthan a point—a negative return. If the accelerationist hypothesis is violated—which we consider\nespecially likely when inflation is initially low—the returns to stabilization policy may be quite\nhigh.\nIndeed, the most persuasive critique of Lucas’s case against stabilization policy comes if\nthe accelerationist hypothesis is violated. In this section, we question the validity of the\naccelerationist hypothesis and present evidence suggesting that monetary policy can combat high\nunemployment at low initial inflation rates without curtailing the opportunity for low\nunemployment in later periods. In the words of DeLong and Summers:17 “…successful\nmacroeconomic policies fill in troughs without shaving off peaks.” If so, active stabilization\npolicy—the use of monetary policy both to combat recession and aggressively contain\ninflation—will reduce average unemployment and raise average output. In support of this view,\nwe review cross-country evidence from the Great Depression and from the downturns afflicting a\nnumber of countries during the 1990s. This evidence suggests that once inflation is low,\ninflation decelerates by much less in the face of high unemployment than is consistent with the\naccelerationist thesis. If the failure to combat a prolonged recession does little to reduce inflation\nwhen it is already low, it creates little opportunity for a future, offsetting boom.\n17 DeLong and Summers (1988), p. 434.\n\n17\nTheory. Empirical research on the Phillips curve usually imposes the restriction that the\nimpact of expected on actual inflation is point-for-point. This restriction guarantees that the\nlong-run equilibrium level of unemployment is independent of the rate of inflation: the long-run\nPhillips curve is vertical. Such an assumption seems reasonable if firms and workers are\nrational, in the sense that they base their decisions on real, not nominal, wages and relative\nprices, and inflation expectations ultimately mirror reality.\nHowever reasonable, the assumption that individual behavior depends on real, not\nnominal, magnitudes, is just that—an assumption. Modelers routinely adopt this hypothesis not\nbecause the evidence in its favor is overwhelming, but rather because it is theoretically “correct”\nfor rational agents to assess price and wage bargains in real terms.\nBut, not everyone involved in price and wage setting may always think like an economist.\nIf so, there is the possibility that the parameters of the Phillips curve vary depending upon\ncircumstances. For example, individuals might take inflationary expectations fully into account,\neven incorporating COLAs in contracts, when inflation is high enough to be salient, but not\nwhen inflation is low. Under some conditions, people may suffer from money illusion. Some\nemployees may consider nominal wage cuts insulting or unfair, so that money wages may be\nsticky downwards. If so, the degree of downward real wage rigidity rises as inflation declines,\nand the sacrifice ratio rises.\nWhile macroeconomic textbooks now all but universally assume an accelerationist\nPhillips curve, the basis for such a claim is surprisingly shaky.18 Textbooks commonly point to\nthe shifts that undoubtedly occurred in the Phillips curve as U.S. inflation rose in the 1960s and\nearly 1970s as evidence of the accelerationist prediction that higher inflation raises inflationary\n18 Fortin, Akerlof, Dickens, and Perry provide an excellent survey (2002).\n\n18\nexpectations, shifting the short-run Phillips curve upward. Such behavior is “rational” so it\nseems logical to assume that it is universal. However, when inflation is low and less salient, and\nwage setters are preoccupied with other problems, such as low sales, job loss, and the necessity\nof layoffs, they may approach wage and price decisions with a different mental frame than\neconomists. In these circumstances, the short-run Phillips curve may shift by less than one-for-\none with expected inflation.19 Summarizing the macroeconomic evidence for a vertical long-run\nPhillips curve, Mankiw (2001) thus concludes that “…if one does not approach the data with a\nprior favoring long-run neutrality, one would not leave the data with that posterior. The data’s\nbest guess is that monetary shocks leave permanent scars on the economy.”20\nThe basic theoretical premise underlying the accelerationist Phillips curve is that the\npublic and economists think about inflation in the same way. Yet in surveys taken by Robert\nShiller (1997), economists and the public indicated that they approach inflation with a very\ndifferent mental frame, responding quite differently to a battery of questions concerning\ninflation. The responses to two of Shiller’s questions provide examples of the extent to which\neconomists’ views of inflation differ from those of the general public. Most economists (90\npercent) disagree with the statement: “I think that if my pay went up I would feel more\nsatisfaction in my job, more sense of fulfillment, even if prices went up just as much.” Seventy-\nseven percent of economists completely disagree with the statement and none fully agree. In\ncontrast, less than half (44 percent) of the public disagrees with the statement. While only 27\npercent completely disagree, more than a quarter (28 percent) express full agreement (Shiller\n19 The implications of downward nominal wage rigidity for the shape of the long-run Phillips curve have been\nexplored by Tobin (1972) and Akerlof, Dickens, and Perry (1996). Karanassou, Sala, and Snower (2003) show that\na significant long-run tradeoff can arise due to the interaction between time discounting and time-contingent\nnominal contracts even if all agents are rational and lack money illusion and there are no permanent nominal\nrigidities.\n20 Mankiw (2001), p. c48.\n\n19\n(1997, p. 37)). Responses to another question provide further evidence of the distance between\neconomists’ and the public’s respective mental frames concerning inflation: Forty-nine percent\nof economists answered that their “biggest gripe about inflation” was that it “causes a lot of\ninconvenience,” and only 12 percent that it “hurt their real buying power.” The public’s answers\nwere massively reversed: only 7 percent named “inconvenience” as their “biggest gripe,” while a\nfull 77 percent named their loss of “buying power” (Shiller, 1997, p. 29). Shafir, Diamond, and\nTversky (1997) similarly document substantial money illusion in survey responses. They\nattribute pervasive money illusion to individuals’ psychological propensity to rely\nsimultaneously on real and nominal mental frames for evaluation purposes. Partial reliance on a\nnominal frame reflects the “ease, universality, and salience of the nominal representation.”21\nSuch survey findings do not falsify the accelerationist hypothesis. But they raise the\nquestion why, with so little examination, macroeconomists have assumed that the Phillips curve\nof necessity must take the accelerationist form. They suggest instead that the validity of the\naccelerationist Phillips curve must be an empirical question.\nIn addition to survey evidence of money illusion, there is considerable microeconomic\nevidence that firms are reluctant to impose wage cuts on workers except in times of unusual\nduress for the firm. Bewley (1999) interviewed employers in Connecticut who said they would\nnot cut money wages for fear of harming morale, except in exceptional situations where the\nsurvival of the firm was at stake. Similarly, surveys by Blinder and Choi (1990) and by\nCampbell and Kamlani (1997) report a strong negative relationship between work morale and\nwage cuts. There is also much evidence--from papers using respectively different\nmethodologies, samples, and countries--that wage changes pile up near zero when inflation is\n21 Shafir, Diamond, and Tversky (1997), p. 348. Experimental evidence by Fehr and Tyran (2001) also shows the\nexistence of money illusion.\n\n20\nlow. Such evidence has been reported by Card and Hyslop (1997), Kahn (1997), Lebow, Saks\nand Wilson (1999), and Altonji and Devereux (1999) for the United States, by Fortin (1996) for\nCanada, by Cassino (1995) and Chapple (1996) for New Zealand, by Dwyer and Leong (2000)\nfor Australia, by Castellanos et al. (2004) for Mexico, by Kuroda and Yamamoto (2003a, 2003b,\n2003c) and Kimura and Ueda (2001) for Japan, by Fehr and Goette (2003) for Switzerland, by\nBauer et al. (2003) and Knoppik and Beissinger (2003) for Germany, by Nickell and Quintini\n(2001) for the United Kingdom, and by Agell and Lundborg (2003) for Sweden.\nDownward nominal wage rigidity causes the accelerationist property of the Phillips curve\nto break down at sufficiently low inflation rates. As inflation falls, the constraint on wage cuts\nimpinges on increasing numbers of firms and employees.22 The apparent ubiquity of downward\nnominal wage rigidity strongly suggests that the effect of expected inflation on wage and price\nbargains could become muted in times of sufficiently low inflation. But, of course, the fact that\nwages sometimes do actually fall--as in the Great Depression when they fell a great deal--\nsuggests that wage rigidity is not absolute. The behavior of wages in the Great Depression is\nconsistent with Bewley’s finding that, in the downturn in Connecticut in the early 1990s, firms\nresisted wage cuts, but wages did give way in the presence of sufficient “financial distress.”\nFinancial distress made workers far more accepting of wage cuts. 23\nMacro Evidence. We next examine cross-country macroeconomic data on the behavior\nof inflation in situations characterized by prolonged, abnormally high unemployment. In our\nview, the evidence from such episodes is grossly inconsistent with the traditional accelerationist\n22 The accelerationist property begins to break down as the average rate of money wage change approaches zero.\nThe inflation rate at which this occurs declines point-for-point with the rate of productivity growth.\n23\nSee Bewley (1999), pp. 201-208.\n\n21\nhypothesis enshrined in modern macroeconomics textbooks. According to that view, expected\ninflation feeds through point-for-point into actual inflation regardless of the initial level of\ninflation, and inflationary expectations are formed as an extrapolation (via a distributed lag) of\nrecent inflation experience. With a traditional Phillips curve, low unemployment drives actual\ninflation above expected inflation. With actual inflation continually in excess of expected\ninflation, expected inflation must, in due course rise. Since expected inflation is passed through\ninto actual inflation one-for-one, actual inflation must also rise, so, over time, the price level\naccelerates. Conversely, high unemployment causes inflation to fall short of expectations,\nproducing ever lower inflation—i.e., accelerating deflation. We shall see that most data from\nlong economic downturns are inconsistent with such a model of wage, price, and expectations\nbehavior.\nThere is an alternative interpretation of the behavior of inflation during the long\ndownturns we examine that is consistent with the accelerationist Phillips curve: inflation\nexpectations might not have been adaptive, reflecting an extrapolation of past inflation behavior.\nInstead, wage and price setters might have expected inflation (or the price level) to revert toward\n“normal,” explaining why inflation could remain stable or even rise in spite of substantial labor\nmarket slack. This more sophisticated hypothesis is difficult to assay convincingly, but we shall\noffer some shreds of evidence suggesting that incomplete pass-through is a more plausible\ninterpretation of wage and price behavior in long downturns. An interesting issue for future\nresearch is to devise a test using macroeconomic data to identify the extent of inflation pass-\nthrough in depressions, while allowing for the possibility of non-adaptive inflationary\nexpectations.\n\n22\nWe begin by considering a model in which inflationary expectations are adaptive. In\nperiods in which economic activity is depressed for a prolonged period, so that the\nunemployment rate is consistently above NAIRU, the systematic part of the driving force of the\ninflation process, which is −f(u −u*) in equation (2), is always negative. As a result, if\nt\ninflationary expectations are formed adaptively, as in standard non-rational expectations models,\ninflation will spiral downwards.\nThis proposition is straightforward to show under simple assumptions and can also be\ngeneralized. Suppose that the Phillips curve is of the standard accelerationist form assumed in\n(2):\n(6) π =πe − f(u −u*)+ε\nt t t t\nSuppose also, for simplicity, that expected inflation is inflation in the previous period.\n(7) πe =π .\nt t−1\nThen mere addition shows that the expected cumulative change in inflation from the beginning\nof a “depression”--a prolonged period of high unemployment--which we label time 0, to any\nlater date n is the sum:\nn\n(8) E[π −π]=∑[f(u −u*)].\nn 0 t\nt=1\nEquation (8) shows that in a “depression,” where u significantly exceeds u* for an\nt\nextended time, the expected value of the change in inflation is negative for all n (and all possible\ninitial dates, 0). The expected value of the cumulative change in inflation becomes increasingly\nnegative as n increases. The cumulative change in inflation also declines as n increases at a rate\nat least as large as f(u - u*), where u is the minimum unemployment rate during the n\nmin min\nperiods. Graphically, with an accelerationist Phillips curve, the expectation of the cumulative\n\n23\nchange in inflation should lie in the shaded area in Figure 1. The slope of the ray in Figure 1 is\nf(u - u*). This, of course, is the flip side of the accelerationist argument: with an\nmin\naccelerationist Phillips curve and adaptive expectations, low unemployment is expected to\nproduce accelerating inflation. But in a depression, the opposite occurs; high unemployment\nshould produce decelerating inflation, ultimately deflation. An accelerationist Phillips curve in\na boom is a decelerationist Phillips curve in a depression.\nOf course, the expectations process assumed in (7) lacks generality even with only\nadaptive expectations: it should be extended to the case in which expectations are a k-period,\nrather than a 1-period distributed lag of past inflation. In this case, the expectation of a k-period\ndistributed lag of n-period changes in inflation is ever-decreasing in n during periods in which\nthe unemployment rate is continually in excess of the natural rate.24\nAccelerating Deflation in the Great Depression? Our theorem suggests that a natural\nway to test the generality of the adaptive-expectations accelerationist hypothesis is to examine\ndata on inflation during periods with prolonged high unemployment. We begin with a look at\nthe Great Depression, a period in which, partly due to linkages of countries through the gold\nstandard,25 unemployment rates rose in almost all countries around the globe and remained\n24\nFor example, with two periods, with weights a and 1-a on periods one and two respectively, the formula\nbecomes:\n1 1−a 1 n\nE[ (π −π)+ (π −π )]= ∑[f(u −u*)].\n2−a n 0 2−a n−1 −1 2−a t\nt=1\nIn the more general case of a k-period distributed lag the formula becomes:\nk\n(∑ a )\nk−1 1 n k i k−1\nE[∑A (π −π)]= ∑[f(u −u*)] where B=∑ia , A = i=j+1 , ∑A =1, and expectations\nj n−j j B t i j B j\nj=0 t=1 i=1 j=0\nk\nare formed by the process π t = ∑aπ t-i.\ni\ni=1\n25 See Eichengreen (1992).\n\n24\nconsiderably above their respective natural rates for almost a decade. Unemployment has never\nbeen anywhere near so high in any of the countries we consider either before or since, so it is\nclear that such joblessness could not be a simple aberration due to time-varying changes in the\nnatural rate. Appeal to time-varying NAIRU has been used to explain apparent violations of the\nnatural rate hypothesis in other periods, but such an appeal cannot apply for the 1930s when the\nrates of unemployment were so extraordinarily high.\nFigure 2 summarizes evidence on the evolution of inflation during the Great Depression\nfor twelve countries. The solid line in each graph plots the annual inflation rate (the change in\nthe CPI) for periods characterized by exceptionally high unemployment. The bars show the\ncumulative (n-period) change in the rate of inflation from a starting date (1930 or 1931) near the\nbeginning of the depression.\nThe data reveal no evidence whatever in any country of declining inflation, even under\nconditions of massive unemployment. Every country other than Denmark experienced deflation\nfor a period at the outset of the 1930s. The common pattern is one of rising inflation over time\nwith positive inflation after 1933 or 1934. The absence of a pattern of declining inflation\nappears to hold robustly, independent of start date.\nNo f( ) function, no matter how nonlinear, can explain why inflation declined so very\nlittle or not at all during the latter part of the 1930s if inflationary expectations are formed as a\ndistributive lag of past inflations. Unless there were massive shifts in the Phillips curve during\nthis period, the data suggest that the coefficient on inflationary expectations was less than unity\nduring the later part of the Depression. Of course, those who believe that wages or prices might\nbe sticky would not find such a conclusion surprising. But such a conclusion is contrary to the\nmicrofoundations of the modern Phillips curve with adaptive expectations.\n\n25\nA potential criticism of our interpretation of these data is that eight or nine years is too\nshort a period in which to expect accelerating deflation to materialize in the presence of long lags\nand stochastic shocks. The period of the 1930s was also unique for other special reasons, such\nas the United States’ attempt to reflate through the National Recovery Act and its legislation to\nencourage unionization, which could mask a longer-term trend toward decelerating inflation.26\nHowever, evidence for three countries (the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Sweden)\nreveals no pattern of decelerating inflation even after 17 years of high unemployment. These\ncountries suffered from high unemployment continuously after 1921 because the Great\nDepression of the 1930s struck before they had fully recovered from the downturn of the 1920s.\nFigure 3 shows the behavior of annual and cumulative inflation after 1922. In each country, we\nsee a period of deflation following the onset of both downturns, but no tendency toward the\ncumulative and accelerating decline in inflation predicted by the accelerationist hypothesis with\nadaptive expectations. Gordon and Wilcox (1981) have suggested that the data from the\nDepression roughly conform to a model in which inflation depends not on the level of the output\ngap but rather on the change in the output gap (or unemployment.) Such a model seems to\ncharacterize the data in Figures 2 and 3.\nDecelerating Inflation during the Downturns of the 1990s? Because the Great Depression\nis so special, it is useful to look for corroborative evidence from later periods. Figure 4 presents\ndata on the behavior of inflation for a number of OECD countries that experienced periods of\nprolonged unemployment in excess of their respectively estimated NAIRUs during the 1990s.\nThe figure relies on OECD data and covers periods in which unemployment exceeded OECD\n26 Bernanke (1995) notes that governments also intervened to prevent deflation in other countries, such as France.\n\n26\nestimates of the NAIRU. 27 These recessions occurred in normal times, in the absence of an\ninternational gold standard. Most of the countries operated under a flexible exchange rate\nregime.28 The solid line shows the annual rate of inflation in the core CPI, while the bars again\ngive the cumulative (n-period) change in inflation from an initial period in which unemployment\nexceeds NAIRU.\nThe behavior of inflation, as measured by the change in the core CPI since the beginning of\nthe respective downturn, is again largely inconsistent with the adaptive expectations\naccelerationist hypothesis. Two countries—France and Sweden—exhibit a pattern of almost\nmonotonically declining inflation and cumulatively declining n-period inflation, consistent with\nthe accelerationist hypothesis. In Japan, also consistent with the accelerationist theory, inflation\ndid decline reasonably consistently after 1994. Japan is the only country in which inflation\nactually turned negative.29 However, deflation has not significantly intensified in Japan, in\ncontradiction to the accelerationist hypothesis. The remaining countries provide no evidence of\nconsistently declining inflation in the face of high unemployment. Instead, consistent with the\nhypothesis of downward nominal wage rigidity resulting in a failure of inflation to reflect\nchanges in inflationary expectations on a one-for-one basis, the graphs (e.g., Canada, Finland,\nSwitzerland) suggest a tendency for inflation to stabilize in the face of high unemployment once\ninflation has declined to a low positive level.\nThe data in Figure 5 support the interpretation that downward nominal wage rigidity is to\nblame for the breakdown of the adaptive-expectations accelerationist hypothesis. Figure 5\n27 See OECD (2003, p. 31) for recent NAIRU estimates and Richardson et al. (2000).\n28 Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden and Switzerland had freely floating exchange rates throughout\nthe period. France was a member of the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) of the European Monetary System.\nFinland joined the ERM in October 1996.\n29 The uptick in inflation in Japan in 1997 reflects an increase in the consumption tax.\n\n27\npresents data on various measures of wage inflation during the 1990s recessions for those\ncountries for which the OECD maintains a wage series. In the basic Phillips curve relationship,\nthe one-for-one pass-through of expected inflation into actual inflation works via wage\nbargaining. Patterns of wage inflation provide a cleaner test for one-for-one pass-through than\npatterns pertaining to price inflation, which depend on productivity developments and other\nsupply factors, in addition to wages. Figure 5 reveals no consistent tendency for wage inflation\nto decelerate in the face of excess unemployment. The general pattern instead is for average\nwage changes to remain positive, roughly stabilizing at a low level. The only country in which\nwages are observed to decline is Japan, where bonuses enhance downward wage flexibility.\nOther analysts have similarly rejected the accelerationist model based on tests using time-\nseries data. Fair (2000) strongly rejects the accelerationist model for U.S. data by testing\nrestrictions that the accelerationist hypothesis places on inflation dynamics. Estimating the\nPhillips curve (in first difference form) Fair finds that changes in inflation depend on the lagged\nprice level. This suggests some form of money illusion: as if the current level of prices (and/or\nwages) puts a damper on the extent to which high unemployment will cause a reduction in\ninflation.30 We have employed a slightly different strategy with a similar finding. King and\nWatson (1994) present evidence of a long-run tradeoff between unemployment and inflation,\nalthough they also find this tradeoff to be greater earlier than later in the late postwar period.31\nLundborg and Sacklén (2001) estimate a nonvertical long-run Phillips curve for Sweden.\nBrainard and Perry (2000) find that the coefficient on expected inflation in the Phillips curve\nvaries inversely with inflation.\n30 Fair (2000) p. 70.\n31 King and Watson (1994), p. 163.\n\n28\nThe evidence strongly suggests that at times of low inflation and high unemployment, the\ncoefficient on expected inflation in wage and price equations is less than unity as long as\ninflationary expectations are adaptively formed. In this case, there is a long-run tradeoff between\ninflation and unemployment at low inflation rates.\nOur reading of these pictures is in agreement with the judgment of others who have\nexamined inflation data for the same period. For example, in a recent assessment of inflation\npersistence in the euro area, the OECD concluded that “…it appears to be a generalized\nphenomenon that inflation has risen in countries with positive cumulative output gaps but has not\nfallen in those with negative cumulative gaps. This feature of the data could reflect the presence\nof nominal rigidities that are hampering inflation adjustment in countries where activity is\nweak.” 32\nAn Alternative Interpretation of the Data. While Figures 2 to 5 suggest that an\naccelerationist Phillips curve with adaptive expectations cannot explain inflation either during\nthe Great Depression or during some prolonged downturns in the 1990s, there is another possible\ninterpretation of the data.33 Conceivably, inflation expectations during the Depression and these\nmore recent long recessions reflect the view that the level of prices (and/or inflation) would\neventually return to “normal.” Since the absolute price level took a downward dive in the early\n1930s in virtually all countries, expected inflation could have been positive, rather than negative,\nthereafter.\nWe should note, at least parenthetically, that such regressive expectations concerning the\nprice level would not be rational for countries operating under the gold standard. The adjustment\n32 OECD Economic Outlook 72, 2002, p. 163.\n33 Sargent (1971) long ago pointed out that the appropriate identifying restriction on the sum of coefficients on\nlagged inflation in the traditional Phillips curve should depend on the process by which inflation (and inflation\nexpectations) was actually generated during the particular period being studied.\n\n29\nto a negative aggregate demand shock in the gold-standard countries required a decline in prices\nand wages until full employment had been restored. With massive unemployment, the price\nlevel should have been expected to fall yet further. But, one by one, countries were going off the\ngold standard in the 1930s, and the argument does make sense once governments have the scope\nto expand the money supply and reflate.34 Regressive (or forward-looking) inflationary\nexpectations might also account for the poor showing of the adaptive-expectations accelerationist\nPhillips curve during the long downturns of the 1990s, especially since by 1993, Australia,\nCanada, Finland, New Zealand, and Sweden had all adopted explicit inflation targets, which\nmight have anchored inflationary expectations. The question thus remains whether, during the\ndownturns we have examined, the failure of inflation to decline after reaching a low level reflects\nregressive expectations or, instead, the use of a nominal, rather than a real frame for setting\nprices and wages.\nAlthough a method might conceivably be developed to distinguish among these\nalternative interpretations based on macroeconomic data, our conjecture is that econometric tests\nusing only data on wages and prices have very little power to discriminate between the two\nhypotheses. This suggests that supplementary microeconomic information and independent,\nsurvey-based measures of inflationary expectations would be useful in settling the question.\nWhat evidence we do have from these two different types of sources, however, favors the\nhypothesis that once inflation is low, downward nominal wage rigidity mutes and truncates the\npass-through of inflationary expectations. We have already cited considerable evidence\nsuggesting the existence of downward nominal wage rigidity generally. In addition, O’Brien\n34 France and Italy remained on the gold standard until 1936; Belgium and Switzerland remained until 1935. The\nUnited States left the gold standard in 1933; Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom\nleft the gold standard in 1931; Australia broke with gold in 1929.\n\n30\n(1989) and Hanes (2000) find that downward nominal wage rigidity was especially pervasive\nduring the Great Depression, thus explaining our findings in Figures 2 and 3.\nAn alternative strategy to discern the difference between regressive expectations and\nincomplete pass-through relies on independent measures of inflationary expectations. Akerlof,\nDickens, and Perry (2000) estimated Phillips curves with survey measures of inflation\nexpectations, rather than lagged inflation. Consistent with our interpretation of the data, they\nfind that the coefficient on expectations is close to unity when unemployment is low, but close to\nzero when unemployment is high. This suggests incomplete pass-through rather than regressive\nexpectations. Although these findings are suggestive, they cannot be taken as conclusive. In the\ncase of downward nominal wage rigidity, there is no definitive way to go from the micro\nfindings to the macroeconomic consequences. And, the low pass-through coefficient estimated\nby Akerlof, Dickens, and Perry could be the result of high measurement error of inflationary\nexpectations when inflation is low.\nVI. Conclusion\nBoth output stabilization and maintenance of price stability have been important policy\npriorities during the postwar period. These dual policy goals are enshrined in the Federal\nReserve Act and are widely accepted by both policymakers and the public as sensible and\nappropriate. The decline in volatility of output and employment since the mid 1980s suggests\nthat the Fed’s efforts have met with some success. In his Presidential address to the American\nEconomic Association, however, Robert Lucas argued that stabilization of output, even if\npossible, should not be a macroeconomic priority because the gains are trivially small.\nAccording to Lucas’s argument, stabilization policy has no impact on average consumption. It\n\n31\nmerely alters the timing of consumption, a variable whose aggregate fluctuations have been\nextremely modest. Lucas’s argument rests on assumptions concerning the determinants of social\nwelfare and the characteristics of the Phillips curve that are broadly endorsed by professional\nmacroeconomists and incorporated in most macroeconomics textbooks. Given the strong\ngrounding of Lucas’s conclusion in standard theory, our objective has been to reconsider the\neconomic logic of stabilization policy.\nThis paper surveyed a growing literature questioning key assumptions underlying Lucas’s\nconclusion. Based on this survey and our own suggestive evidence, we conclude that there is a\nsolid case for stabilization policy and that there are especially strong reasons for central banks to\naccord it priority in the current era of low inflation. The evidence suggests that stabilization\npolicy can produce non-negligible gains in welfare. With a nonlinear short-run Phillips curve,\nstabilization policy reduces average levels of joblessness and raises average output by a\nnontrivial amount. Stabilization policy also raises social welfare if, as seems likely, welfare\ndeteriorates nonlinearly with increases in unemployment. A nonlinear relationship between\nunemployment and social welfare may reflect the increasing incidence of long-duration\nunemployment spells as aggregate unemployment rises, the diminishing benefits associated with\nadditional job creation as unemployment falls, or correlations between idiosyncratic risks and\naggregate risks that result in large losses for low-income, liquidity-constrained households as a\nresult of the business cycle.\nA Phillips curve that is not always accelerationist provides a further, important reason for\ncentral banks to pursue stabilization as an objective. The now-traditional accelerationist Phillips\ncurve captures two elementary truths about the nature of inflation. First, when product and labor\nmarkets are tight, as typically occurs when unemployment is low, prices and wages both tend to\n\n32\nincrease. This corresponds to the simplest notion of supply and demand: if unemployment is\nsufficiently low, the demand for labor exceeds supply, and it would be highly surprising if wages\ndid not rise to close the gap. Higher inflationary expectations should similarly raise labor\ndemand and reduce labor supply, pushing wage and price inflation higher.\nBut the accelerationist Phillips curve is much more specific and goes further, stating that\nthe impact of inflationary expectations on inflation is exactly point-for-point at all times and in\nall phases of the business cycle. Such a conclusion would be justified theoretically if all parties\naffected by wage and price decisions thought exactly like economists. But the assumption that\neverybody in the economy thinks about prices and wages in the same real terms as economists is\na strong one, and available research we have reviewed suggests that under many circumstances\nthis assumption is violated. The most solid evidence of a violation comes from considerable\ncross-country evidence revealing a spike in the distribution of money wage changes at zero, with\nthe spike becoming larger as inflation declines. Questionnaires similarly suggest that economists\nand the public do not answer questions about inflation in the same way. We also argue that the\nbehavior of inflation during long periods with extensive labor market slack, such as the Great\nDepression and the downturns afflicting numerous countries during the 1990s, appears\ninconsistent with the accelerationist hypothesis. The macroeconomic evidence instead suggests a\ndiminished tendency for inflation to decline in the face of high unemployment—that is, a higher\nsacrifice ratio—due to lower pass-through of inflationary expectations into inflation once\ninflation is already low, as it now is throughout the industrialized world. This violation of the\naccelerationist hypothesis is a logical consequence of downward nominal wage rigidity.\nSince the gains from stabilization policy depend largely on the nature of the inflation\nprocess—whether it is linear or nonlinear and whether it is accelerationist or not—we suggest\n\n33\npolicymakers should be cautious about embracing inflation forecasts derived from theoretical\nmodels embodying overly strong priors. A cautious approach is also dictated by the fact that the\nfit of the Phillips curve for many countries and time periods is extremely loose.35 Such a poor fit\nof accelerationist Phillips curves, even allowing for a time-varying NAIRU, strengthens the case\nfor forecasts of inflation that are independent of natural rate theory and policy strategies that\nexplicitly recognize the uncertainty attached to these forecasts. Indeed, the success of the\nFederal Reserve in the late 1990s in reducing unemployment and inflation simultaneously was\narguably a consequence both of the Fed’s commitment to dual policy goals and its empirically\noriented and open-minded approach toward forecasting inflation.\n35 See Staiger, Stock, and Watson (1997).\n\n34\nReferences\nAgell, Jonas and Per Lundborg, “Survey Evidence on Wage Rigidity and Unemployment:\nSweden in the 1990s,” Scandinavian Journal of Economics, 105:1 (March, 2003) pp. 15-29.\nAkerlof, George A., William T.

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nWomen’s History Month Reception\nU.S. Capitol\nWashington D.C.\nMarch 25, 2014\n\n-2-\nIt’s an honor and a pleasure for me to be here with you to mark Women’s History Month,\nwhich itself has some history behind it.\nMarch 8, 1911 was the first International Women’s Day, and it was 1980 when President\nCarter established National Women’s History Week. In 1987, Congress acted to make that week\na full month.\nWomen, of course, are also a part of history for the other 11 months of the year. And I\nwould add that women were influencing the course of history long before 1980, or 1911. But I\nam glad that there is, each year, a time when we pause to think about the role of women, because\nhistory is more than simply what happened, and more than what women and men did to make it\nhappen.\nHistory is what we remember about those deeds. It is the lessons we have taken from the\npast and the knowledge we draw on to live today and to shape the future.\nFor me, one lesson from history is that it is no coincidence that America’s great success\nin the past century came as women steadily increased their participation in every aspect of\nsociety. Starting with gaining the vote, just a few years before International Women’s Day, “The\nAmerican Century,” as it’s sometimes known, was also a century of progress for women.\nFundamental to our country’s values, to those ideals that have been and continue to be so\ninfluential around the world, is the principle of equality for all, including for women.\nOne reason America’s example is influential elsewhere is because progress toward these\nideals has been accompanied by great success in broadly raising living standards. And I think\nour economic success has been due in substantial part to the fuller participation and contribution\nof women to the economy. Their increasing participation in the workforce, particularly after\n\n-3-\n1970, was a major factor in sustaining growing family incomes. Making fuller use of the talents\nand efforts of women in the workplace has made us more productive and prosperous.\nIf I were to apply this lesson, I would hope that our nation continues to reap the benefits\nof greater participation by women in the economy and that we do everything that we can to\nfoster that participation. Women have made great progress in many occupations and professions,\nbut lag in others. In my own profession, there has been a gradual increase in the share of women\nin economics, but women still remain underrepresented at the highest levels in academia, in\ngovernment and in business. There are doubtless numerous reasons for this, and in fact\neconomists themselves are among those engaged in trying to understand the factors that explain\nwhy more women aren't rising to higher levels.\nI hope we continue to seek this understanding, in my field and others where women are in\nthe minority, because the benefits of greater participation for women, it seems to me, are clear\nand substantial. As we continue to make progress in recovering from the Great Recession, our\ncountry is going to need the best efforts, ideas and talent it can muster to succeed in an\nincreasingly competitive global economy. If women’s history can shape the future, I hope that it\ninspires America to take those steps we can take to draw forth these contributions from all\nAmericans.",

    "text": "Presentation to a Seattle Community Leaders Luncheon\nMarriott Waterfront, Seattle, Washington\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery, Thursday, September 9, 2004, 1:00 PM Pacific Time, 4:00 PM Eastern\nRemarks on the U.S. Economy and Monetary Policy\nGood afternoon. And thank you, George, for that kind introduction. This is my\nfirst public speech as President of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, and it’s a\npleasure to be making my debut here in Seattle. Thank you all very much for coming.\nWhile it would be a privilege to serve as the head of any Reserve Bank, I’m especially\nhappy to have the chance to head the San Francisco Fed—and not only because the West\nhas been my home for many years. As you probably know, this Reserve District is the\nlargest of the twelve in terms of geography and population. It comprises about 20% of\nthe nation’s economy. And it’s also home to a number of industries and innovations that\nhave significant impacts on the nation’s economy. Like my predecessor, Bob Parry, I\nthink it’s important for a Fed President to learn about the District by actually traveling\naround in it and getting to know the economy and the people first-hand. And it’s very\nnice that part of getting that first-hand knowledge in this job involves visiting great cities\nlike Seattle.\nAs George said, this is not my first stint as a Fed official. Now that I’ve returned,\nI’ve been very glad—though not at all surprised—to find that the high standards of public\nservice I’ve always associated with the Fed remain solidly in place. There have been\nsome changes, however. One in particular—and it’s a change for the better, I believe—is\nthe FOMC’s effort at communication. The Committee has been placing a great deal of\n1\n\nemphasis on explaining the logic of its decisions concerning the nation’s monetary\npolicy.\nFor example, the June and August FOMC statements made clear that the current\npolicy stance is highly accommodative, so short-term interest rates have to go up to\nprevent an eventual increase in inflation. The policy challenge is to consider the\nquestion: “how fast?” At this point, we still face some uncertainties about the strength of\nthe economic expansion and the strength of job creation. At the same time, we’ve had\nsome reassuring indications that the surge in core inflation a few months ago was a short-\nlived phenomenon, although rising oil prices have pushed up measures of overall\ninflation. In light of these conditions, it made sense that the Fed engineered only modest\nincreases in the federal funds rate in both June and August.\nMy aim today is to elaborate on these points a bit and to lay out some context for\nthinking about the issues facing monetary policy going forward. I should add that my\nremarks reflect my own opinions, and they are not necessarily those of others in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nThe current economic situation\nLet me begin by trying to characterize the current economic situation. Although\nwe’re nearly three years past the official date of the end of the last recession, in some\nimportant ways, I think the economy is still operating in its wake. One of the hallmarks\nof the 2001 recession was the “investment bust,” which seems to have stemmed from a\ncase of “too much of a good thing.” The extraordinary productivity surge in the second\nhalf of 1990s—plus the buildup to Y2K—led to an investment boom that apparently went\ntoo far. The effects of the investment bust on the economy were compounded by the\n2\n\ntragic events of 9/11 and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Added to this was disquieting\nnews about corporate governance scandals, which undermined confidence. As a result,\nbusinesses seemed to be extremely cautious about their spending and hiring decisions.\nTo counter these developments, monetary policy responded aggressively, slashing\nshort-term interest rates to their lowest levels in forty years. The series of sizable tax\npackages passed by Congress, along with a pickup in spending on defense and homeland\nsecurity, provided additional stimulus to spending. In the spring of 2003, the Fed again\nresponded when the specter of deflation seemed to loom. It took out an “insurance\npolicy” to address this grave risk by lowering the federal funds rate to 1 percent.\nThese actions helped support consumer spending, which fortunately stayed strong\ndespite the 2001 recession and the “soft patch” that followed for the next year and a half.\nIn early 2003, the economy finally seemed to kick into gear, with growth averaging a\nrobust five percent between the first quarter of 2003 and the first quarter of 2004. And\nwith this strength in the economy, we started seeing healthy growth in jobs again: from\nMarch to May of this year, payroll employment rose at an average of nearly 300,000 jobs\nper month.\nBut in the second quarter of this year, growth slowed to under 3 percent, and the\npartial data available on the current quarter suggest perhaps only moderately faster\ngrowth—somewhere in the range of the economy’s long-run potential growth rate. It\nappears that businesses and consumers have, in a sense, “switched places,” with business\ninvestment in equipment and software now growing rapidly, while the consumer is\nshowing some sluggishness. Notably, the labor market stumbled, too, generating only\n85,000 jobs per month in June and July. The August data on employment were better—\n3\n\nabout 144,000 jobs were added—but that’s still just barely enough growth to keep pace\nwith increases in the size of the labor force.\nThe August 10th FOMC statement said that the slowdown “… likely owes\nimportantly to the substantial rise in energy prices.” In terms of the outlook, the\nstatement says that “the economy nevertheless appears poised to resume a stronger pace\nof expansion going forward.” A basic premise of the statement is that a rise in oil prices\nto a new higher level is likely to have only a transitory effect on output growth. In other\nwords, even if oil prices remained at a high level, real GDP growth would be expected to\nbounce back. In addition, the economy continues to benefit from substantial monetary\npolicy stimulus and a continuing need for businesses to rebuild their capital stocks after\nthe “investment bust.”\nI want to spend a few moments discussing the oil price increases, because their\nrole in the economy has important implications for the conduct of monetary policy.\nThe role of the oil price increases\nThe price of oil rose from around $30 per barrel last summer to around $45\nrecently. As the wholesale and retail markups over crude oil prices surged, gasoline\nprices rose even more sharply, although these margins have fallen substantially over the\npast couple of months. Not surprisingly, the oil price increases have spilled over into\nother energy markets like natural gas.\nThis oil shock is connected to concerns about the supply of oil, given all the\npolitical instability in the Middle East, Venezuela, Russia, and Nigeria—each seemingly\nfor different reasons. At the same time, demand for oil is very strong—not only in the\n4\n\nU.S. but also in emerging Asia, especially China—and that’s leading to a sharp increase\nin oil consumption.\nWhile oil prices are certainly high enough to grab our attention, the situation is a\nfar cry from what happened when oil prices shot up in the 1970s. It’s true that oil prices\nhave hit all-time highs in nominal terms; but, if we adjust them for the general price level,\nthey’re only about half of what they were thirty years ago. And over these thirty years,\nthe U.S. economy has become much less dependent on oil. In fact, oil consumption as a\nfraction of overall income is only about two-thirds of what it was back then.\nNonetheless, a hike of this size can restrain economic growth for a time. An\nintuitive way to think about it is to view the price increase as a kind of “tax” that U.S.\nhouseholds and businesses pay to foreign oil-producing countries. Essentially, an\nincrease in oil prices can absorb income that could have been spent on other items.\nHow big might that “tax” be? A back-of-the-envelope estimate suggests that the\nrecent increase amounts to a “tax” of about $65 billion. The more important question is,\nhow much of an effect would a “tax” of that size have on real GDP growth. Economic\nmodels—which, as always, are at best approximations—suggest that the size of the effect\nis likely to be modest, reducing real GDP growth in 2004 by somewhere in the range of\nless than a quarter percent to about half a percent.\nIt might seem surprising that the effect of this “tax” is so small, but a major\nreason has to do with the way households and firms typically respond to the tax. When\nthey face reduced incomes from this tax, they tend to change their spending patterns in a\ncouple of ways that mitigate its impact on demand and therefore on growth. First, they\nusually try to avoid the tax by consuming less oil, and this response gets bigger as time\n5\n\npasses. Second, they typically cut back their spending on things other than oil only\ngradually; that is, they try to maintain their spending for a while by dipping into savings\nand profits, so this also cushions the oil price effect.\nIf people see the price increase as temporary, they’re likely to cut back spending\nrather less; and if they see the price increase as permanent, they’d tend to cut back\nspending more. Developments in the oil futures market suggest that people may see a\nlarge portion of the recent oil shock as permanent, since the futures prices a year or so\nahead have risen by almost as much as the current price. This is unusual; generally, when\noil prices spike, the futures market expects a quick reversal. So there’s reason to think\nthat households and businesses may cut back spending more, indicating that the higher\nend of the range of estimated effects may be more appropriate.\nThe oil price hikes could be taking an even bigger chunk out of real GDP growth\nif they were undermining confidence, because that, in turn, would hold consumer\nspending down as well. This phenomenon has been observed in some other instances;\nthe 1990 oil shock associated with the first Iraq war is a good example. However, at least\nas measured by surveys, consumer confidence has held up reasonably well. Finally,\nthere’s another reason to question whether this oil shock has had exceptionally large\neffects on U.S. output; namely, other industrialized countries that depend on foreign oil\nhave exhibited only modest effects so far.\nSo, my overall assessment of the oil shock is that it undoubtedly played a role in\nthe current slowdown, but exactly how much it accounts for is a complicated question.\nTo the extent that it is playing a larger, rather than a smaller, role, we might expect more\nof a bounceback in growth once the oil shock effect passes through the economy.\n6\n\nThe outlook\nThis brings me to the outlook. In my view, it wouldn’t be surprising to see\ngrowth pick up enough to exceed the rate that can be sustained in the long run, thus\ngradually moving the labor market toward full employment. This would be a desirable\nresult, because, by my calculations, considerable slack is still left in labor markets. Some\nrecent data support the notion that growth may be rebounding. For example, much of the\nslowdown from the first quarter to the second quarter is accounted for by auto\nproduction. Auto sales have picked up so far in the third quarter after dropping in the\nsecond quarter, which suggests that more production may follow. Other data, including\nmanufacturing output, housing construction, and consumer spending on goods and\nservices, also have rebounded from their weak performances in June. And, as I\nmentioned, the labor market data for August did pick up moderately. These results are\nencouraging.\nHowever, there are some issues that have the potential to be troublesome going\nforward. As “risk managers” for the nation’s economy, I think monetary policymakers\nneed to pay attention to these issues, so I’d like to take a moment to touch on some of\nthem.\nOne concern is the personal saving rate. Over the past decade or so, the personal\nsaving rate has fallen from the 7 to 8 percent range to a range of ½ percent to 2 percent.\nWith interest rates rising and equity prices declining this year, households may try to get\ntheir finances in order and bring the saving rate up to more normal levels by cutting\nspending. A noticeable increase from today’s historically low levels could have\nimportant adverse consequences for the pace of economic expansion going forward.\n7\n\nSuch a development could be made more likely if household confidence is undermined\nby another spate of weakness in the jobs market—or, indeed, by a jobs picture that isn’t\nshowing a pretty strong upward trend.\nIn addition, with the major declines in mortgage rates behind us, the volume of\nmortgage refinancings has plummeted over the past year or so. Conceivably, equity\nwithdrawals from cash-out refinancings provided a greater boost to spending in recent\nyears than was commonly recognized, and the loss of this source of funds could\nundermine demand.\nFinally, though business investment has been strong, it has been less than one\nmight expect, given the very high corporate profits and cash flow that we’ve seen in\nrecent years. In fact, for the first time in decades, business cash flow has actually\nexceeded total capital investment. This suggests a continuation of the caution that has\nmarked business decisionmaking in the wake of the terrorist threats and the issues\nsurrounding corporate governance. This caution could be behind the inability of the labor\nmarket to establish sustained strength. As the impetus to the economy from fiscal\nstimulus wanes next year, strength in consumer and business spending will prove critical\nto the sustainability of the expansion.\nThe inflation situation\nNow let me turn to inflation. We had a bit of scare earlier this year. After rising\nby only 1-1/2 percent in 2002 and then increasing at an even lower rate in 2003, the core\nPCE price index showed increases of around 2 percent in the first half of this year. The\nFOMC was faced with the question of whether this uptick was a one-off phenomenon or\nthe beginning of a new higher trend. It now looks more likely that it was one-off for a\n8\n\ncouple of reasons. First, the surge could simply have been an offset to the unexplained\nand exceptionally low rate in 2002. This possibility now seems more likely given that\ncore inflation from May through July has dropped back to the lower rates seen earlier.\nSecond, some of the uptick undoubtedly was due to higher oil prices being passed\nthrough to prices of core goods and services. A higher price of oil can lead to a\npermanently higher overall price level, and this can show up in inflation rates for a while.\nMoreover, if oil prices were to keep rising for a time, the boost to inflation could be\nextended. But ultimately, a higher price of oil is unlikely to raise the rate of inflation\npermanently unless it gets built in to expectations of future inflation and therefore into\nwage bargaining. In any event, both inflation expectations and actual inflation remain\nwell contained, at least for now.\nMoreover, while significant risks to the inflation rate remain, they seem well\nbalanced on both the high side and the low side. On the high side, the obvious risk is that\noil prices could rise even further. They have been surprising most forecasters for over a\nyear now. If this pattern continues, it would tend to boost core inflation for a time.\nOn the low side, profit margins have been extraordinarily large, and the mark-up\nof goods prices over unit labor costs has risen to a new high. Basically, the rapid\nproductivity gains we’ve seen have held down business costs, and most of these gains\nhave gone into higher profits rather than higher compensation for labor. This large mark-\nup could return to more normal levels through falling inflation or through faster growth in\nlabor compensation. We saw such a run-up and rapid reversion toward normality during\nthe second half of the 1990s. It’s possible that if prices and wages share the adjustment\n9\n\nover the next year and a half—consistent with typical historical experience—the restraint\non inflation could be quite significant.\nMonetary policy implications\nWhat does all of this mean for monetary policy? As I’ve pointed out, policy is\nstill very accommodative, with the federal funds rate at one and half percent and inflation\nat about the same rate so that the “real” or inflation-adjusted federal funds rate is close to\nzero. To get an idea of how far we are from a neutral stance, economists compare the\nfunds rate to a benchmark called the equilibrium rate. This is the rate that would be\nconsistent with full employment of labor and capital resources over the intermediate run,\nafter incorporating the inflation rate and taking into account the rate of productivity\ngrowth in the economy, various demand factors like fiscal policy, international\ndevelopments, and other factors. Estimates of the equilibrium rate are highly uncertain\nand may change over time. That said, most estimates put the current equilibrium rate in\nthe range of 3-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent. In other words, according to these estimates, the\nfunds rate would need to rise considerably above its current level for policy just to have a\nneutral effect on the economy. With the actual funds rate currently as low as it is, there is\nthus reason for a strong presumption that rates will need to keep going up as we move\nforward.\nIn both June and August, the Federal Open Market Committee tightened policy\nslightly. The Committee indicated in its statement that, based upon what it then knew,\nremoval of policy accommodation at a “measured pace” would most likely prove\nappropriate to promote the outlook for the economy that I’ve described—a moderate\nacceleration in growth with well-contained inflation.\n10\n\nOf course, the Committee must remain very watchful as developments unfold,\nand be prepared to consider modifications in its course of action as needed to ensure price\nstability. For example, there could be a need to consider moving more aggressively if\ninflation showed signs of rising significantly. But as I said, there is reason to feel\nsomewhat more comfortable than I did a few months ago that core inflation is still well\ncontained. On the other hand, there might be a need to consider pausing in the process of\nraising rates if slower growth in demand caused economic activity to slow down. This\nconcern seems less acute than it did a month or so ago. But I still see it as a significant\nissue, warranting careful attention.\nThe Committee would face a particularly tough policy choice if higher oil prices\nwere to exact a continuing toll on economic activity. We know from history that oil\nshocks put monetary policymakers on the horns of a dilemma, because those shocks both\nraise inflation and reduce output. The dilemma is: Do we fight inflation and risk\nweakening the economy even more? Or do we boost the economy and risk even higher\ninflation? Fortunately, we have the benefit of hindsight to give us some guidance. We\nlearned some bitter lessons from the oil crisis of the 1970s; in particular, we learned that\nmonetary policy should not be so accommodative that higher inflation gets built in to\ninflation expectations and wage bargaining. Once this happens, it can be extremely\ndifficult to rein inflation in without creating a severe recession. Therefore, it would make\nsense to react to concerns about both inflation and weak activity. If the Committee were\nto face that situation, given the low level of the funds rate today, the policy response\ncould involve moderate increases in the funds rate that restrain inflation while continuing\nto provide some support to the economy.\n11\n\nLet me end where I began. As I said at the outset, a key feature of current\nmonetary policy is the emphasis on communication and transparency. This effort has\nbeen ongoing for a long time, and it has intensified over the past year. The reason for the\nfocus on communication is that economic developments are affected by longer-term\ninterest rates, equity values, the exchange rate, and other asset values—and these factors\ndepend not only on the current funds rate, but more importantly on the expected future\npath of the funds rate. Clear, straightforward language that helps explain to markets and\nthe public what the Fed is looking at, and why, can make policy more effective by\nfostering the appropriate expectations and decisions. Clear communication can also help\navoid financial disruptions when policy enters a new phase. I think that what happened\nin June is a perfect case in point. It was my first meeting, and the Committee voted to\nraise rates a quarter point for the first time in three years. Some people asked me\nafterwards if the discussion at the meeting had been kind of uninteresting, because the\noutcome had been very well anticipated by market participants. I responded, “On the\ncontrary. I take this as a mark of success of the FOMC’s new strategy.”\nI hope that my comments today have done their part to communicate my thinking\nas a Fed policymaker. Now I’ll be glad to take any questions.\n# # #\n12",

    "text": "Presentation to The Institute of Regulation & Risk, North Asia\nHong Kong\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on November 17, 2009, 6:30 PM local Hong Kong time, 5:30 AM Eastern,\n2:30 AM Pacific\nLinkages between Monetary and Regulatory Policy: Lessons from the Crisis1\nF\nThank you. It is a great privilege to be here among such a distinguished group. I want to\nthank the Institute of Regulation & Risk for inviting me to speak tonight and express my\nparticular gratitude to Ms. Au King-chi of the Hong Kong Government and Mr. Norman Chan of\nthe Hong Kong Monetary Authority. I’m especially grateful to our gracious host Mr. Robert\nPringle. Given the limited time I have, I will try to lay out some broad themes concerning the\nimplications of the financial crisis for regulatory reform and monetary policy. My comments are\nmy own and do not necessarily reflect the views of my Federal Reserve colleagues. I look\nforward to the extended discussion we shall have later tonight when we will be able to delve\nmore deeply into these critical issues.\nIn the past, monetary and regulatory policies have generally been viewed as separate\ndomains with distinct objectives. The primary focus of monetary policy has been on attaining\nthe macroeconomic goals of low inflation and a stable economy. In the United States, these\ngoals find their expression in the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate of maximum employment and\nprice stability. By contrast, regulatory policy has generally pursued significantly different ends:\nprotecting the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions and reducing systemic\nrisk.\n1 I would like to thank John Williams and Sam Zuckerman for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n1\n\nOf course, monetary and regulatory policies do not exist in total isolation and the Federal\nReserve, an institution with responsibilities in both domains, has long recognized some important\nlinkages. For example, it’s clear that the effectiveness of monetary policy and the performance\nof the macroeconomy depend greatly on maintaining a stable and healthy financial system. And\na sound economy makes the work of regulators much easier because economic downturns put\nconsiderable stress on the financial system. In addition, the insights we derive from our\nsupervision of banking organizations are helpful in formulating monetary policy. And the\neconomic analysis that underpins monetary policy improves our understanding of the risks\nconfronting financial institutions. Nonetheless, policymakers have generally viewed monetary\nand regulatory questions as separate disciplines, and we have designed our strategies and carried\nout our policies accordingly.2\nF\nThe painful events of the past two years have fundamentally challenged this\ndichotomization of monetary and regulatory policies. It is no longer obvious that setting policies\nto stabilize the economy on the one hand and to safeguard the financial system on the other can\nbe cleanly separated—either in conception or implementation.3 This experience has important\nF F\nimplications for both monetary and regulatory policy. Here I will focus on the conceptual issues,\nleaving aside vital questions concerning implementation, such as the appropriate division of\nauthority among different regulatory bodies—a subject that is under discussion in the United\nStates.\n2 At times, the connections between monetary policy and regulation have become more apparent. For example, the\nabolition of Regulation Q in the United States had a direct bearing on how monetary policy affected the economy\nand the appropriate monetary policy response to shocks (see Mauskopf 1990).\n3 See Shirakawa (2009) for further discussion on this point.\n2\n\nLet me start by considering our regulatory responsibilities. Government agencies have\nlong practiced micro-prudential supervision and regulation—that is, oversight of individual\nfinancial institutions aimed at preserving their safety and soundness. Indeed, micro-prudential\nsupervision—including on-site examinations, surveillance, guidance, regulations, and\nenforcement—is the first line of defense against systemic risk. The crisis has taught us valuable\nlessons on how to strengthen supervision going forward. For example, we need to develop\nstronger and more effective capital and liquidity standards, strengthen our oversight of risk\nmanagement practices, and insure that compensation arrangements do not create incentives that\ncould compromise safety and soundness.4 In the United States, we also gleaned important\nF F\ninsights on how to improve our consolidated supervision of bank holding companies through this\nyear’s stress test of the 19 largest banking organizations, as part of the Supervisory Capital\nAssessment Program. We intend to make such horizontal institutional reviews involving\nmultidisciplinary teams an important component of our supervision going forward. Currently,\nwe are conducting a horizontal assessment of internal processes for evaluating capital adequacy\nat the largest U.S. banking organizations and will shortly undertake a similar horizontal review\nof incentive compensation practices.\nOverall, the crisis has exposed serious deficiencies in our micro-prudential regulatory\nstructure. We clearly need to address gaps, such as inadequate authority or tools to properly\nsupervise the so-called shadow banking system, including major investment banks, nonbank\nlenders, and vital financial insurance providers such as AIG.\nA broad consensus exists that we need to make these changes. But, it is critical to\nrecognize that carrying bigger sticks as micro-prudential supervisors entails tradeoffs between\n4 See, for example, Crockett (2009) and Tarullo (2009) for discussions of these issues.\n3\n\nstability and efficiency—that is, between managing systemic risk and cultivating a fertile\nenvironment for economic growth. Admittedly, we may well have been operating far off the\noptimal tradeoff curve in recent years! Still, in designing a new regulatory framework, we must\nbe aware that stronger capital standards that reduce leverage might hamper the flow of funds to\nbusinesses and households in ways that could impede investment and consumption. Of course,\nfinding the right balance is an immense challenge.\nTo strike that balance between stability and growth, we should examine what other policy\nweapons should be in our arsenal. Perhaps the most important are in the area of macro-\nprudential oversight, which we increasingly understand is an essential complement to micro-\nprudential supervision. Now, what exactly does macro-prudential supervision entail? To me, it\nmeans identifying and correcting behaviors and structures in financial markets that create\nexcessive risk before they mushroom into something that threatens the entire financial system.\nThis requires real-time collection and analysis of data from a wide variety of financial\ninstitutions and markets, the deployment of tools to mitigate the inherent pro-cyclical tendencies\nof financial markets, and new resolution powers to deal with the failure of any institution that\nposes a threat to financial stability.\nMacro-prudential supervision takes a very different perspective than its micro-prudential\nsibling. It’s akin to caring for an entire ecosystem rather than individual trees. It is targeted at\nspillovers and externalities that contribute to systemic risk even when they don’t directly harm\nindividual institutions. An example is an investment strategy that is highly positively correlated\nacross institutions. Taken in isolation, each institution may appear to be adequately managing\nliquidity, capital, and exposure to risk. But, when many large institutions invest in the same\nclass of assets, a downturn in that asset class can cause a rush to the exits as everyone tries to sell\n4\n\nat the same time. That’s exactly what happened in 2007 and 2008 in the markets for mortgage-\nrelated securities, with disastrous effects that we know too well. In the worst case, correlation\ncan feed contagion that spreads across the globe as institutions seek to rapidly deleverage and\nprotect liquidity. This presents a regulatory challenge of the first order: How are we to measure\nand safeguard against such highly correlated investment strategies? Research is under way now\nto provide some answers.5 One promising strategy is to implement a system that would require\nF F\nbanking organizations to build capital buffers in good times that could be run down under\nstressful conditions. Such a system could serve as an automatic stabilizer, mitigating the buildup\nof leverage in booms and the destabilizing impact of broad-based deleveraging in downturns.\nOther practices may also be ripe for macro-prudential supervision. They include pro-\ncyclical underwriting standards, shortcomings in the provision of liquidity and credit risk\nprotection during crises, and payment and clearing systems.6 For example, markets for over-the-\nF F\ncounter derivatives, including credit default swaps, lack the stabilizing mechanisms associated\nwith central exchanges.7\nF F\nA key issue in macro-prudential supervision concerns the too-big-to-fail problem of\nsystemically important financial institutions. A number of approaches have been suggested to\nlimit the systemic risk from large, interconnected financial institutions. These include capping\nthe size of these institutions, moving some activities to exchanges or clearing firms, requiring\nthem to hold more capital, and reducing their odds of failure by requiring them to hold debt that\nautomatically converts to equity in a crisis situation. It is also essential to devise effective means\n5 See Caruana (2009) and Adrian and Brunnermeier (2009).\n6 See Bernanke (2009) and Dudley (2009) for further discussion of these and related issues of macro-prudential\nregulation.\n7 See Duffie and Zhu (2009) for an analysis of the problems associated with clearing credit default swap contracts.\n5\n\nto resolve large, highly interconnected financial institutions in an orderly manner to minimize the\ndamage to the financial system. In the United States, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\nuses a well-tested and highly effective procedure for resolving commercial banks and thrifts.\nBut, for nondepository financial institutions, the standard bankruptcy process is all that’s\navailable. We’ve seen that the mere hint a financial institution is headed for bankruptcy can set\noff a run, depriving it of vital short-term funding and leaving it incapable of paying creditors. As\nrecent events attest, in the cases of systemically important institutions, the end result can be\nmarket turmoil, cascading declines in valuations, and panic.\nMacro-prudential supervision has the potential to lower systemic risk and thereby create a\nmore secure financial system that will contribute to macroeconomic goals as well. But,\nmonetary policy may also play a role in managing systemic risk. One notable feature of boom-\nand-bust cycles has been highly pro-cyclical leverage at primary dealers, such as investment\nbanks. Recent research by Tobias Adrian and Hyun Shin suggests that monetary policy affects\nthese cycles in asset growth.8 Specifically, they find that periods when monetary policy is\nF F\n“tight” relative to the predictions of an estimated Taylor rule are associated with weaker growth\nin holdings of repurchase agreements by primary dealers.9 By contrast, “easy” monetary policy\nF F\nis associated with rapid increases in financial institution balance sheets that can add to systemic\nrisk.10\nF\nThese results suggest that monetary policy could play a role in restraining undesirable\nswings in leverage and, by extension, reduce systemic risk. In particular, interest rate cuts in a\n8 See Adrian and Shin (2008a).\n9 Taylor (2007) describes a different channel, but comes to the same conclusion that monetary policy can contribute\nto undesirable booms and busts.\n10 See Adrian and Shin (2008b, 2009). They also find evidence that asset growth is linked to housing construction.\n6\n\ntime of market disruption can be effective at stopping a deleveraging cycle from turning into an\nuncontrolled crash. And higher rates than called for based on purely macroeconomic conditions\nmay help forestall a potentially damaging buildup of leverage and an asset price boom.\nThis raises the broader—and very contentious—issue of whether monetary policy should\nseek to lean against potentially dangerous swings in asset prices. The answer is far from clear,\nbecause the use of monetary policy for these ends necessarily compromises the attainment of\nother macroeconomic goals. Because such use of monetary policy is costly, high priority should\nbe assigned to developing regulatory tools to address systemic risk. Even so, the crisis of the\npast two years has prompted many of us to reexamine the widely held view that monetary policy\nshould respond to asset prices only to the extent that they influence the anticipated trajectories of\ninflation and unemployment. Further research into the connections among monetary policy, the\nbanking and financial sectors, and systemic risk is needed to help answer this question.11\nF\nIn summary, the events of the past few years compel us to reexamine many of our long-\nheld ideas and practices in both monetary and regulatory policy. I am gratified that researchers\naround the world are looking hard at these questions. In addition, I am encouraged by the sense\nof purpose and cooperation exhibited by my colleagues at central banks, governments, and\ninternational organizations in their efforts to develop policies that will help us avoid the kind of\ncrisis we have just experienced. Thank you.\n11 Increasingly macroeconomists are incorporating banking and financial frictions in their macroeconomic models.\nSee, for example, Curdia and Woodford (2009) and Gertler and Karadi (2009).\n7\n\nReferences\nAdrian, Tobias, and Markus K.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n9:15 a.m. EDT\nMay 6, 2015\nFinance and Society\nRemarks by\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Finance and Society,” a conference sponsored by\nInstitute for New Economic Thinking\nWashington, D.C.\nMay 6, 2015\n\nLet me begin by thanking the organizers for inviting me to participate in this\nimportant dialogue on the role of finance in society. The financial sector is vital to the\neconomy. A well-functioning financial sector promotes job creation, innovation, and\ninclusive economic growth. But when the incentives facing financial firms are distorted,\nthese firms may act in ways that can harm society. Appropriate regulation, coupled with\nvigilant supervision, is essential to address these issues.\nUnfortunately, in the years preceding the financial crisis, all too many firms took\non risks they could neither measure nor manage. Leverage, interconnectedness, and\nmaturity and liquidity transformation escalated to dangerous levels across the financial\nsystem. The result was the most severe financial crisis and economic downturn since the\nGreat Depression. Almost 9 million Americans lost their jobs, roughly twice as many\nlost their homes, and all too many households ended up underwater on their mortgages\nand overburdened with debt. To be sure, some individuals and families borrowed\nunwisely, but too often financial institutions encouraged the behavior that resulted in\nsuch excessive debt.\nIn my remarks today I will discuss some important reasons why the incentives\nfacing financial institutions were distorted and the steps that regulators are taking to\nrealign those incentives.\nThe Important Role of the Financial Sector\nBefore discussing the incentives that contributed to the buildup of risk at financial\ninstitutions, I would like to highlight the important contributions that the financial sector\nmakes to the economy and society. First and foremost, financial institutions channel\nsociety’s scarce savings to productive investments, thereby promoting business formation\n\n- 2 -\nand job creation. Access to capital is important for all firms, but it is particularly vital for\nstartups and young firms, which often lack a sufficient stream of earnings to increase\nemployment and internally finance capital spending. Indeed, research shows that more\nhighly developed financial systems disproportionately benefit entrepreneurship.1\nThe financial sector also helps households save for retirement, purchase homes\nand cars, and weather unexpected developments. Many financial innovations, such as the\nincreased availability of low-cost mutual funds, have improved opportunities for\nhouseholds to participate in asset markets and diversify their holdings.2 Expanded credit\naccess has helped households maintain living standards when suffering job loss, illness,\nor other unexpected contingencies.3 Technological innovations have increased the ease\nand convenience with which individuals make and receive payments.4\nThe contribution of the financial sector to household risk management and\nbusiness investment, as well as the significant contribution of financial-sector\ndevelopment to economic growth, has been documented in many studies.5 Such research\n1 Recent reviews have highlighted potential costs of a distorted financial sector, but such reviews also\nemphasize the range of both theoretical and empirical work that has documented the many ways in which\nthe financial sector can support economic efficiency; see, for example, Greenwood and Scharfstein (2013)\nand Zingales (2015). Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales (2004) discuss evidence that financial development\nsupports entrepreneurship, and Fort and others (2013) examine the importance of financing for business\nformation and young firms.\n2 Greenwood and Scharfstein (2013) discuss how an important fraction of growth in the U.S. financial\nsector reflects the greater demand of households for asset management services and credit. Malkiel (2013)\nconsiders similar issues and reviews how improved access to low-cost investment options has benefited\nhouseholds.\n3 Krueger and Perri (2006) analyze how an increase in access to credit contributed to households’ ability to\nsmooth spending despite substantial income volatility.\n4 Changes in payment technologies have been rapid, and an area of particular interest is the fast growth of\nmobile payment and financial service technologies. The Federal Reserve has conducted several surveys to\nunderstand these developments, and the most recent results are discussed in Board of Governors (2015).\n5 A substantial body of research finds that financial development supports economic growth, including\nGoldsmith (1969), King and Levine (1993), Rajan and Zingales (1998), and Levine (2005). It is\nnoteworthy that this research emphasizes differences across countries, and that the United States is among\nthe most financially developed countries in the world.\n\n- 3 -\nshows that, across countries and over time, financial development, up to a point, has\ndisproportionately benefited the poor and served to alleviate economic inequality.6\nDistorted Incentives in the Financial Sector\nDespite these benefits, as we have seen, actions by financial institutions have the\npotential to inflict harm on society. Instead of promoting financial security through\nprudent mortgage underwriting, the financial sector prior to the crisis facilitated a bubble\nin the housing market and too often encouraged households to take on mortgages they\nneither understood nor could afford. Recent research has raised important questions\nabout the benefits and costs of the rapid growth of the financial services industry in the\nUnited States over the past 40 years.7\nA combination of responses to distorted incentives by players throughout the\nfinancial system created an environment conducive to a crisis. Excessive leverage placed\ninstitutions at great risk of insolvency in the event that severe, albeit low-probability,\nproblems materialized. Overreliance on fragile short-term funding by many institutions\nleft the system vulnerable to runs. And excessive risk-taking increased the probability\nthat severe problems would, in fact, materialize. Moreover, regulators--and the structure\nof the regulatory system itself--did not keep up with changes in the financial sector and\nwere insufficiently attuned to systemic risks. Once concerns began to develop about\nescalating losses at large firms, insufficient liquidity and capital interacted in an adverse\n6 Beck, Demirgüç-Kunt, and Levine (2007) show that financial development reduces poverty and inequality\nin a study examining evidence across countries.\n7Zingales (2015) raises a number of questions regarding ways in which distortions in the financial sector\nmay contribute to “rent seeking” activity that may promote inefficiency. Philippon and Reshef (2012)\nexamine trends in compensation in the financial sector and the contribution of such trends to the increase in\nincome inequality in the United States in recent decades. Philippon and Reshef (2013) and Cecchetti and\nKharroubi (2012) revisit the links between financial development and economic growth, focusing\nparticularly on these relationships around periods of rapid growth in the financial sector or among\neconomies with a large financial sector.\n\n- 4 -\nfeedback loop. Funding pressures contributed to “fire sales” of financial assets and\nlosses, reducing capital levels and heightening liquidity pressures--culminating in the\nnear collapse of the financial system in late 2008.\nCapital and liquidity\nSeveral factors encouraged excessive leverage, including market perceptions that\nsome institutions were “too big to fail.”8 Financial institutions also had an incentive to\nengage in regulatory arbitrage, moving assets to undercapitalized off-balance-sheet\nvehicles. The complexity of the largest banking organizations also may have impeded\nmarket discipline. In addition, financial intermediation outside of the traditional banking\nsector grew rapidly in the years up to 2007, leaving gaps in the regulatory umbrella. And\nconflicts in the incentives facing managers, shareholders, and creditors may have induced\nbanks to increase leverage.9\nTo strengthen banks’ resilience, the Federal Reserve and the other banking\nagencies have substantially increased capital requirements. Regulatory minimums for\ncapital relative to risk-weighted assets are significantly higher, and capital requirements\nnow focus on the highest-quality capital, such as common equity. In addition to risk-\nbased standards, bank holding companies and depositories face a leverage ratio\nrequirement. Also, significantly higher capital standards--both risk-weighted and\nleverage ratios--are being applied to the most systemically important banking\norganizations. Such surcharges are appropriate because of the substantial harm that the\n8 For a review of many factors that may have contributed to leverage in the financial sector and a discussion\nof how, in some cases, these factors reflect distortions that imply leverage was excessive, see Admati and\nothers (2013a).\n9 The notion that “agency problems”--that is, conflicts in the interests of managers and various stakeholders\nin firms--may contribute to excessive debt has a long history, most notably following the notion of “debt\noverhangs” from Myers (1977). Hanson, Kashyap, and Stein (2011) emphasize the potential importance of\nthis issue for the financial sector. Admati and others (2013b) present a related mechanism.\n\n- 5 -\nfailure of a systemic institution would inflict on the financial system and the economy.\nHigher capital standards provide large, complex institutions with an incentive to reduce\ntheir systemic footprint. We are also employing annual stress tests to gauge large\ninstitutions’ ability to weather a very severe downturn and distress of counterparties and,\nimportantly, continue lending to households and businesses. Firms that do not meet these\nstandards face restrictions on dividends and share buybacks. As a result of these changes,\nfor the largest banks, Tier 1 common equity--the highest-quality form of capital--has\nmore than doubled since the financial crisis.\nNew liquidity regulations will also improve incentives in the financial system.\nPrior to the crisis, institutions’ incentives to rely on short-term borrowing to fund\ninvestments in riskier or less liquid instruments were distorted in two important ways.\nFirst, many investors were willing to accept a very low interest rate on short-term\nliabilities of financial institutions or on securitizations without demanding adequate\ncompensation for severe-but-unlikely risks, such as a temporary loss of market liquidity.\nPerhaps these firms expected government support or simply considered illiquidity a very\nremote possibility. Second, institutions’ attempts to shift their holdings once concerns\nabout credit or liquidity risk arose created a fire-sale dynamic that amplified declines in\nmarket values, causing unanticipated spillovers onto other institutions and across\nmarkets.10\nRecently implemented regulations aim to strengthen liquidity. For example, a\nnew liquidity coverage ratio requires internationally active banking organizations to hold\n10 The notion that securities issued by financial institutions may provide liquidity services in a manner that\npotentially contributes to fragility because such securities do not have the safety and liquidity of publicly\nissued securities is examined in, for example, Gorton, Lewellen, and Metrick (2012); Stein (2012); and\nGorton and Ordoñez (2014).\n\n- 6 -\nsufficient high-quality liquid assets to meet their projected net cash outflows during a 30-\nday stress period. A new process--the Comprehensive Liquidity Analysis and Review--\nsets supervisory expectations for liquidity-risk management and evaluates institutions’\npractices against these benchmarks. A proposal for a net stable funding ratio would\nrequire better liquidity management at horizons beyond that covered by the liquidity\ncoverage ratio. A proposed capital surcharge for the largest firms would discourage\noverreliance on short-term wholesale funding. Also, the Securities and Exchange\nCommission has adopted changes in regulations that may help avoid future runs on prime\nmoney market mutual funds (that is, money funds that invest primarily in corporate debt\nsecurities). And reforms in the triparty repo market have reduced risks associated with\nintraday exposures.\nLarge, complex institutions and too big to fail\nIn the aftermath of the crisis, the Congress tasked the banking regulators with\nchallenging and changing the perception that any financial institution is too big to fail by\nensuring that even very large banking organizations can be resolved without harming\nfinancial stability. Steps are under way to achieve this objective. In particular, banking\norganizations are required to prepare “living wills”--plans for their rapid and orderly\nresolution in the event of insolvency. Regulators are considering requiring that bank\nholding companies have sufficient total loss-absorbing capacity, including long-term\ndebt, to enable them to be wound down without government support.11 In addition, the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation has designed a strategy that it could deploy\n11 For a discussion of total loss-absorbing capacity, see Financial Stability Board (2014), a consultative\ndocument on a proposal for a common international standard on total loss-absorbing capacity for global\nsystemic banks. The comment period on this FSB proposal ended in February of this year.\n\n- 7 -\n(known as Single Point of Entry) to resolve a systemically important institution in an\norderly manner.\nThe crisis also revealed that risk management at large, complex financial\ninstitutions was insufficient to handle the risks that some firms had taken. Compensation\nsystems all too frequently failed to appropriately account for longer-term risks\nundertaken by employees. And lax controls in some cases contributed to unethical and\nillegal behavior by banking organizations and their employees. The Federal Reserve has\nmade improving risk management and internal controls a top priority. For example, the\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, which includes the stress tests that I\nmentioned, also involves an evaluation to ensure firms have a sound process in place for\nmeasuring and monitoring the risks they are taking and for matching their capital levels\nto those risks. Also, supervisors from the Fed and other agencies have pressed firms to\nimprove their internal controls and to make their boards of directors more directly\nresponsible for compensation decisions and employee conduct.\nChanges to Regulatory and Supervisory Focus\nAs I noted, the financial crisis revealed weaknesses in our nation’s system for\nsupervising and regulating the financial industry. Prior to the crisis, regulatory agencies,\nincluding the Federal Reserve, focused on the safety and soundness of individual firms--\nas required by their legislative mandate at the time--rather than the stability of the\nfinancial system as a whole. Our regulatory system did not provide any supervisory\nwatchdog with responsibility for identifying and addressing risks associated with\nactivities and institutions that were outside the regulatory perimeter. The rapid growth of\nthe “shadow” nonbank financial sector left significant gaps in regulation.\n\n- 8 -\nIn response, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of\n2010 (Dodd-Frank Act) expanded the mandate and authority of the Federal Reserve to\nallow it to consider risks to financial stability in supervising financial firms under its\ncharge. Within the Federal Reserve System, we have reorganized our supervision of the\nmost systemically important institutions to emphasize what we call a “horizontal\nperspective,” which examines institutions as a group and in comparative terms, focusing\non their interaction with the broader financial system. We also created a new office\nwithin the Fed to identify emerging risks to stability in the broader financial system--both\nthe bank and nonbank financial sectors--and to develop policies to mitigate systemic risk.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created the interagency Financial Stability Oversight Council,\nchaired by the Treasury Secretary, and the Federal Reserve is a member. It is charged\nwith identifying systemically important financial institutions and systemically risky\nactivities that are not subject to consolidated supervision and designating those\ninstitutions and activities for appropriate supervision. And it is charged with encouraging\ngreater information sharing and policy coordination across financial regulatory agencies.\nWhere We Stand\nMy topic is broad, and my time is short. Let me end with three thoughts. First, I\nbelieve that we and other supervisory agencies have made significant progress in\naddressing incentive problems within the financial sector, especially within the banking\nsector. Second, policymakers, including those of us at the Federal Reserve, remain\nwatchful for areas in need of further action or in which the steps taken to date need to be\nadjusted. And, third, engagement with the broader public is crucial to ensuring that any\nfuture steps move our financial system closer to where it should be. Active debate and\n\n- 9 -\ndiscussion of these issues at this conference and in other forums is important to improve\nour understanding of the challenges that remain.\n\n- 10 -\nReferences\nAdmati, Anat R., Peter M.

    "text": "San Diego Community Leaders’ Luncheon\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery September 8, 2005, 12:40 PM Pacific Time, 3:40 PM Eastern Time\nViews on the Economy and Implications for Monetary Policy\nIt’s a pleasure to be here with you in San Diego. My remarks today will focus on\nthe nation’s economy and the implications for monetary policy. As I was preparing for\nthis event a few weeks ago, I originally had in mind a fairly upbeat talk about an\neconomy that was in reasonably good shape. Since then, of course, a great deal has\nhappened. The country has come face to face with a natural disaster of enormous\nproportions, particularly in terms of the human tragedy that has occurred in its wake. Our\nthoughts and best wishes are with those in the Gulf Coast and with their families, and,\nindeed, with those who have gone to help.\nWith a disaster of this magnitude, the economic effects go well beyond New\nOrleans, Gulfport, Biloxi, and all the other devastated towns and cities in the hurricane’s\npath. Clearly, there are national implications, since that region is an important hub for\nexports and imports and an important center for the oil and gas industries. Since the\neffects of Hurricane Katrina are of national economic significance, I certainly plan to\ndiscuss how I believe they might factor into decisions about monetary policy.\nBut there is more to the story of the Federal Reserve’s response than just\nmonetary policy. And I’d like to take a moment to tell you a little about it. First let me\nnote that the Federal Reserve itself was among those institutions that felt this disaster\ndirectly. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta has a Branch Office in the city of New\nOrleans. The building was closed after safely evacuating all but a small crew to maintain\nsecurity. That Branch Office, like others around the country, plays an important role in\n1\n\nkeeping cash and checks moving through the nation’s payments system. Though that\nbuilding is closed for business, the functions are definitely ongoing thanks to the efforts\nof Fed staff in neighboring locations, including Birmingham, Memphis, and Houston.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco is involved, too, because the national\nresponsibility for the Fed’s cash operations resides with the Cash Product Office of our\nBank, directed by Mark Mullinix, who heads our Los Angeles office. Obviously, the\nimmediate job is to make sure that there are adequate cash inventories available to meet\ndemand. This has involved bringing into play many contingency plans, such as\nextending the hours of the cash shops involved to include weekends, beefing up the\ninventory of currency available for payout by drawing on excess currency in other parts\nof the country, and freeing up currency that was stored in a non-Fed location in the event\nof just such an emergency. All told, nearly three quarters of a billion dollars have been\npaid out through these alternative arrangements. For the check business, similar\ncontingency plans have been put into place, as well as some extension of credit for banks\nin the area that have not been able to reopen.\nAnother way that the Fed is working to keep the financial system in that region on\na sound footing is by joining with other regulators and affected financial institutions to\nidentify customer needs and monitor institutions’ restoration of services. Along with\nother regulators, the Fed recently issued a statement urging depository institutions to\nconsider all prudent and reasonable actions that could help meet the critical financial\nneeds of their customers and their communities. This includes allowing loan customers\nto defer or skip some payments, easing credit card limits and credit terms for new loans,\n2\n\nraising ATM withdrawal limits, and relaxing restrictions on cashing out-of-state and non-\ncustomer checks.\nNow let me turn to the economy and monetary policy. Even before Hurricane\nKatrina and all that has followed, I would have said that the conduct of monetary policy\nhad reached a challenging phase. We had gone through a period in which inflation was\nwell contained but the economy had a lot of slack. In that phase, it was obvious that\npolicy needed to be highly accommodative. Then, as slack diminished, it seemed equally\nobvious that the Fed needed to gradually remove policy accommodation—“normalizing”\nthe stance of monetary policy. The goals of these policy actions, of course, are to set the\neconomy on track so that inflation stays low and excess slack in the labor market is\nabsorbed. As that occurs, real output growth must converge toward its potential rate for\ninflation to remain under control, which, in turn, requires that monetary policy reach a so-\ncalled neutral stance. Such a trajectory still remains a plausible, even probable, scenario.\nHowever, as we’ve come closer to these goals, the appropriate policies are not as obvious\nas they were before, as the potential for undershooting or overshooting the goals looms\nlarger. Indeed, uncertainties and risks that could complicate things considerably were\nevident even before the havoc unleashed by Hurricane Katrina, so our approach during\nthis phase must be particularly dependent on information from incoming data.\nAs for the impact of the situation in the Gulf Coast on policy, there are a couple of\nideas I’ll expand on later in my remarks, but I’d like to state them briefly here. In my\nview, the greatest contribution monetary policy can make is to keep the national economy\non an even keel. Monetary policy, unfortunately, has little scope to cushion the\nimmediate economic fallout from such a severe and sudden blow to a region, because\n3\n\nmonetary actions can’t be directed at a particular area of the country, and their effects\ntake time to be felt. It is fiscal policy—government spending and transfers—that is\nnecessary to address the immediate needs of the affected areas. Monetary policy may\ncome into play, however, in counteracting those impacts from the hurricane that continue\nover time and affect the country as a whole. I’m thinking particularly of the hurricane’s\neffects on energy prices, which could be a threat if their effects are long-lasting. The\nGulf Coast is important to our nation’s energy supplies, and the associated problems are\ncoming at a time when oil prices were already high. I’ll come back to this issue after\nbriefly reviewing recent economic developments—indicating where the economy has\nbeen and how policy has responded.\nBeginning on the real side of the economy, the nation’s output growth has\naveraged about three and one-half percent over the past year, a rate that is moderately\nabove trend, which is now probably around three to three and a quarter percent. The\nnational unemployment rate has gradually dropped to 4.9 percent, which is near\nconventional estimates of the natural rate consistent with “full employment.”\nThis growth has been achieved in the face of some significant drags on economic\nactivity—a growing trade gap, a very cautious environment around business investment,\nand, of course, high oil prices. That is why, as I mentioned earlier, the Committee kept\nits main policy instrument, the federal funds rate, very low for quite some time in the\nwake of the last recession.\nFocusing on oil prices, they have more than doubled in the past year and a half\nand recently spiked above $70 a barrel. Over the last several decades, most fluctuations\nin oil prices have proven to be “transitory” and, not surprisingly, the view that oil price\n4\n\njumps will be temporary is typically reflected in futures prices. During the run-up of spot\noil prices over the past year and a half, in contrast, far-dated oil futures prices also have\nincreased sharply, suggesting that high oil prices may be here to stay. This is a highly\nunusual development. It probably reflects the perception that global demand will remain\nstrong in an environment where there is little excess supply of oil available in the world\nand where geopolitical uncertainty creates risks to existing supplies. High oil prices, of\ncourse, impose a tax on consumers that erodes their spending power while impinging on\nbusinesses’ bottom lines. The perception that the on-going oil price shock is more\npermanent tends to intensify its negative spending impacts. However, it is worth\nemphasizing that, after adjusting for inflation, the current price of oil is still well below\nthe inflation-adjusted peak price reached during the oil shocks in the early 1980s.\nMoreover, the energy intensity of the U.S. economy is far lower than it was in those days.\nTo offset the negative impact on spending stemming from oil and the other drags I\nmentioned, monetary policy had to remain highly accommodative for a substantial\nperiod—stimulating interest-sensitive sectors, particularly consumer durables and\nhousing. Over time, however, as slack in resource use diminished—that is, jobs have\ngrown and capacity utilization has risen—the FOMC has gradually been able to lift its\nfoot off the accelerator, removing policy accommodation. At each of its last ten\nmeetings, the FOMC raised the federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point,\nbringing it to three and a half percent today.\nAs I said, during the process of removing accommodation, incoming data have\nbecome increasingly influential in my own assessments of the further policy measures\nthat are needed to move the economy toward this desirable trajectory.\n5\n\nFor example, data during the late spring and early summer suggested that\naggregate demand was stronger than had been previously thought, implying greater\nmomentum in spending. Moreover, the data showed a drop in the pace of inventory\naccumulation, especially for autos. Therefore, most forecasters were predicting fairly\nrapid growth for the second half of the year, as firms rebuild their inventories, with a\nreturn to trend-like growth in 2006. This potential for a bulge in growth in the second\nhalf of 2005—with labor markets apparently already near full employment—was seen as\nraising inflationary risks.\nNow, of course, developments in the Gulf Coast come into play, altering the\nexpected pattern for the national output data. Disruption of production in the Gulf will\nundoubtedly slow growth somewhat in the second half—a common estimate is that it will\ndepress national real GDP growth by around one-half to three-quarters percent. This is\nlikely to be followed by a surge in growth as the government-assisted rebuilding kicks\nin—hopefully before too long.\nIn addition to these effects relating directly to the Gulf Coast area, however,\nthere has been the potential for negative impacts on national spending due to the spike in\nenergy prices that occurred right after the hurricane. The Gulf Coast plays a significant\nrole in the country’s energy supply because of its extensive drilling, refining, and\ndistribution infrastructure. For example, offshore crude oil and natural gas production in\nthe Gulf of Mexico account for approximately 29 percent and 19 percent respectively of\ntotal U.S. production levels. Importantly, Gulf Coast refineries account for a whopping\n47 percent of total U.S. refining capacity.\n6\n\nHigher energy prices, as I mentioned, sap the spending power of both households\nand businesses over other goods and services. These effects tend to hit the economy\ngradually with long lags and are one of the factors that the Fed routinely takes into\nconsideration in conducting monetary policy. Like all so-called negative supply shocks,\nan energy shock presents complex choices for monetary policy. It reduces output and\nemployment for a time, which calls for easier policy, but it also temporarily raises\ninflation, which calls for tighter policy. Moreover, the size of these two effects is\ndifficult to gauge in advance. Part of the difficulty is that the impact depends on whether\npeople see the latest rise in oil prices as short-lived or longer-lasting. The longer-lasting\nthe effects are seen to be, the bigger the effect on spending.\nFortunately, there is growing evidence of recovery in the energy infrastructure\nalong the Gulf Coast. Although many refineries and pipelines were affected initially,\nreports indicate that more and more are coming on line. In addition, after the steep run-\nup in energy prices, both spot and futures prices have retreated significantly.\nLet me now turn from the real side of the economy to inflation, again\nemphasizing how incoming data have influenced my own assessment of the appropriate\npath for monetary policy. I’ll focus particularly on something called the personal\nconsumption expenditures price index, excluding food and energy. I realize I just said a\nmouthful, and I apologize. But it’s important to mention it, because it’s a comprehensive\nmeasure of core consumer inflation that the Fed carefully monitors. That measure rose\nby 1-3/4 percent over the last 12 months, suggesting that inflation has been relatively\nwell-contained over the past year. And core inflation has dipped a bit over the last few\nmonths.\n7\n\nOf course, the issue for policy is not so much where inflation was in the past, but\nrather where inflation is headed. In this regard, it seems likely that, even with inflation\nexpectations well contained—which they have been according to most indicators—higher\noil prices may be partly passed through to core inflation at least for a time. Supply\ndisruptions emanating from the Gulf Coast disaster may also affect the prices of building\nmaterials and transportation services. Two further key influences on inflation are\nproductivity growth and the pace of compensation growth, since both affect the behavior\nof business costs. Recent data revisions lowered estimates of productivity growth over\n2001 to 2004 somewhat and reveal a deceleration in productivity growth over the past\nyear or so. These revisions probably warrant a modest decrease in our estimates of\nstructural productivity growth—the underlying noncyclical portion of productivity which\nis most relevant in assessing inflationary pressures. That said, it’s very encouraging that\neven after a downward adjustment, structural productivity still appears to be growing\nsomewhat faster than the robust rates achieved in the second half of the 1990s, and it\nremains quite strong by historical standards.\nWith respect to labor compensation, my sense from the data and our business\ncontacts is that cost pressures remain in check, although recent data also give conflicting\nsignals. One key measure, the Employment Cost Index, has recorded only modest\nincreases over the past year. A second more inclusive measure of compensation shows a\nmore substantial rise. It is also worth noting that, over the last few years, an unusual\nsituation has emerged in which profits have risen at an exceptionally rapid pace in\ncomparison with labor income, pushing up capital’s share of GDP to a very high level by\nhistorical standards. A more rapid rise in compensation per hour could be part of the\n8\n\nprocess by which labor’s share of income returns to more normal levels, hence\nunthreatening from an inflation standpoint. As we assess the likely behaviour of wage\npressures going forward, we must also factor in the influence of slack in labor and\nproduct markets. The decline in the unemployment rate to 4.9 percent in August, coupled\nwith some improvement in measures such as the employment-population ratio and\nindustrial capacity utilization, suggest that while a “whisker” of slack may still remain,\nwe probably can’t count on slack to hold inflation down.\nTaking all of these factors into account, my overall assessment is that core\ninflation—that is, excluding food and energy—seems relatively well contained at the\npresent time. However, there are a myriad of uncertainties about how things will unfold\nover the next year or two, and the uncertainties on the upside have only gotten bigger\nsince Hurricane Katrina slammed into the Gulf Coast.\nIn addition to the uncertainties I’ve already mentioned, there is, of course, the\nhousing market. With the share of residential investment in GDP now at its highest level\nin decades, a key question is whether this source of strength in the economy could reverse\ncourse and become instead a source of weakness. One common way of thinking about\nhousing valuations is to consider the ratio of housing prices to rents. The price-to-rent\nratio is equivalent to the price-to-dividend ratio for stocks. Historically, the ratio for the\nnation as a whole has had many ups and downs, but over time it has tended to return to its\nlong-run average. Thus, when the price-to-rent ratio is high, housing prices tend to grow\nmore slowly or fall for a time, and when the ratio is low, prices tend to rise more rapidly.\nI want to emphasize, though, that this is a loose relationship that can be counted on only\nfor rough guidance rather than a precise reading.\n9\n\nIn the San Diego area, the very rapid increase in house prices over the past few\nyears has pushed the ratio well above its long-run average, making it among the highest\nin the nation. Of course, a high ratio in this area does not necessarily mean that one\nshould expect a commensurately large price adjustment going forward. There are\nstriking regional variations in house-price appreciation, and some areas may have high\nrelative prices for good fundamental reasons. For example, an area like San Diego may\nnot have much room to expand the housing stock as demand grows. And given how\nattractive San Diego is, demand may be expected to keep rising in the future as well. Of\ncourse, I’m not making any predictions about house prices here or anywhere else. I’m\nonly pointing out some issues that should be considered.\nFor the nation, the price-to-rent ratio is higher than at any time since data became\navailable in 1982. The natural question to ask is can such a high value be explained by\nfundamentals? Probably the most obvious candidate for a fundamental factor is low\nmortgage interest rates. And the phenomenon of low long-term interest rates raises some\nissues of its own because there is a controversy about just why they have stayed so low.\nAs I’ve said, over the past year, the Fed has raised the federal funds rate significantly.\nNormally, long-term interest rates also rise with increases in the expected path for the\nfederal funds rate. But, long-term rates—such as those on 30-year fixed rate\nmortgages—have actually fallen over the period. This is what Chairman Greenspan has\nlabelled a conundrum because there seems to be no convincing explanation for it.\nWhile low mortgage rates explain part of the unusually high price-to-rent ratio\nnationally, the consensus seems to be that mortgage rates are not low enough to explain\nmuch of the run-up in the ratio. Moreover, with controversy over exactly why long-term\n10\n\ninterest rates have remained so low, we can’t rule out the possibility that they would rise\nto a more normal relationship with short-term rates, and this obviously might take some\nof the “oomph” out of the housing market. So, while I’m certainly not predicting\nanything about future house price movements, I think it’s obvious that the housing sector\nrepresents a risk to the outlook.\nLet me close by summarizing where I think the economy is now heading and the\nrole of monetary policy in guiding its evolution. I have emphasized in this talk that a\nnumber of risks cloud the outlook. The tragic disaster in the Gulf region tops the list of\nrisks to the national economy at this stage, given the importance of this area to energy,\ntrade, and transportation. I have also discussed risks relating to housing markets and the\ncurrent configuration of interest rates. Even taking these risks into account, the economy\noverall, in my estimation, is doing reasonably well and could settle into a highly desirable\npattern of full employment, trend-like real GDP growth, and well-contained inflation.\nThe job of monetary policy is to foster exactly such an outcome.\nIt is worth recognizing that the U.S. economy has shown great resilience in the\nface of other disasters with national impacts, such as 9/11, Hurricane Andrew, and the\nNorthridge earthquake. Of course, the toll from Hurricane Katrina has already proved to\nbe staggering in human terms and, in this instance, the national economy will be affected\nthrough the region’s key role in trade and energy markets. The size of these impacts\ndepends in part on how quickly the vast energy infrastructure in the region can be\nbrought back to operating condition. While recent indicators provide room for optimism,\nwe are still at an early stage in the process of assessing the effects of the hurricane.\n11\n\nThere are no easy answers as this stage. I hope I’ve given you some insight into\nwhat kinds of things we will be looking at over the period ahead.\n12",

    "text": "Presentation to the Bay Area Council 2006 Outlook Conference\nSan Jose, California\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on Tuesday, April 18, 2006, 8:45 AM Pacific Daylight Time,\n11:45 AM Eastern\nProspects for the Economy\nThank you very much for inviting me to join you today. It’s a real pleasure to be\npart of this outstanding event exploring the future of the Bay Area and of California.\nNow that Lenny has given you a look at the economic profile of the Bay Area,\nI’m going to take on a bigger canvas and paint a picture of the forecast for the nation as a\nwhole. The national picture certainly contains some features that are key factors in the\nfortunes of the Bay Area economy—particularly housing markets. Of course, the overall\nperformance of the national economy will impact Bay Area firms and the state and local\neconomies.\nMy plan is to paint the outlook in three parts—economic growth, labor markets\nand resource utilization, and inflation. I’ll start each one with fairly broad brushstrokes,\nand then I’ll fill in the highlights and shadows—that is, the factors that add uncertainty to\nmy views on the future. I’ll conclude with some thoughts on how I view this picture\nfrom my perspective as a monetary policymaker. Then, of course, I would welcome your\nquestions and comments. But before I begin, let me note that my remarks represent my\nown views and are not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nI’ll start with the broad brushstrokes on the outlook for economic activity.\nProspects for growth in the year ahead are solid at the national level, and of course, this\ncan only be good news for the Bay Area and California as well. The U.S. economy has\n1\n\nshown remarkable resilience in the face of some severe shocks—in particular, the surge\nin energy prices that began a couple of years ago and the devastation wrought by the twin\nhurricanes last summer. Although economic growth came in pretty weak in the fourth\nquarter of last year, it appears to have roared back in the first quarter of this year.\nIf growth were to continue to roar—that is, to keep running at an unsustainable\npace for too long, raising the risk of building inflationary pressures—monetary\npolicymakers like me would start getting those frowny lines in their foreheads. But, at\nthe moment, my brow is fairly smooth. My best guess is that economic activity will\nremain healthy, supported by strong productivity growth and continued strength in\nconsumer spending and business investment, especially investment by the vital high-tech\nsector. But I don’t think we will get a repeat of the very rapid first quarter growth.\nRather, I expect economic activity to settle back to a more trend-like and sustainable rate\nas the year progresses.\nOne reason why is that part of the strength in the first quarter is likely just the\nflip-side of some temporary factors that made the economy weak in the fourth quarter—\nthings like the immediate disruptive effects of the hurricanes and harsh winter weather\nthat held back consumer spending. Another reason is that the Fed’s gradual removal of\nmonetary policy accommodation should tend to damp the pace of activity. This effect is\nlikely to be reinforced by a related development—a significant moderation in the rate of\nappreciation of house prices. This could well restrict not only the pace of residential\nconstruction but also the pace of consumer spending. For example, some observers\nbelieve that consumer spending has been bolstered by the withdrawal of equity from\nhousing, and, of course, this source of funds would be smaller if the pace of appreciation\n2\n\nabated. Furthermore, there is the so-called wealth effect on spending, because houses are\nsuch an important part of many people’s portfolio of assets. With this asset appreciating\nmore slowly, consumers are likely to pull back on spending.\nNow let me fill in the highlights and shadows—some of the factors that could\nmake economic activity either stronger or weaker going forward. First, house prices\ncould surprise us in either direction. In other words, instead of the significant moderation\nI’ve built into my forecast, house price appreciation could either slow much more than I\nexpect, or it could continue at its current pace. If it slows much faster—or, worse yet,\nreverses course—the impact could be very restrictive for both residential construction\nand consumer spending. Alternatively, house prices might go on climbing as fast as ever.\nIf so, the continued stimulus to spending could keep economic activity growing at an\nunsustainable pace, creating inflationary risks.\nSo far, the early signs of cooling in U.S. housing markets are broadly consistent\nwith the degree of moderation I’ve envisioned. Home sales, especially new home sales,\nare off their peaks, and mortgage refinancing is way down. Moreover, the available\nevidence suggests that the rate of increase of selling prices for new homes has slowed\nover the last several months. Looking ahead, the ratio of new houses for sale to those\nsold—a kind of inventory-to-sales ratio for homes—has risen rather sharply since the\nsummer, suggesting that other signs of cooling in the housing market may become more\nevident.\nOf course, housing markets are a big issue in the Bay Area, and we have seen the\nsame kind of cooling as in the nation. The question of whether the housing stock here is\novervalued and therefore particularly vulnerable to downside risk, however, is one I can’t\n3\n\nanswer with any certainty. I would note that there are some special things about the Bay\nArea on both sides of the question. For example, consider some tentative evidence on the\nside of greater vulnerability. First, average house prices in the Bay Area are now about\nsix times what they were in 1982, versus only 3-1/2 times in the U.S. as a whole.\nMoreover, the ratio of house prices to rental rates—a measure of the price of houses\nrelative to the flow of housing services they provide—has more than doubled since 1982,\nfar out-stripping the national average.\nBut, even considering these features, there are well-known and unique features of\nthis area that lend some justification to its high housing values. First, there is not much\nland available for new home building, so the supply of new homes is fairly limited. In\naddition, this area enjoys very favorable lifestyle amenities and it has a job base that\nattracts high-income residents.\nRelated to the house price story is another risk factor for the growth forecast,\nnamely, the so-called “bond rate conundrum.” Essentially, long-term interest rates have\nbeen surprisingly—and inexplicably—low relative to the path of short-term rates\nexpected by the markets. If the relationship were to return swiftly to something closer to\nthe historical norm—that is, if long-term rates were to rise suddenly—economic growth\nmight slow more than my forecast suggests.\nIn fact, so far this year, bond rates have climbed some, although even now they\nare only modestly higher than when the Fed began raising the federal funds rate, back in\nJune 2004. Does this rise in long-term rates pose a downside risk to growth? Frankly, I\nthink it’s too soon to tell, but I’ll give you a flavor of the views pro and con. On the\n“pro” side, the rebound in longer-term rates may partly reflect an unwinding of the\n4\n\nconundrum due to an increase in the “term premium” toward more normal levels. It\nmight also reflect a strengthening of economies abroad: specifically, greater spending on\ngoods and services in Europe and especially Japan may be absorbing more of the supply\nof worldwide savings and driving up bond rates in the U.S. and everywhere else. On the\n“con” side, the rise in U.S. bond rates might itself reflect expectations of even stronger\ngrowth in the U.S. While we don’t have an answer yet, I hope this discussion at least\nconveys a sense of why developments relating to the yield curve will definitely be on my\nradar screen.\nThe final factor that could alter the forecast for economic growth—one that I will\nreturn to when I discuss inflation—is energy prices. So far, at least, the near doubling of\nenergy prices has not been reflected in slower consumer spending—possibly because of a\nstimulatory offset from rising house prices. My assumption, based on the forecasts\nembodied in futures markets, is that energy prices will stabilize around their current\nlevels. If so, the negative effect on spending should dissipate over 2006, and, as it does,\nthis would actually contribute to higher overall economic growth. Of course, predicting\nenergy prices is an exercise fraught with uncertainty, and any sustained rise or fall in\nthese prices could either depress or spur economic activity beyond my current\nexpectations.\nNow to the next part of the picture—labor markets and resource utilization. My\nbroadbrush view is that the economy is now operating in the vicinity of “full\nemployment.” Looking ahead, if the growth rate of economic activity returns to its trend,\nas seems likely, then labor markets are likely to remain at this level.\n5\n\nTo paint the picture in more detail, the March unemployment reading of 4.7\npercent is actually a bit below conventional estimates consistent with so-called “full\nemployment.” On its own, this suggests that there may even be a bit of excess demand in\nthe labor market. But looking at a variety of indicators—such as the employment-to-\npopulation ratio, surveys of job market perceptions, and capacity utilization—suggests a\nrange of estimates from a modest amount of slack to a modest amount of excess demand\nin the U.S. economy. A final indicator is labor compensation, since slack often works\nthrough this channel to influence price increases. And, at this point, that channel has\nshown no sign that we have overshot full resource utilization. In fact, growth in total\ncompensation in private industry, as measured by the Employment Cost Index, actually\ndeclined last year to under 3 percent from nearly 4 percent in 2004. Let me note,\nhowever, that I have heard from a number of my business contacts that the market for\nskilled workers appears to have tightened noticeably, with some upward wage pressure\nemerging in some sectors.\nThis brings me to the inflation part of the picture itself. Over the past twelve\nmonths through February, inflation, as measured by the core personal consumption\nexpenditures PCE price index—is up 1.8 percent. This measure, which FOMC\nparticipants forecast semiannually for Congress, is an index of consumer prices that\nexcludes the volatile food and energy component. This rate is in my “comfort zone”—a\nrange between one and two percent. I consider core PCE inflation in this range an\nappropriate long-run inflation objective for the Fed.\nWhat are the prospects for inflation over the next year or two? When I look at all\nof the elements that influence inflation, it seems that the most likely outcome over the\n6\n\nnext year or so is that inflation will remain contained, although there are risks, and I think\nthey are tilted slightly to the upside. First, there is the possibility that inflation could\nintensify if labor and product markets continue to tighten. Next, there are risks relating to\nenergy and commodity prices. Apparently, we haven’t had much in the way of pass-\nthrough from past increases in energy and commodity prices to core inflation yet, but I\nwouldn’t be surprised if some modest amount were evident in the next couple of quarters.\nAssuming, however, that energy and commodity prices level out, and, importantly, that\nlonger-term inflation expectations remain stable, I would expect any pass-through of\nearlier increases to boost core inflation only temporarily. We learned from history that\ninflation expectations that are well-anchored to price stability are critical to maintaining\nlow inflation. And, indeed, research suggests that they are well-anchored, because people\nare confident that the Fed will act to limit any sustained rise in inflation. In the current\nsetting, this result shows up in the stability of our measures of core inflation as well as\nvarious survey and market measures of inflation expectations.\nIn concluding my remarks, I want to step back from the easel, where I’ve been\npainting this picture of the economy, so that I can take it in as a whole, the way a\nmonetary policymaker should. What I see is essentially pretty positive. The economy\nappears to be approaching a highly desirable trajectory. First, real GDP growth currently\nappears to be quite strong, but there is good reason to expect it to slow to around its\npotential rate as the year progresses. If it does, the degree of slack should remain within\nrange of full employment and have little effect on inflation going forward. Although\ninflation is in the upper portion of my comfort zone, it appears to be well contained at\npresent, and my best guess for the future is that it will remain well contained.\n7\n\nMoreover, this desirable trajectory appears to be within reach at a time when the\nFed’s key policy interest rate—the federal funds rate—is close to a neutral stance, one\nthat neither stimulates the economy nor restrains it. Before I seem to make this picture\ntoo rosy-looking, I want to remind you that there are a lot of uncertainties on both the\nupside and the downside—those highlights and shadows I’ve discussed. And any of\nthem could certainly be disruptive, especially if the Fed does not react quickly and\nappropriately.\nSo, the key question for policy is: What interest rate path will help the economy\nachieve the desirable trajectory? As you know, the Fed has raised the federal funds rate\nby 25 basis points at each of the last 15 FOMC meetings for a total increase of 375 basis\npoints and indicated that further policy firming may be needed. Until recently, the funds\nrate was low enough that it seemed rather clear that this path of gradually removing\naccommodation had some way to go.\nHowever, enough has been done by now that I view decisions about the path of\npolicy going forward as quite data-dependent. This phrase—“policy will be data-\ndependent”—is all the rage right now in policy circles, but I think it’s worth a moment to\nclarify what I mean when I use it. To me, it means that we should interpret the\nimplications of incoming data for our forecast and evaluate whether resulting changes in\nthe forecast call for a change in the policy path.\nFor example, as I mentioned, there is little evidence thus far of pass-through into\ncore inflation of previous hikes in energy and commodity prices. But I would not be\nsurprised to see some modest transitory pass-through over the next few quarters. I would,\nhowever, be surprised to see evidence suggesting that labor markets had tightened\n8\n\nenough to boost inflationary pressure. I also expect longer-term inflation expectations to\nremain well contained.\nSimilarly, I expect first quarter real GDP growth to be quite strong, and I’ve\nalready factored that into my views. The accumulation of more and more monthly data\nsupporting that expectation does not necessarily alter my views on policy. I will, of\ncourse, be quite alert to any signs that the hot pace of growth may not slow after the first\nquarter. That would constitute a surprise.\nBut, by the same token, I am increasingly concerned about the well-known long\nand variable lags in monetary policy—specifically, that the delayed effects of our past\npolicy actions might impact spending with greater force than expected. This could show\nup especially in the housing market and via housing prices and balance sheet effects on\nconsumer spending. While I expect the housing sector to slow somewhat, I will be\nhighly alert to the possibility of the policy tightening going too far. So, I’m watching the\ndata for confirmation of my forecast and for surprises that would make me alter my\nforecast. It’s not really data-dependence, but more accurately, data-surprise dependence.\nIn summary, I would not want to prejudge future decisions to raise rates—or to\nhold them steady—but rather I will be highly sensitive to the implications of incoming\ndata for the forecast for economic growth, employment, and inflation.\n# # #\n9",

    "text": "Speech to the Joint Rotary Clubs of Reno and the East Bay (SF Bay Area)\nReno, Nevada\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery January 22, 2007, 12:20 PM Pacific Time, 3:20 PM Eastern\nThe U.S. Economy in 2007: Prospects and Puzzles\nGood afternoon, everyone. I was very pleased to receive your invitation to speak\nto the Rotary Club of Reno, because it gives me a chance to visit an important part of our\nDistrict and to meet with area businesspeople. The Federal Reserve places a high priority\non communication, and I definitely see that as a two-way street. Although I anticipate\nholding the floor for a full half hour, I am also very interested in hearing your\nobservations on economic conditions, both nationally and locally.\nMy remarks today will center on recent developments affecting employment,\noutput, and inflation in the U.S. economy and what they may portend for the future and\nespecially for the conduct of monetary policy. In doing so, I will spend some time\nfocusing on an emerging puzzle in the data: why is the labor market apparently going\ngangbusters, while growth in real GDP has turned in only a middling performance on\naverage in recent quarters?\nBefore I begin, let me note that my comments represent my own views and not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nIn describing the economy’s recent growth performance as “middling,” as I just\ndid, I was not making a pejorative judgment. On the contrary, this relatively modest pace\nof growth is roughly what I would have expected, given the course of monetary policy.\nAs you no doubt remember, the Federal Open Market Committee began to remove\nmonetary stimulus in mid-2004, after a long stretch of keeping the federal funds rate—\n\nour main policy tool—at a very low level. Altogether, there were 17 quarter-point\nincreases in the funds rate over about two years. During much of that time, the economy\naveraged solid growth, and the labor market tightened, with unemployment declining\nabout a full percentage point to 4.5 percent, an exceptionally low level by historical\nstandards. The object of the policy tightening was to slow the economy’s growth to a\nmore sustainable pace and to foster a gradual decline in inflation, promoting price\nstability. In August of last year, the Committee voted to “pause,” that is, not to raise the\nfunds rate another quarter point, but to leave it at 5¼ percent. By then, some of the\neffects of the earlier increases were being felt, as the economy showed signs of slowing,\nand this gave some sense of reassurance that inflation was likely to moderate from an\nelevated level. The aim of these policy moves, to my mind, at least, was thus to set the\neconomy on a glide path for the proverbial “soft landing”—an orderly slowing of growth\nthat avoids the risk of a severe downturn while producing enough slack in labor and\ngoods markets to relieve inflationary pressures and, indeed, to bring inflation down\ngradually to a more acceptable level than it has registered over the prior year or so.\nIn large measure, the economy has moved within range of this outcome. Since\nthe stepwise increases in the funds rate began, short- and intermediate-term interest rates\nhave risen substantially. For example, Treasury bill rates are up by more than 3½\npercentage points from mid-2004. It’s true that long-term rates, including conventional\nmortgages, are actually down a bit over this period. However, variable mortgage rates\nhave risen along with short-term rates.\nThe overall effect of such rate changes has been to reduce demand. For example,\nalthough long-term fixed mortgage rates have not changed much, the rise in variable\n\nmortgage rates probably has contributed to the housing downturn, which has been a drag\non the economy. I should note, however, that interest rates are not the only culprit. It’s\nlikely that the recent cooling also is a necessary correction after years of rapid run-ups in\nhouse prices that ultimately proved to be unsustainable. Nationally, housing permits are\ndown by about 25 percent from a year ago, and inventories of unsold houses are up\nsignificantly. The national data on residential investment reflect these developments and\nenter directly into the calculation of real GDP growth. After adjusting for inflation, (real)\nresidential investment registered its fourth straight decline in the third quarter, which held\noverall real GDP growth down by a substantial 1¼ percentage points. The partial data\nwe have on the fourth quarter suggests that there was a similar effect then.\nWhile the decline in housing activity has been significant and will probably\ncontinue for a while longer, I think the concerns we used to hear about the possibility of a\ndevastating collapse—one that might be big enough to cause a recession in the U.S.\neconomy—have been largely allayed. As I mentioned, long-term rates have remained\nlow, and that has helped to cushion the downturn in housing activity. Likewise, the fears\nabout plummeting house prices have not materialized at the national level, though some\npockets of the country have seen house prices actually decline. The Reno area provides a\nstriking example of how the market has turned around: after rising about 20 to 30 percent\nannually in 2004 and 2005, prices on existing homes began to fall in the second quarter\nof 2006. The decline appears to be modest so far.1 But for the country as a whole, house\n1 Based on OHFEO repeat-sales index, prices on existing homes sold in the Reno area rose 30.4% in 2004\nand 22.5% in 2005, while NAR median price data show an increase of 25.5% in 2004 (2005 data are not\navailable). By contrast, in 2006, the value of the OFHEO index fell at about a 3% annual pace in the\nsecond and third quarters, leaving prices approximately flat on net for the first three quarters; the NAR\nmedian price series shows larger declines (4.0% pace in Q2, 13.3% in Q3). Data recently reported in local\nnewspapers indicate that the median sales price fell further in October.\n\nprices have continued to appreciate, though obviously at a much more moderate rate than\nthey did earlier. The concern here was that a significant fall in the prices of houses,\nwhich make up such a significant part of so many people’s wealth, could lead to a\nweakening in consumer spending. Since consumption expenditures represent two-thirds\nof real GDP, even relatively modest effects of declining housing wealth could put a\nnoticeable dent in overall economic activity. While slower house price appreciation is\nundoubtedly imparting less impetus to consumer spending now than during the years of\nrapid run-ups, consumer spending remains solid overall, outpacing real GDP growth in\nthe second half of last year. We have seen few signs of substantial negative spillovers\nfrom weakness in housing markets to consumer spending.\nLooking at other sectors of the economy, we see a pretty robust picture, for the\nmost part. Business demand has been solid, fueled by high profits and relatively\nfavorable financing conditions, leading to healthy growth in spending on business\ninvestment in equipment and software, especially in the high-tech industries. Moreover,\nspending for the construction of nonresidential structures advanced smartly last year, and\npromises to remain robust for a while longer. For example, outlays on drilling and\nmining structures have continued to increase in response to oil prices that are still high by\nhistorical standards, though the pace of investment is moderating. Furthermore,\nfundamentals in commercial real estate markets improved last year, increasing demand\nfor commercial space from office parks to warehouses. Going forward, even at a more\nmoderate pace of economic expansion, private forecasters expect the positive trends in\ncommercial real estate to continue but to moderate over the year as capacity comes\nonline.\n\nIn addition to housing, auto production has been a drag on the economy during\nthe past few quarters. The auto industry has felt the effects of high oil prices and\npeople’s growing preferences for more fuel-efficient vehicles. That has been good news\nfor some of the foreign automakers, but not such good news for some U.S. automakers,\nfor whom SUVs and trucks have been a key source of strength. As the demand for these\nvehicles dropped, producers found themselves holding unsustainably high inventories.\nSo it's little wonder that they moved to ramp down production. These production cuts\nslowed overall real GDP growth in the U.S. in 2006. However, once the adjustment to a\nlower level of inventories is reached, probably in the not too distant future, this factor\nwill cease to hold down growth in the U.S. economy.\nIn fact, energy prices themselves could be a source of support for growth this\nyear. Over the past couple of years, the surge in the price of oil took a bite out of\nconsumer spending, even though other factors, like growth of jobs, wages, and wealth,\nkept consumption moving up overall. Needless to say, it has been a relief to see that oil\nprices have not just stabilized but actually receded quite a bit since their peak in the\nmiddle of last year. At this point, futures markets expect them to stabilize around the\ncurrent lower levels, and if they do, not only should the restraint we felt last year\nevaporate this year; the decline in oil prices would actually contribute to a pickup in\ngrowth. Of course, given the well-known volatility of energy markets, that's a very big\n\"if,\" so they remain a wild card in the outlook as usual.\nSo, to sum up the story on output, real GDP advanced at moderate rates of only\n2½ and 2 percent in the second and third quarters of last year. Recent monthly data have\nboosted estimates of growth in the fourth quarter, but such high frequency data can be\n\nvolatile, and very recent developments don’t change my overall assessment that\neconomic activity is proceeding at a moderate underlying pace. In other words, it looks\nas if the economy is pretty close to the “glide path” I mentioned before—growth has\nslowed to a bit below most estimates of the economy’s long-run potential, while the risk\nof an outright downturn has receded.\nThat would all be very comforting, except for the puzzle I mentioned at the\nbeginning, which could have serious implications for inflation and, therefore, for the\n“soft landing” I’m hoping for. Just to restate the puzzle: if the economy is growing a bit\nbelow its long-run trend, why is the labor market going gangbusters? It is as if the\nBureau of Economic Analysis, which produces the GDP data, hasn’t delivered its\nmessage to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The latest labor-market data show payroll\nemployment growing steadily and at a rather robust pace. Moreover, the unemployment\nrate has declined by ½ percentage point over the past year and now stands at 4½ percent;\nthat rate suggests a degree of tightness in the labor market, because it is somewhat below\ncommon estimates of the rate that can be sustained in the long run without generating\nrising inflation. Using a standard rule of thumb, the unemployment rate should have been\nessentially unchanged, given the 3 percent growth rate the economy has averaged over\nthe past four quarters.\nThe ramifications of this puzzle are significant. If labor markets are as tight as the\nunemployment rate suggests, then there may be reason for concern about building\ninflationary pressures. If, on the other hand, they are not, then it is more likely that we\nare headed for a “soft landing.”\n\nLet me start with the worrisome possibilities, in which the puzzle could indicate\nbuilding inflationary pressures. One such possibility is that the apparent disconnect\nbetween labor markets and output reflects a misreading of how close output is to its long-\nrun capacity. This could happen because the economy’s long-run capacity may actually\nbe lower than many estimates. It also could happen if output is actually growing faster\nthan the data show. In fact, there are indications to that effect, namely, that actual output\ngrowth may have been faster than the pace reflected in measured GDP.\nAggregate statistics on the U.S. economy are calculated in two ways—we have\nmeasurements of total output and separate measurements of total income. In principle,\nthese must be the same—every dollar of output generates a dollar of income for some\neconomic entity, be it an individual or a firm. However, in practice, the statistical\nsources for output and income are different, so that the two measurements need not come\nout to the same aggregate number. This difference is known as the “statistical\ndiscrepancy,” a topic that tends to put even economists to sleep. However, I raise this\nobscure issue because it could have important implications.\nGrowth in gross domestic income has outpaced growth in gross domestic product\nby a whopping three-quarters of a percentage point over the past year. If the income\nmeasure ends up being more accurate than the output measure, then the decline in the\nunemployment rate this year would not be surprising at all. Indeed, this would mean that\nboth labor and product markets have been tight, which would add to our estimate of\ninflation pressures.\nNow let me turn to the more benign possibilities, that is, where labor markets may\nnot be signaling growing inflationary pressures. One possibility is that the disconnect\n\nbetween the unemployment rate and output growth will be resolved by a little more\npatience. Labor markets adjust to output growth with a lag, and that lag is not always\nconsistent over time. So we may just need a little more time for the standard relationship\nto reassert itself, with increases in unemployment that reestablish the normal relationship\nwith the slower rate of growth we’ve seen.\nAnother possibility is that even after the lags have worked themselves out, the\nunemployment rate may be overstating the tightness of labor markets. One form of\nevidence for this is that certain other labor market indicators suggest a bit of softening.\nIn particular, the Conference Board index of job market perceptions, which is based on a\nsurvey of households, declined in both October and November. This index is historically\nvery highly correlated with the unemployment rate, but now it is sending a different\nsignal, suggesting that labor markets are roughly in balance, not tight. Similarly, in\nNovember, fewer firms reported openings that are hard to fill.\nAnother form of evidence bearing on this benign interpretation relates to labor\ncompensation. If labor markets are tight, one would expect that labor compensation—\nincluding both wages and benefits—would be rising rapidly. However, the available\ninformation on this provides a mixed, and, I must admit, a somewhat confusing picture.\nWe have two broad measures of labor compensation. One, the employment cost index, is\nshowing remarkably restrained increases of only 3 percent over the past year, about the\nsame as in the prior year, and this development would seem to belie tight labor markets.\nThe other measure, compensation per hour, gives a higher reading of more than 4¼\npercent.2 However, this measure includes compensation methods like stock options that\nare more akin to profits than wages. So part of the strength in this measure may not\n2 Corrected January 26, 2007.\n\nactually indicate a tight labor market. Taken together, these two indicators provide at\nbest a mixed picture of tightness.\nMy own sense of how the labor market situation will affect inflation inclines me\nmore toward the benign view than the worrisome view—and I say this with the\nappropriate caveats, of course: There are indeed large uncertainties—and in particular,\nupside risks—to the outlook for inflation.\nTo begin with, over the past year, our main measure of consumer inflation—the\nprice index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, or the\ncore PCE price index—has increased by 2.2 percent, which is higher than I would like to\nsee. On a more positive note, inflation has come down in recent months, with this index\nup by a more acceptable 1.8 percent over the past three months.\nOne reason why inflationary pressure may be easing is due to the impact of\nstabilizing, and now falling, oil prices. As I mentioned, core inflation, by definition,\nexcludes energy prices, but energy prices still may affect core inflation to the extent that\nthey affect the prices of other goods and services. For example, transport companies\nmight raise their prices to pass along the higher costs of filling their trucks' gas tanks.\nThis is known as \"pass-through,\" and it is likely that it has played at least some role in\nrecent movements in core inflation. Now that energy prices have fallen a fair bit from\nrecent highs and are expected by futures markets to remain at those lower levels, this\nupward pressure on core inflation is likely to dissipate and may even be turning into\nmodest downward pressure.\nHowever, it’s important to recognize that the effects of energy price changes on\ninflation are inherently temporary. Once they have fully worked through the system, we\n\nwill be left with the more fundamental and enduring influences of factors such as the\nextent of labor and product market tightness. This is why I spent so much time going into\nthe puzzle about why labor and product markets are currently sending mixed signals\nabout inflationary pressures. How this puzzle is resolved is a key issue for future\ninflation and therefore for monetary policy.\nA second reason to be optimistic about future inflation is that inflation\nexpectations appear to have been well anchored over the past ten years or so as the Fed\nhas established its credibility with the public about both its commitment to and its\ncompetence in keeping inflation at low and stable rates. For example, in the face of the\nlarge oil price increases we've seen in recent years, this credibility shows up in the\nstability of survey and market measures of inflation expectations looking ten years ahead.\nStatistical analysis of the behavior of core inflation over time also lends some\nsupport to the view that inflation expectations are well anchored. In such statistical\nanalyses, the inflation data historically have exhibited “persistence.” This basically\nmeans that, when you're forecasting inflation, it works pretty well to assume that the rate\nin the future will be the same as it is today. The implication of persistence is frankly\nworrisome: Since inflation is too high today, persistence implies it could stay too high\nfor an extended period.\nHowever, research suggests that if a central bank's commitment to price stability\nhas gained credibility with the public, then the persistence observed in the inflation data\nwill tend to be dampened. And as it turns out, recent research at the Federal Reserve\nBank of San Francisco finds less evidence of persistence during the past ten years. That\nis, rather than sticking at a certain rate, core inflation has tended to revert to its long-run\n\naverage, which, over that period, is between 1-3/4 and 2 percent. Admittedly, the past ten\nyears constitute a relatively small sample from which to draw definitive conclusions.\nNonetheless, this evidence is important because, if it holds up, it implies that inflation\nmay move down from its elevated level faster than many forecasters expect.\nTo sum up my inflation forecast, then, I find recent inflation readings\nencouraging, but I also am keenly aware that this pattern has yet to show up in the data\non any sort of a sustained basis. The inflation situation remains uncertain and, in\nparticular, there are upside risks to my outlook, especially having to do with the situation\nin labor markets.\nThese considerations play a key role in my views on monetary policy. I have\nsupported the decision to hold policy steady at the current rate. That may seem a little\nsurprising, given that inflation remains higher than I would like it to be and that there are\nsome upside risks to my inflation outlook. Let me be clear that I do want inflation to\nmove down, but I believe policy may now be well-positioned to foster exactly such an\noutcome while also giving due consideration to the risks to economic activity.\nI came to this conclusion by considering a variety of metrics that help assess the\nstance of policy. These measures include the forecast I have outlined today, as well as\nthe recommendations from commonly used Taylor rules for monetary policy, named after\nJohn Taylor, a professor at Stanford who first suggested them. They give an estimate of\nan appropriate setting of the funds rate given where inflation is relative to an assumed\ntarget and a measure of tightness in goods or labor markets.\nTaken as a whole, a variety of these rules indicate that the funds rate is currently\nwithin the moderately restrictive range that appears appropriate. Current conditions in\n\ngoods markets generally suggest that the current policy stance is sufficient to bring\ninflation down to more acceptable levels. In view of what I’ve said today, it will come as\nno surprise that consideration of the situation in labor markets provides less room for\noptimism on inflation. And while I am inclined to see labor market tightness as\ntransitory, I do take it as a serious risk.\nEven if policy is now well positioned, as I think is likely to be the case, it will still\ntake some additional time for inflation to unwind due to lags between policy actions and\ntheir impacts on economic activity and inflation. These lags can be anywhere from\nseveral months to a couple of years. This means that we have yet to see the full effects of\nthe series of 17 funds rate increases—some are probably still in the pipeline.\nYou will note that I am casting my statements about the stance of policy and the\noutlook in very conditional terms. I do this because of the great uncertainty that\nsurrounds economic forecasts and any simple measure of the tightness of monetary\npolicy. Frankly, all approaches to assessing the stance of policy are inherently imprecise.\nJust as imprecise is our understanding of how long the lags will be between our policy\nactions and their impacts on the economy and inflation. This uncertainty argues, then, for\npolicy to be responsive to the data as it emerges, especially since we are within range of\nthe desired policy setting. The decision to keep policy on hold allows us more time to\nobserve the data so that appropriate adjustments can be made over time.\n# # #",

Yellen, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on Saturday, May 27, 2006, 9:00 PM Pacific Time\nMonetary Policy in a Global Environment\nMy topic tonight is globalization and the conduct of U.S. monetary policy. At issue is\nwhether globalization has altered the inflation process in the United States and, if so, whether\nsuch changes impair the Fed’s ability to assess the state of the economy or to conduct monetary\npolicy to achieve its dual objectives of price stability and full employment.\nProponents of the view that globalization has affected U.S. inflation commonly claim that\nit has resulted in disinflationary pressures over the last decade. For example, Alan Greenspan\nmade precisely this argument in Congressional testimony last year, citing the massive new\n“army” of workers that has become available to engage in the world’s markets—some 100\nmillion plus from the former Soviet bloc, some 750 million from China, and the growing\npowerhouse of talent that India’s workers represent.\nBeyond its direct impact on the level of U.S. inflation, proponents of this “new view”\ncontend that globalization has altered the dynamics of inflation—the linkages between current\ninflation, lagged inflation, domestic unemployment, and supply shocks that are summarized by\nthe Phillips curve. In particular, their view is that globalization has weakened the traditional link\nbetween domestic resource utilization and inflation: With prices increasingly set in global\nmarkets, firms have less room to pass on higher costs—whether due to wages, energy, or\nmaterials prices; instead, they have to do what they can to control costs, identify productivity\nimprovements to offset cost increases, and ultimately absorb any fluctuations in unit costs in\ntheir profit margins. As The Economist recently opined: “This makes a nonsense of traditional\n1\n\neconomic models of inflation, which virtually ignore globalization….”1 Some observers go\neven further, arguing that the slack that matters to inflation is not domestic slack but global\nslack.2\nMy objective in these remarks is to discuss several conceptually distinct channels through\nwhich globalization might affect the process of inflation in the United States, to assess some\nempirical evidence bearing on the strength of such linkages, and to reflect on the implications for\nmonetary policy.\nTo preview my conclusions, some very tentative evidence supports the proposition that\nincreasing global capacity, on balance, has held inflation down over the last decade. But, the\nmagnitude of the dampening effect appears to be modest, and exchange rate fluctuations,\npossibly related to other shocks, have played a significant role. There is also evidence that the\n(price-price) Phillips curve has become flatter—a phenomenon that may be related to\nglobalization.\nWith respect to monetary policy, I find nothing either in theory or the existing empirical\nevidence to overturn the conclusion that a country like the United States, operating under a\nflexible exchange rate regime, can ultimately achieve the inflation target of its choice. That said,\nglobal factors may impact inflation in the medium term, just as higher productivity growth is\nnow widely recognized to have put downward pressure on inflation during the second half of the\n1990s. And insofar as globalization has affected the dynamics of inflation—through changes in\nthe slope of the Phillips curve or the NAIRU (non-accelerating inflation rate of\n1 “A Foreign Affair,” The Economist, p. 81, October 20, 2005, print version.\n2\nRichard Fisher, “Globalization and Monetary Policy,” Warren and Anita Manshel Lecture in American Foreign\nPolicy, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass, November 3, 2005.\n2\n\nunemployment)—it may require some recalibration of policy responses.\nLinkages between globalization and inflation\nIn discussing how globalization potentially affects the inflationary process, it is common\nto focus on a number of distinct channels, and I will follow that approach here. However, I want\nto emphasize that, at least in some cases, these channels represent partial effects that may have\nrepercussions on other variables—such as the exchange rate—in a fully specified model.\nMovements in these other variables may materially affect one’s views on the impacts of\nglobalization. However, I will defer that consideration until I turn to assessing the interpretation\nof the empirical results in the literature.\nThe first channel is the most obvious one—the direct effect of the reductions in the prices\nof imported goods and services that may be caused by globalization, and which are included in\nthe indices of consumer prices that central banks commonly target.\nImport prices also could have indirect impacts on inflation. One such indirect linkage might\noperate through the labor market if nominal wage demands are influenced by the prices of\nimported consumer goods. The argument here is that a decline in the price of imports raises the\nreal reward to work, namely, the purchasing power of a given nominal wage. Such real wage\nincreases may raise labor supply. Alternatively stated, lower import prices could reduce\nworkers’ demands for nominal wage increases.\nAnother indirect channel reflects the possibility that lower import prices may restrain the\nprices charged by domestic producers of competing products. Increased global competition, as\nthe “new view” emphasizes, may have made the demand curve facing American producers more\n3\n\nelastic, resulting in larger feedbacks from lower import prices into core inflation. The now\nstandard practice of including import prices in the price-price or wage-price Phillips curve\nprovides a way to capture both direct and indirect linkages from import prices to domestic\ninflation.\nIn addition, this constraint on pricing ability could affect other parameters in Phillips\ncurves. This effect might operate in a couple of ways. First, when lower domestic\nunemployment leads to higher wage demands, firms may not be able to pass through the higher\ncosts, but must absorb them in their markups. As a result, a Phillips curve that expresses\ninflation as a function of slack, lagged inflation, and other variables (the so-called price-price\nPhillips curve) would become flatter—with a smaller response of inflation to measures of\nslack—as the “new view” emphasizes.3 This result would hold even if the response of wage\ngrowth to slack were unchanged.4\nHowever, it is also possible that globalization could reduce the sensitivity of domestic\nwages to changes in domestic labor market slack—in other words, it also could make the wage-\nprice Phillips curve flatter. Suppose, for example, that globalization has enhanced the\nopportunities for firms to substitute imports for domestic output. This could occur in part\nbecause firms operating plants in several countries may be able to shift production from plants in\nthe U.S. to those in lower-cost countries. As such opportunities for substitution increase, firms\nmight become less willing to grant wage increases that would impair their cost competitiveness,\neven in the face of tight domestic labor markets. Such substitution effectively increases the\n3 As a result, markups would show stronger cyclical variation.\n4 For an analysis of how greater openness and increasing elasticity of substitution can affect the slope of the Phillips\ncurve, see Richard Clarida, Jordi Gali, and Mark Gertler, “Optimal Monetary Policy in Open versus Closed\n4\n\ndegree of competition between domestic and foreign workers. In the limit—when such\nsubstitution in effect creates a single global labor market—it could be that global, not domestic,\nlabor market slack explains changes in U.S. wages and inflation.\nA distinct but related possibility is that globalization may be undermining the bargaining\npower of U.S. workers, making them more fearful of job loss, thus lowering wage demands and\nholding inflation down. This might show up as a downward shift in the Phillips curve, similar to\nthe impact of more rapid productivity growth in the second half of the 1990s. However,\nglobalization is but one of several structural shifts that may have deepened worker insecurity,\nespecially among less-skilled workers.5 These shifts include increased use of domestic\noutsourcing and skill-biased technological changes that have decreased the demand for less-\nskilled workers and constrained their wages in most sectors of the U.S. economy. Alternatively,\nglobalization, coupled with technological change, may simultaneously have raised the bargaining\npower of many skilled workers with opposite effects on the Phillips curve.\nA final linkage from globalization to inflation worth noting pertains to productivity. Some\nhave argued that increased global competition has raised firms’ incentives to innovate and their\nability to achieve productivity improvements in part via foreign outsourcing of intermediate\ngoods, IT services, and back-office functions. Productivity growth (or its change), as we saw\nduring the boom of the 1990s, may affect the dynamics of inflation. In essence, faster\nproductivity growth matters to inflation, at least for a time, because it holds down cost pressures.\nStated differently, more rapid productivity improvements make it easier for firms to satisfy\nEconomies: An Integrated Approach,” American Economic Review, Vol. 91, No. 2, (May 2001), pp. 248 252.\n5 A model that captures many of the factors described here is in Charles R. Bean, “European Unemployment: A\nSurvey,” Journal of Economic Literature, Vol. 32, No. 2 (June 1994), pp. 573-619.\n5\n\nworkers’ aspirations for real wage gains. Faster productivity growth thus tends to lower inflation\nunless or until workers real wage aspirations rise to match the productivity gains.\nEvidence from import prices\nSeveral recent studies, employing different empirical strategies, have attempted to assess\nthe magnitude of direct and indirect linkages between import prices and inflation for the U.S.\nand other industrial countries.\nFor example, a recent IMF (International Monetary Fund) analysis estimates (price-price)\nPhillips curve relations for a panel of eight industrial countries, including the U.S.6 The study\nfinds that the slower rise in relative import prices in recent years has had only a fairly small\nimpact on overall inflation.7 For the U.S., the study estimates that a 1 percent decline in relative\nimport prices lowers CPI inflation by only 15 basis points after one year and 6 basis points after\nthree years. Based on such estimates, the IMF calculates that non-oil import price reductions\nlowered U.S. inflation by an average of ½ percentage point a year over 1997 to 2005.8 These\nresults are in line with those from a recent analysis at the Federal Reserve Board that estimates\nthat lower (core) import prices have reduced core U.S. inflation by an annual average of ½ to 1\npercentage point over the past 10 years.9\n6 IMF World Economic Outlook, April 2006, Ch.3\n7 Since the 1960s, U.S. import prices, both core and overall, have risen at about the same annual rate as consumer\nprices—roughly 4 percent. But since 1997, core import prices (excluding petroleum, natural gas, computers, and\nsemiconductors) have risen only 0.4 percent per year, versus 1.7 percent for core consumer prices (PCE price index).\n8 The IMF’s counterfactual calculations assume that relative non-oil import prices moved during the 1997-2005 period\nin line with an historical trend decline of 1.6 percent per year. Note, however, that this decline reflects the inclusion of\ncomputers and semi-conductors; if those elements are removed, as they are in the Federal Reserve Board’s measure\nof core import prices, then there is no trend decline.\n9 Cited in Donald L. Kohn, \"Globalization, Inflation, and Monetary Policy,\" remarks delivered at the James R.\nWilson Lecture Series, The College of Wooster, Wooster, Ohio, October 11, 2005.\n6\n\nAnother empirical strategy that has been used to identify possible indirect effects of\nglobalization on pricing by domestic producers involves the use of sectoral data. The IMF study\nI mentioned is representative. It finds that a 10 percent increase in a sector’s import ratio—that\nis, the ratio of imports to domestic production—reduces its price relative to an index of\naggregate producer prices by 1 percent. There is also some limited evidence that manufacturing\nsectors with rising import shares experienced lesser increases in domestic unit labor costs and\nintermediate goods costs than the average industry. This result is consistent with the hypothesis\nthat globalization is holding down wages in some industries and outsourcing may be lowering\nthe costs of intermediate goods. Nevertheless, the estimated magnitude of the effects of\nopenness on producer prices is still rather small. Thus in manufacturing, which has perhaps been\nmost impacted by globalization, the IMF estimates that increased trade openness has reduced\nrelative producer prices by 0.3 percent per year between 1987 and 2003.\nIn light of China’s rapidly growing economy and exports and the limited flexibility of its\nexchange rate against the dollar, proponents of the “new view” commonly single that country out\nas a source of global disinflationary pressures. However, a Federal Reserve Board study\nfocusing on the specific impact of China on U.S. prices finds only modest effects.10 It estimates\nthat a rise in China’s share of imports in a particular sector lowers U.S. import prices, but this\neffect is not substantial. The results imply that the roughly 0.6 percentage point per year rise in\nChina’s share of U.S. imports since 1993 has lowered U.S. import inflation by about 0.8\npercentage point per year. With imports now only about 16 percent of U.S. GDP (in nominal\nterms), this translates into an annual decline in U.S. consumer prices of about 0.1 percentage\n10 Steven Kamin, Mario Marazzi, and John Schindler, “Is China ‘Exporting Deflation’?” Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve, International Finance Discussion Paper 2004-791.\n7\n\npoint. This study finds no evidence of indirect effects of Chinese import prices on U.S. producer\nprices.\nThe array of evidence I have summarized thus far suggests that foreign factors have had\nsome impact on U.S. prices—an impact that may be increasing—but overall it has been\nrather limited. Such findings should not come as a great surprise. Despite the growing trend\ntoward integration, the U.S. is far—very far—from being fully integrated with the rest of the\nworld’s markets. As I just mentioned, imports still amount to a fairly small fraction of U.S.\nGDP. In addition, many U.S. goods are not traded, and despite stories about U.S. firms hiring\nprogrammers in Bangalore and typesetters in Beijing, they still have to “buy American” when it\ncomes to a host of other services and trades, such as health care, entertainment, and construction.\nThe prices of these non-traded goods and services, which represent the large majority of\ndomestic consumption, are not directly affected by foreign price developments. Therefore,\ndomestic price developments arguably still weigh far more heavily in the overall domestic price\nlevel than do foreign price developments.\nMoreover, the evidence of small foreign effects that I’ve discussed may actually overstate\nthe true effects of globalization. The reason has to do with exchange rate adjustments. It might\nseem obvious that if low-wage countries like China and India have a growing capacity to supply\nlabor-intensive goods to global markets, that would produce a persistent downward trend in the\ndollar prices of U.S. imports. However, the dollar prices of imported goods reflect not only the\nselling price of these goods in foreign currencies but also movements in the value of the dollar\nvis-à-vis those currencies. In many theoretical models of an open economy with flexible\nexchange rates, however, a country’s real exchange rate and its import prices are not ultimately\n8\n\ndetermined by foreign price trends. In simple models, changes in the foreign currency prices of\nimports tend to be offset by movements in the exchange rate, leaving domestic import prices\nunchanged. In other words, a flexible exchange rate hypothetically shields a country from the\ndirect effects of globalization.\nFurthermore, the fluctuations that we have observed in import prices—fluctuations which\nthe Phillips curve studies I’ve discussed implicitly attribute to greater world capacity—may\nactually have resulted from conceptually distinct causes, such as “capital account shocks”\naffecting global capital flows. For example, an appreciation of the dollar, and a corresponding\nreduction in import prices, would be expected in the aftermath of a shock that widens the gap\nbetween desired foreign saving and investment. Such a shock arguably occurred in the wake of\nthe global financial crisis in 1997-98 and as a consequence of Japan’s banking crisis. An\nincrease in the return to investment in the U.S. could similarly have induced capital inflows that\nappreciated the dollar.11\nIn support of the view that import price movements have actually been driven at least in\npart by factors unrelated to “globalization,” the Board study I mentioned finds that movements in\nexchange rates have been at least as important as movements in the foreign currency prices of\nimported goods in accounting for fluctuations in U.S. import prices.12 The importance of\nexchange rate fluctuations as a source of variation in import prices explains why the IMF study\nfinds large year to year variability in the impact of import prices on inflation. According to their\nestimates, significant declines in non-oil import prices, largely due to the appreciation of the\n11 For a fuller discussion of these points and their implications for the U.S. current account deficit, see Ben S.\nBernanke, “The Global Saving Glut and the U.S. Current Account Deficit,” remarks delivered at the Homer Jones\nLecture, St. Louis Missouri, April 14, 2005.\n9\n\ndollar, held down U.S. inflation by about 1 percentage point during 1998-1999, following the\nAsian financial crisis, and by ¾ percentage point during the 2001-02 global slowdown.13 Such\nmovements in the dollar are neither simply nor obviously related to the growing global capacity\noften cited by proponents of the “new view.”\nOther findings\nI have thus far summarized the findings of studies that attempt to gauge the direct and\nindirect effects of import price movements on inflation. As I noted earlier, globalization could\nalso affect the Phillips curve in other ways. Unfortunately, research bearing on some of the\nlinkages I discussed is scanty. But a review of the literature suggests that there is substantial\nempirical evidence supporting the “new view” conclusion that the (price-price) Phillips curve\nhas flattened. The evidence pertains to the U.S. and also to other industrial countries.\nFor example, a study at the Federal Reserve Board finds that the responsiveness of U.S.\ninflation to measures of domestic capacity has fallen by roughly a third since the mid-1980s.14\nThe IMF study cited earlier finds a similar result for the eight advanced countries, including the\nU.S., in their sample. While the empirical finding of a flatter Phillips curve appears pervasive,\nthis result could be open to differing interpretations. The IMF study presents evidence\nsuggesting that greater openness explains over half of this reduced sensitivity.\nA BIS (Bank for International Settlements) study attempts to sort out the relative\n12 Kohn, op. cit.\n13 It should be noted that in the case of the U.S. the impact of lower foreign prices during this time was augmented\nby an appreciating dollar, part of which may have endogenously reflected currency depreciations by emerging\nmarkets needing to improve their current account balances.\n14 See John Roberts, “Monetary Policy and Inflation Dynamics,” Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, Finance and Economics Discussion Paper 2004-62, 2004.\n10\n\nimportance of domestic and global capacity pressures by including both measures in Phillips\ncurve equations for a sample of 16 countries.15 It finds that a measure of world capacity is\nsignificant in explaining inflation and reduces the effect of domestic capacity on inflation.\nTaken at face value, this analysis implies that inflationary pressures could remain contained in\ncountries where domestic resources are fully or more than fully employed as long as there is\nexcess capacity in the global economy.\nHowever, I would need to see more evidence to be convinced of this result. The use of\naggregate Phillips curve methodology to analyze national wage and price trends is commonly\njustified by the assumption that labor and capital are sufficiently mobile across localities and\nregions in a single country to justify the vastly simplifying assumption of a single national labor\nmarket. Measures of sectoral shifts are sometimes included as an additional variable in the\nPhillips curve because such an assumption is stretched, even in the case of a single country. But\nif the assumption of perfect labor mobility seems stretched at the national level, it remains far,\nfar less plausible at the global level. I would urge additional research to assess its robustness and\nclarify its appropriate interpretation.\nMoreover, San Francisco Fed staff found that measures of world capacity are not\nsignificant when added to the Phillips curves that they use to forecast inflation, and that the usual\nmeasures of domestic labor and product market slack retain their significance. In addition, the\nstaff examined a wage-price Phillips curve and found no change in the coefficient on the\nunemployment rate in recent years. In other words, this exercise also suggests that domestic\nslack plays about the same role in the inflation process as it did previously. As I indicated in my\n15 Claudio Borio and Andrew Filardo, “Globalisation and Inflation: New Cross-Country Evidence on the Global\nDeterminants of Domestic Inflation,” mimeo, BIS, March 2006.\n11\n\ndiscussion of possible linkages from globalization to U.S. inflation, the result also suggests that,\ninsofar as globalization has led to a flatter price-price Phillips curve, it is more likely to have\ndone so through changes in firms’ ability to mark up costs in setting prices than through changes\nin the effects of domestic slack on wage growth.\nImplications for monetary policy\nLet me now turn to the final portion of my remarks and attempt a response to the question:\nWhat implications does globalization have for the Fed’s conduct of monetary policy? My main\nconclusion is that globalization has no impact on the Fed’s ability to control inflation in the long\nrun, although structural shifts associated with globalization could, in principle, affect the\nNAIRU, the level of labor market slack associated with price stability. That said, I am not aware\nof persuasive evidence that it has done so. However, globalization may have an effect on\nwage/price dynamics and, as such, may require that monetary policy be recalibrated to take these\nchanges into account, much as was required in the latter half of the 1990s in response to the surge\nin productivity growth.\nSince the focus of so much empirical work pertaining to globalization centers on import\nprices, it seems logical to begin by considering the consequences of import price shocks for\nmonetary policy. The implications are straightforward, because changes in the prices of\nimported goods, whatever their cause, are akin from a policy perspective to other “supply\nshocks,” such as a change in the price of oil. Ever since the 1970s, such “shocks” have routinely\nbeen incorporated in the Phillips curve models used to forecast inflation, and their policy\nimplications are well understood. The consensus among economists is that “one-shot” changes\nin the prices of imported commodities, such as oil, impact inflation for a time, but not\n12\n\npermanently, unless they touch off a change in inflation expectations, setting off a wage-price\nspiral as in the 1970s. Appropriate policy actions by the Fed—a credible commitment to price\nstability consistently backed by actions to anchor inflation to price stability—are essential to\nensure that such supply shocks do not become embedded in inflation expectations. The Fed has\nlearned a great deal since the 1970s about the dangers such shocks pose to inflation outcomes\nabsent appropriate monetary policies and a commitment to price stability. Indeed, the Fed by\nnow has established such a strong and credible record that empirical evidence suggests that there\nhas actually been less spillover of import prices, including energy prices, into core inflation since\nthe mid-1980s\nIt is conceivable, of course, that the forces associated with globalization might result not\nin “one-shot” type shifts, affecting the level of relative import prices over a short period, but a\ntendency instead for upward or downward pressures over a prolonged period. Such long-lasting\nshifts in the relative price of imports would create tailwinds for policymakers—if, for example,\nrapid growth in global supply places prolonged downward pressure on import prices—or\nheadwinds, if, for example, strong global growth instead produces a chronic upward trend in\nrelative commodity prices. The possibility of prolonged downward pressure on import prices\ndue to the integration of China and other emerging markets in the global economy is presumably\nwhat Greenspan and others have in mind when they describe globalization as a disinflationary\nforce. As the logic of the Phillips curve makes apparent, such long-lasting shifts in\nimport prices would indeed require the Fed to adjust its monetary policy to keep overall\ninflation in the vicinity of the Fed’s preferred target. To combat the “headwinds” associated\nwith chronically rising import prices, monetary policy must be tighter, which entails greater\n13\n\nslack in the labor market. Tailwinds due to falling import prices, in contrast, lower the degree of\nslack required to attain a fixed inflation objective. It is in this sense that ongoing negative\nsupply shocks raise the NAIRU, while ongoing positive supply shocks lower the NAIRU.\nA continued and pronounced downward trend in relative import prices would impact the\nU.S. inflation process in a manner akin to the productivity speedup in the 1990s—a prolonged,\npositive supply shock from a Phillips curve perspective. Indeed, some have hypothesized that\nglobalization may actually have spurred some of the innovations that caused productivity to\nsurge. More rapid productivity growth, which the U.S. still enjoys, enabled the Fed to keep\nunemployment at extraordinarily low levels for an extended period while simultaneously\nbringing inflation down to levels consistent with price stability. The productivity speedup,\ncoupled, in fact, with a marked reduction in import prices associated with the appreciation of the\ndollar in the latter half of the 1990s, made the Fed’s job a great deal easier.\nIn addition to linkages to inflation that operate through the channel of import prices, my\nearlier discussion highlighted the possibility that globalization could account for the flatter\n(price-price) Phillips curve. To my mind, such changes in the slope of the Phillips curve have no\nobvious implications for the Fed’s ability to achieve its dual objectives of price stability and full\nemployment.16 However, a flatter Phillips curve could complicate the Fed’s job by making\npolicy errors both easier to commit and more costly to repair. Reduced sensitivity of inflation to\ndomestic unemployment means that emerging inflationary pressures take longer to become\nevident and are more difficult to discern. As a consequence, the Fed might be tempted to let\n16 In the limiting case in which domestic inflation is completely unresponsive to movements in domestic slack, Fed-\nengineered changes in aggregate demand would have no direct impact on inflation, nullifying the normal mechanism\nby which the Fed controls inflation. However, tighter monetary policy would likely still affect inflation directly, to\nthe extent that interest rate differentials induce capital flows that appreciate the exchange rate.\n14\n\nthese pressures build up, taking comfort from the fact that the inflationary consequences appear\nto be small or nonexistent. Such reasoning is misguided, however, because reduced sensitivity\nof inflation to slack simultaneously raises the sacrifice ratio, which is the cost of restoring price\nstability once inflation has unacceptably risen.\nI have implicitly assumed in my discussion so far that the Fed’s ability to influence\naggregate demand and thereby inflation is unaffected by globalization. This assumption\narguably requires some defense because the growing integration of capital markets—another\naspect of globalization—has increased the sensitivity of global capital flows to interest rate\ndifferentials and expectations concerning exchange rate movements. Do linkages among interest\nrates rob monetary policy of its power to affect demand? My answer to this question is no. I\nbase it on both economic theory and the evidence. Of critical importance to the effectiveness of\nmonetary policy with highly integrated global capital markets is that the U.S. operates under a\nregime of flexible, not fixed, exchange rates. Under a fixed rate regime, the Fed would indeed\nhave little or no scope to influence spending. For example, a contractionary open market\noperation intended to decrease bank reserves and raise domestic interest rates, thereby inhibiting\nspending, would induce capital inflows forcing the Fed to defend its currency peg by acquiring\nforeign exchange. Such offsetting exchange reserve flows add to bank reserves, in effect\nnullifying the original policy action.\nA flexible exchange rate regime makes a world of difference to monetary policy. Free of\nthe obligation to defend any currency peg, the Fed retains control over its monetary base. Since\nthe U.S. is a large player in the global economy and in capital markets, U.S. monetary policy\ncommonly impacts both interest rates and the value of the dollar. Repercussions of monetary\n15\n\npolicy on the dollar typically occur to the extent that capital flows are sensitive to global interest\nrate differentials. The transmission mechanism for U.S. monetary policy operates through both\nchannels of influence which work in tandem to affect aggregate demand. The tendency of the\ndollar to appreciate in response to a tighter monetary policy also creates a direct link to inflation\nvia lower import prices.\nFrom the perspective of monetary policy, there is one notable asymmetry affecting the\nFed’s ability to combat any “headwinds” or “tailwinds” associated with globalization. The\nasymmetry results from the so-called zero bound on nominal interest rates—which sets a lower\nlimit on the federal funds rate below which it cannot go should the Fed need to stimulate the\neconomy to counter deflation. With sufficiently intense deflationary “tailwinds,” the Fed could\nconceivably exhaust its scope for response, at least using conventional policy approaches. In\nfact such risks became palpable in 2003—for the first time in half a century. This episode\nstimulated not only thoughtful policy research but also a creative and constructive response on\nthe part of the Fed.\nI will conclude by summarizing the main themes in this talk and emphasizing the value of\nadditional research. The evidence I reviewed suggests that shifts in the relative price of\nimports—one mechanism through which globalization might affect U.S. inflation performance—\nhave thus far been relatively modest. Evidence also suggests that the Phillips curve has\nflattened, a phenomenon that could be related to globalization. There are a number of additional\nchannels through which structural changes associated with globalization could affect labor and\nproduct markets, and these changes could, in turn, alter the NAIRU, possibly for an extended\ntime. Unfortunately, existing evidence pertaining to the operation of these various linkages is\n16\n\nscanty or nonexistent. To the best of my knowledge, econometric estimates of the U.S. Phillips\ncurve provide no obvious evidence of any pronounced shift in the NAIRU in recent years.\nFrom the perspective of monetary policy, globalization does matter. Shocks and persistent\neconomic trends associated with America’s involvement in the global economy must be factored\ninto the design of an appropriate monetary policy. Even so, globalization does nothing to\nimperil the Fed’s ability to attain its inflation objectives. We still have a lot to learn about the\nmechanisms through which globalization is impacting the U.S. economy. As the globalization\ntrend unfolds, we policymakers will turn to you, our colleagues in the economics profession, for\nthe best in theory and evidence to guide us.\n17",

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Philip Gamble Memorial Lecture\nUniversity of Massachusetts, Amherst\nAmherst, Massachusetts\nSeptember 24, 2015\n\nI would like to thank Michael Ash for his kind introduction and the University of\nMassachusetts for the honor of being invited to deliver this year’s Philip Gamble\nMemorial Lecture.\nIn my remarks today, I will discuss inflation and its role in the Federal Reserve’s\nconduct of monetary policy. I will begin by reviewing the history of inflation in the\nUnited States since the 1960s, highlighting two key points: that inflation is now much\nmore stable than it used to be, and that it is currently running at a very low level. I will\nthen consider the costs associated with inflation, and why these costs suggest that the\nFederal Reserve should try to keep inflation close to 2 percent. After briefly reviewing\nour policy actions since the financial crisis, I will discuss the dynamics of inflation and\ntheir implications for the outlook and monetary policy.\nHistorical Review of Inflation\nA crucial responsibility of any central bank is to control inflation, the average rate\nof increase in the prices of a broad group of goods and services. Keeping inflation stable\nat a moderately low level is important because, for reasons I will discuss, inflation that is\nhigh, excessively low, or unstable imposes significant costs on households and\nbusinesses. As a result, inflation control is one half of the dual mandate that Congress\nhas laid down for the Federal Reserve, which is to pursue maximum employment and\nstable prices.\nThe Federal Reserve has not always been successful in fulfilling the price stability\nelement of its mandate. The dashed red line in figure 1 plots the four-quarter percent\nchange in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)--the measure of\ninflation that the Fed’s policymaking body, the Federal Open Market Committee, or\n\n- 2 -\nFOMC, uses to define its longer-run inflation goal.1 Starting in the mid-1960s, inflation\nbegan to move higher. Large jumps in food and energy prices played a role in this\nupward move, but they were not the whole story, for, as illustrated here, inflation was\nalready moving up before the food and energy shocks hit in the 1970s and the early\n1980s.2 And if we look at core inflation, the solid black line, which excludes food and\nenergy prices, we see that it too starts to move higher in the mid-1960s and rises to very\nelevated levels during the 1970s, which strongly suggests that something more than the\nenergy and food price shocks must have been at work.\nA second important feature of inflation over this period can be seen if we examine\nan estimate of its long-term trend, which is plotted as the dotted black line in figure 1. At\neach point in time, this trend is defined as the prediction from a statistical model of the\nlevel to which inflation is projected to return in the long run once the effects of any\nshocks to the economy have fully played out.3 As can be seen from the figure, this\nestimated trend drifts higher over the 1960s and 1970s, implying that during this period\n1 See the Federal Open Market Committee’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy\nStrategy, available on the Board’s website at\nwww.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf.\n2 The first jump in energy prices in the 1970s reflected a rise in crude oil prices whose proximate cause was\nthe so-called Arab oil embargo that followed the 1973 Arab-Israeli War; the first jump in food prices was\ncaused by disease and poor harvests combined with low levels of inventories (particularly for grains) in\nmany countries. The second energy price shock resulted from a jump in crude oil prices following the\n1978-79 revolution in Iran and subsequent Iraqi invasion; the second food price shock was largely\nattributable to bad weather and disease. (See Blinder and Rudd, 2013, for an assessment of the effect that\nthese and other special factors--including the imposition and removal of price controls over the 1971-74\nperiod--had on consumer price inflation in the 1970s and 1980s.)\n3 The predicted long-run trend shown here updates an estimate made by Peneva and Rudd (2015), which\nuses a vector autoregression (VAR) with time-varying parameters and stochastic volatility to compute a\nstochastic trend for inflation (see that paper for additional details regarding model specification and data\ndefinitions). The estimation procedure for the VAR is similar to that used by Clark and Terry (2010),\nwhich in turn follows Cogley and Sargent (2005); see also Cogley and others (2010) and Ascari and\nSbordone (2014) for related applications.\n\n- 3 -\nthere was no stable “anchor” to which inflation could be expected to eventually return--a\nconclusion generally supported by other procedures for estimating trend inflation.\nToday many economists believe that these features of inflation in the late 1960s\nand 1970s--its high level and lack of a stable anchor--reflected a combination of factors,\nincluding chronically overheated labor and product markets, the effects of the energy and\nfood price shocks, and the emergence of an “inflationary psychology” whereby a rise in\nactual inflation led people to revise up their expectations for future inflation. Together,\nthese various factors caused inflation--actual and expected--to ratchet higher over time.\nUltimately, however, monetary policy bears responsibility for the broad contour of what\nhappened to actual and expected inflation during this period because the Federal Reserve\nwas insufficiently focused on returning inflation to a predictable, low level following the\nshocks to food and energy prices and other disturbances.\nIn late 1979, the Federal Reserve began significantly tightening monetary policy\nto reduce inflation. In response to this tightening, which precipitated a severe economic\ndownturn in the early 1980s, overall inflation moved persistently lower, averaging less\nthan 4 percent from 1983 to 1990. Inflation came down further following the 1990-91\nrecession and subsequent slow recovery and then averaged about 2 percent for many\nyears. Since the recession ended in 2009, however, the United States has experienced\ninflation running appreciably below the FOMC’s 2 percent objective, in part reflecting\nthe gradual pace of the subsequent economic recovery.\nExamining the behavior of inflation’s estimated long-term trend reveals another\nimportant change in inflation dynamics. With the caveat that these results are based on a\nspecific implementation of a particular statistical model, they imply that since the mid-\n\n- 4 -\n1990s there have been no persistent movements in this predicted long-run inflation rate,\nwhich has remained very close to 2 percent. Remarkably, this stability is estimated to\nhave continued during and after the recent severe recession, which saw the\nunemployment rate rise to levels comparable to those seen during the 1981-82 downturn,\nwhen the trend did shift down markedly.4 As I will discuss, the stability of this trend\nappears linked to a change in the behavior of long-run inflation expectations--measures of\nwhich appear to be much better anchored today than in the past, likely reflecting an\nimprovement in the conduct of monetary policy. In any event, this empirical analysis\nimplies that, over the past 20 years, inflation has been much more predictable over the\nlonger term than it was back in the 1970s because the trend rate to which inflation was\npredicted to return no longer moved around appreciably. That said, inflation still varied\nconsiderably from year to year in response to various shocks.\nAs figure 2 highlights, the United States has experienced very low inflation on\naverage since the financial crisis, in part reflecting persistent economic weakness that has\nproven difficult to fully counter with monetary policy. Overall inflation (shown as the\ndashed red line) has averaged only about 1-1/2 percent per year since 2008 and is\ncurrently close to zero. This result is not merely a product of falling energy prices, as\ncore inflation (the solid black line) has also been low on average over this period.\nInflation Costs\nIn 2012 the FOMC adopted, for the first time, an explicit longer-run inflation\nobjective of 2 percent as measured by the PCE price index.5 (Other central banks,\n4 Trend inflation estimates from univariate statistical models manifest somewhat less stability in recent\nyears; see Clark and Bednar (2015).\n5 In contrast, the FOMC has determined that a number of considerations preclude it from setting a fixed\nnumerical target for the other leg of its dual mandate, maximum employment. As discussed in its\n\n- 5 -\nincluding the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, also have a 2 percent\ninflation target.) This decision reflected the FOMC’s judgment that inflation that\npersistently deviates--up or down--from a fixed low level can be costly in a number of\nways. Persistent high inflation induces households and firms to spend time and effort\ntrying to minimize their cash holdings and forces businesses to adjust prices more\nfrequently than would otherwise be necessary. More importantly, high inflation also\ntends to raise the after-tax cost of capital, thereby discouraging business investment.\nThese adverse effects occur because capital depreciation allowances and other aspects of\nour tax system are only partially indexed for inflation.6\nPersistently high inflation, if unanticipated, can be especially costly for\nhouseholds that rely on pensions, annuities, and long-term bonds to provide a significant\nportion of their retirement income. Because the income provided by these assets is\ntypically fixed in nominal terms, its real purchasing power may decline surprisingly\nquickly if inflation turns out to be consistently higher than originally anticipated, with\npotentially serious consequences for retirees’ standard of living as they age.7\nStatement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy (see note 1), the maximum level of\nemployment is something that is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and\ndynamics of the labor market. Moreover, the maximum level of employment, the longer-run “natural” rate\nof unemployment, and other related aspects of the labor market are not directly observable, can change\nover time, and can only be estimated imprecisely. As a result, views vary about what labor market\nconditions would be consistent with a normal level of resource utilization.\n6 For a general survey of the costs of high inflation, see Briault (1995). English (1999) discusses costs\nassociated with an increased need for cash management. For a discussion of costs that arise through\ninteractions of inflation with the tax system, see Feldstein (1997, 1999) and Cohen and others (1999).\nFinally, high inflation may adversely affect the economy’s allocation of resources by increasing the\nmagnitude of misalignments in relative prices that result because firms do not continually adjust all of their\nprices; for a discussion of such costs in the context of the new-Keynesian model of inflation, see Ascari and\nSbordone (2014).\n7 More broadly, if inflation evolves in an unpredictable manner over many years, then even financially\nsophisticated households and firms may not be able to avoid significant forecasting errors with their\nattendant costs. Such costs can arise in a wide variety of situations; for instance, any firm, union, or other\nentity that engages in a multiyear nominal contract may be adversely affected by unexpected increases or\ndecreases in inflation, although those on the other side of the contract might benefit.\n\n- 6 -\nAn unexpected rise in inflation also tends to reduce the real purchasing power of\nlabor income for a time because nominal wages and salaries are generally slow to adjust\nto movements in the overall level of prices. Survey data suggest that this effect is\nprobably the number one reason why people dislike inflation so much.8 In the longer run,\nhowever, real wages--that is, wages adjusted for inflation--appear to be largely\nindependent of the average rate of inflation and instead are primarily determined by\nproductivity, global competition, and other nonmonetary factors. In support of this view,\nfigure 3 shows that nominal wage growth tends to broadly track price inflation over long\nperiods of time.\nInflation that is persistently very low can also be costly, and it is such costs that\nhave been particularly relevant to monetary policymakers in recent years. The most\nimportant cost is that very low inflation constrains a central bank’s ability to combat\nrecessions. Normally, the FOMC fights economic downturns by reducing the nominal\nfederal funds rate, the rate charged by banks to lend to each other overnight. These\nreductions, current and expected, stimulate spending and hiring by lowering longer-term\nreal interest rates--that is, nominal rates adjusted for inflation--and improving financial\nconditions more broadly. But the federal funds rate and other nominal interest rates\ncannot go much below zero, since holding cash is always an alternative to investing in\nsecurities.9 Thus, the lowest the FOMC can feasibly push the real federal funds rate is\nessentially the negative value of the inflation rate. As a result, the Federal Reserve has\n8 For more on this survey, see Shiller (1997).\n9 Because of the inconvenience of storing and protecting very large quantities of currency, some firms are\nwilling to pay a premium to hold short-term government securities or bank deposits instead. As a result,\nseveral foreign central banks have found it possible to push nominal short-term interest rates somewhat\nbelow zero.\n\n- 7 -\nless room to ease monetary policy when inflation is very low. This limitation is a\npotentially serious problem because severe downturns such as the Great Recession may\nrequire pushing real interest rates far below zero for an extended period to restore full\nemployment at a satisfactory pace.10 For this reason, pursuing too low an inflation\nobjective or otherwise tolerating persistently very low inflation would be inconsistent\nwith the other leg of the FOMC’s mandate, to promote maximum employment.11\nAn unexpected decline in inflation that is sizable and persistent can also be costly\nbecause it increases the debt burdens of borrowers. Consider homeowners who take out a\nconventional fixed-rate mortgage, with the expectation that inflation will remain close to\n2 percent and their nominal incomes will rise about 4 percent per year. If the economy\nwere instead to experience chronic mild deflation accompanied by flat or declining\nnominal incomes, then after a few years the homeowners might find it noticeably more\ndifficult to cover their monthly mortgage payments than they had originally anticipated.\nMoreover, if house prices fall in line with consumer prices rather than rising as expected,\nthen the equity in their home will be lower than they had anticipated. This situation,\nwhich is sometimes referred to as “debt deflation,” would also confront all households\nwith outstanding student loans, auto loans, or credit card debt, as well as businesses that\n10 For example, Curdia and others (2014) estimate that stabilizing the economy during the last recession\nwould have required lowering the real federal funds rate to negative 10 percent for a time; by comparison,\nthe average value of the real federal funds has been only negative 1-1/4 percent since early 2009. Of\ncourse, the FOMC was able to use other policy tools, such as large-scale asset purchases, to put additional\ndownward pressure on long-term interest rates after the nominal funds rate was cut to near zero; however,\nthose policies had potential costs and risks that made them an imperfect substitute for traditional interest\nrate policy. See Krugman (1998), Reifschneider and Williams (2000), and Eggertsson and Woodford\n(2003) for discussions of the effects that low inflation and the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates\nhave on a central bank’s ability to stimulate the economy during economic downturns. In addition, see\nEnglish, Lopez-Salido, and Tetlow (2015) and Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015) for model-based\nanalyses of the effectiveness of the Federal Reserve’s large-scale asset purchases and forward guidance in\nmitigating the effects of the zero lower bound. Finally, for a discussion of the costs and benefits of\nemploying large scale asset purchases, see Bernanke (2012) and Yellen (2013).\n11 For a further discussion of this point, see Mishkin (2007).\n\n- 8 -\nhad taken out bank loans or issued bonds.12 Of course, in this situation, lenders would be\nreceiving more real income. But the net effect on the economy is likely to be negative, in\nlarge part because borrowers typically have only a limited ability to absorb losses. And if\nthe increased debt-service burdens and declines in collateral values are severe enough to\nforce borrowers into bankruptcy, then the resultant hardship imposed on families, small\nbusiness owners, and laid-off workers may be very severe.13\nMonetary Policy Actions since the Financial Crisis\nAs I noted earlier, after weighing the costs associated with various rates of\ninflation, the FOMC decided that 2 percent inflation is an appropriate operational\ndefinition of its longer-run price objective.14 In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis,\n12 See Fisher (1933) for an early discussion of debt deflation and its effects on the economy.\n13 Very low inflation also can result in chronically higher unemployment by closing off an important way in\nwhich the labor market can respond to adverse shocks. In sectors where productivity is lagging or demand\nis slowing, declines in real wages might be necessary to avoid even worse outcomes, such as layoffs. For\nvarious reasons, however, employers often try to avoid nominal wage cuts. (Bewley (1999) suggests a\nnumber of reasons that firms find cutting nominal wages difficult, including the effect that such cuts have\non employee morale. Inflation is therefore often said to “grease the wheels of the labor market” because it\npermits these required adjustments in real wages to occur through a combination of unchanged nominal\nwages and rising prices.) But when inflation falls to a very low level, this passive approach to wage\nreductions may no longer be viable for many firms, causing relatively more of the burden of adjustment to\nfall on employment.\n14 Blanchard, Dell’Ariccia and Mauro (2010), among others, have recently suggested that central banks\nshould consider raising their inflation targets, on the grounds that conditions since the financial crisis have\ndemonstrated that monetary policy is more constrained by the effective lower bound (ELB) on nominal\ninterest rates than was originally estimated. Ball (2013), for example, has proposed 4 percent as a more\nappropriate target for the FOMC. While it is certainly true that earlier analyses of ELB costs significantly\nunderestimated the likelihood of severe recessions and slow recoveries of the sort recently experienced in\nthe United States and elsewhere (see Chung and others, 2012), it is also the case that these analyses did not\ntake into account central banks’ ability to use large-scale asset purchases and other unconventional tools to\nmitigate the costs arising from the ELB constraint. In addition, it is not obvious that a modestly higher\ntarget rate of inflation would have greatly increased the Federal Reserve’s ability to support real activity in\nthe special conditions that prevailed in the wake of the financial crisis, when some of the channels through\nwhich lower interest rates stimulate aggregate spending, such as housing construction, were probably\nattenuated. Beyond these tactical considerations, however, changing the FOMC’s long-run inflation\nobjective would risk calling into question the FOMC’s commitment to stabilizing inflation at any level\nbecause it might lead people to suspect that the target could be changed opportunistically in the future. If\nso, then the key benefits of stable inflation expectations discussed below--an increased ability of monetary\npolicy to fight economic downturns without sacrificing price stability--might be lost. Moreover, if the\npurpose of a higher inflation target is to increase the ability of central banks to deal with the severe\nrecessions that follow financial crises, then a better strategic approach might be to rely on more vigorous\nsupervisory and macroprudential policies to reduce the likelihood of such events. Finally, targeting\n\n- 9 -\nhowever, achieving both this objective and full employment (the other leg of the Federal\nReserve’s dual mandate) has been difficult, as shown in figure 4. Initially, the\nunemployment rate (the solid black line) soared and inflation (the dashed red line) fell\nsharply. Moreover, after the recession officially ended in 2009, the subsequent recovery\nwas significantly slowed by a variety of persistent headwinds, including households with\nunderwater mortgages and high debt burdens, reduced access to credit for many potential\nborrowers, constrained spending by state and local governments, and weakened foreign\ngrowth prospects. In an effort to return employment and inflation to levels consistent\nwith the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate, the FOMC took a variety of unprecedented\nactions to help lower longer-term interest rates, including reducing the federal funds rate\n(the dotted black line) to near zero, communicating to the public that short-term interest\nrates would likely stay exceptionally low for some time, and buying large quantities of\nlonger-term Treasury debt and agency-issued mortgage-backed securities.15\nThese actions contributed to highly accommodative financial conditions, thereby\nhelping to bring about a considerable improvement in labor market conditions over time.\nThe unemployment rate, which peaked at 10 percent in 2009, is now 5.1 percent, slightly\nabove the median of FOMC participants’ current estimates of its longer-run normal level.\nAlthough other indicators suggest that the unemployment rate currently understates how\nmuch slack remains in the labor market, on balance the economy is no longer far away\ninflation in the vicinity of 4 percent or higher would stretch the meaning of “stable prices” in the Federal\nReserve Act.\n15 For a more complete listing of the Federal Reserve’s policy actions in recent years, see “The Federal\nReserve’s Response to the Financial Crisis and Action to Foster Maximum Employment and Price\nStability,” a webpage available on the Board’s website at\nwww.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_crisisresponse.htm.

In contrast, inflation has continued to run below the Committee’s\nobjective over the past several years, and over the past 12 months it has been essentially\nzero. Nevertheless, the Committee expects that inflation will gradually return to\n2 percent over the next two or three years. I will now turn to the determinants of inflation\nand the factors that underlie this expectation.\nInflation Dynamics\nModels used to describe and predict inflation commonly distinguish between\nchanges in food and energy prices--which enter into total inflation--and movements in the\nprices of other goods and services--that is, core inflation. This decomposition is useful\nbecause food and energy prices can be extremely volatile, with fluctuations that often\ndepend on factors that are beyond the influence of monetary policy, such as technological\nor political developments (in the case of energy prices) or weather or disease (in the case\nof food prices). As a result, core inflation usually provides a better indicator than total\ninflation of where total inflation is headed in the medium term.16 Of course, food and\nenergy account for a significant portion of household budgets, so the Federal Reserve’s\ninflation objective is defined in terms of the overall change in consumer prices.\nWhat, then, determines core inflation? Recalling figure 1, core inflation tends to\nfluctuate around a longer-term trend that now is essentially stable. Let me first focus on\nthese fluctuations before turning to the trend. Economic theory suggests, and empirical\nanalysis confirms, that such deviations of inflation from trend depend partly on the\n16 Several other approaches are commonly used to abstract from the short-term volatility of overall inflation\nand thereby better discern its medium-term direction. For example, one procedure removes the\ncomponents of the total PCE price index with the largest or smallest price changes before computing the\naverage price change, yielding the “trimmed mean” PCE index; another uses the median price change in a\ngiven period, rather than the mean change, to represent the overall inflation rate. In practice, simply using\ncore inflation does about as well in predicting overall inflation over the coming year and beyond as these\nalternative procedures (see Detmeister, 2011, 2012).\n\n- 11 -\nintensity of resource utilization in the economy--as approximated, for example, by the\ngap between the actual unemployment rate and its so-called natural rate, or by the\nshortfall of actual gross domestic product (GDP) from potential output. This\nrelationship--which likely reflects, among other things, a tendency for firms’ costs to rise\nas utilization rates increase--represents an important channel through which monetary\npolicy influences inflation over the medium term, although in practice the influence is\nmodest and gradual. Movements in certain types of input costs, particularly changes in\nthe price of imported goods, also can cause core inflation to deviate noticeably from its\ntrend, sometimes by a marked amount from year to year.17 Finally, a nontrivial fraction\nof the quarter-to-quarter, and even the year-to-year, variability of inflation is attributable\nto idiosyncratic and often unpredictable shocks.18\nWhat about the determinants of inflation’s longer-term trend? Here, it is\ninstructive to compare the purely statistical estimate of the trend rate of future inflation\nshown earlier in figure 1 with survey measures of people’s actual expectations of long-\nrun inflation, as is done in figure 5. Theory suggests that inflation expectations--which\npresumably are linked to the central bank’s inflation goal--should play an important role\nin actual price setting.19 Indeed, the contours of these series are strikingly similar, which\n17 Another input cost that can affect core inflation is the price of energy; in recent decades, however, the\npass-through of energy price changes to core inflation appears much smaller than in previous periods (see\nHooker, 2002; Clark and Terry, 2010).\n18 Some of these idiosyncratic shocks are related to identifiable factors, such as changes in Medicare\nreimbursement rates or movements in the (imputed) price of holding a checking account. (Both of these\nfactors are included in the services component of the PCE price index, but not the consumer price index\n(CPI).) However, not all idiosyncratic shocks can be reliably traced to specific factors, as a significant\nfraction represents unpredictable “noise.”\n19 Most theoretical versions of the Phillips curve suggest that inflation should depend on short-run inflation\nexpectations, but, as an empirical matter, measures of long-run expectations appear to explain the data\nbetter.\n\n- 12 -\nsuggests that the estimated trend in inflation is in fact related to households’ and firms’\nlong-run inflation expectations.20\nTo summarize, this analysis suggests that economic slack, changes in imported\ngoods prices, and idiosyncratic shocks all cause core inflation to deviate from a longer-\nterm trend that is ultimately determined by long-run inflation expectations. As some will\nrecognize, this model of core inflation is a variant of a theoretical model that is\ncommonly referred to as an expectations-augmented Phillips curve.21 Total inflation in\nturn reflects movements in core inflation, combined with changes in the prices of food\nand energy.\nAn important feature of this model of inflation dynamics is that the overall effect\nthat variations in resource utilization, import prices, and other factors will have on\ninflation depends crucially on whether these influences also affect long-run inflation\nexpectations. Figure 6 illustrates this point with a stylized example of the inflation\nconsequences of a gradual increase in the level of import prices--perhaps occurring in\nresponse to stronger real activity abroad or a fall in the exchange value of the dollar--that\ncauses the rate of change of import prices to be elevated for a time.22 First, consider the\n20 See Clark and Davig (2008); see also Faust and Wright (2013), who make a related point in the context\nof inflation forecasting. Note that the question about expected inflation in the University of Michigan\nSurveys of Consumers is not phrased in terms of a specific measure of prices, so its level--as opposed to its\ncontour--cannot be directly compared with a particular measure of inflation such as the change in the PCE\nprice index.\n21 See Tobin (1972) and Friedman (1968) for early discussions of the theory underpinning the expectations-\naugmented Phillips curve. Theoretical descriptions of the inflation process remain an active area of\nresearch in economics. In recent years, many economic theorists have used a so-called new-Keynesian\nframework--in which optimizing agents are assumed to face constraints on price or wage setting in the form\nof adjustment costs or explicit nominal contracts--to model inflation dynamics (see Woodford, 2003,\nchapter 3, for a textbook treatment). Although these new-Keynesian inflation models can differ\nimportantly in their specifics, they all tend to assign a central role to inflation expectations and resource\nutilization as drivers of inflation dynamics.\n22 In this exercise, we ignore any inflation effects that might arise because of shifts in resource utilization\ninduced by the change in import prices, which are expressed relative to core prices.\n\n- 13 -\nsituation shown in panel A, in which households’ and firms’ expectations of inflation are\nnot solidly anchored, but instead adjust in response to the rates of inflation that are\nactually observed.23 Such conditions--which arguably prevailed in the United States from\nthe 1970s to the mid-1990s--could plausibly arise if the central bank has, in the past,\nallowed significant and persistent movements in inflation to occur. In this case, the\ntemporary rise in the rate of change of import prices results in a permanent increase in\ninflation. This shift occurs because the initial increase in inflation generated by a period\nof rising import prices leads households and firms to revise up their expectations of future\ninflation. A permanent rise in inflation would also result from a sustained rise in the\nlevel of oil prices or a temporary increase in resource utilization.\nBy contrast, suppose that inflation expectations are instead well anchored, perhaps\nbecause the central bank has been successful over time in keeping inflation near some\nspecified target and has made it clear to the public that it intends to continue to do so.\nThen the response of inflation to a temporary increase in the rate of change of import\nprices or any other transitory shock will resemble the pattern shown in panel B. In this\ncase, inflation will deviate from its longer-term level only as long as import prices are\nrising. But once they level out, inflation will fall back to its previous trend in the absence\nof other disturbances.24\nA key implication of these two examples is that the presence of well-anchored\ninflation expectations greatly enhances a central bank’s ability to pursue both of its\n23 An expectations-augmented Phillips curve in which expectations of inflation are assumed to eventually\nrespond one-for-one to actual past inflation is typically referred to as an accelerationist Phillips curve.\n24 Qualitatively similar results obtain in fully specified structural models with rational expectations--\nincluding the FRB/US, EDO, and SIGMA models maintained at the Federal Reserve Board--in which the\nlong-term behavior of inflation and inflation expectations is governed by the central bank’s (fixed) inflation\nobjective.\n\n- 14 -\nobjectives--namely, price stability and full employment. Because temporary shifts in the\nrate of change of import prices or other transitory shocks have no permanent influence on\nexpectations, they have only a transitory effect on inflation. As a result, the central bank\ncan “look through” such short-run inflationary disturbances in setting monetary policy,\nallowing it to focus on returning the economy to full employment without placing price\nstability at risk. Indeed, the Federal Reserve has done just that in setting monetary policy\nover the past decade or more. Moreover, as I will discuss shortly, these inflation\ndynamics are a key reason why the FOMC expects inflation to return to 2 percent over\nthe next few years.\nOn balance, the evidence suggests that inflation expectations are in fact well\nanchored at present. Figure 7 plots the two survey measures of longer-term expected\ninflation I presented earlier, along with a measure of longer-term inflation compensation\nderived as the difference between yields on nominal Treasury securities and inflation-\nindexed ones, called TIPS. Since the late 1990s, survey measures of longer-term\ninflation expectations have been quite stable; this stability has persisted in recent years\ndespite a deep recession and concerns expressed by some observers regarding the\npotential inflationary effects of unconventional monetary policy. The fact that these\nsurvey measures appear to have remained anchored at about the same levels that\nprevailed prior to the recession suggests that, once the economy has returned to full\nemployment (and absent any other shocks), core inflation should return to its\npre-recession average level of about 2 percent.\nThis conclusion is tempered somewhat by recent movements in longer-run\ninflation compensation, which in principle could reflect changes in investors’\n\n- 15 -\nexpectations for long-run inflation. This measure is now noticeably lower than in the\nyears just prior to the financial crisis.25 However, movements in inflation compensation\nare difficult to interpret because they can be driven by factors that are unique to financial\nmarkets--such as movements in liquidity or risk premiums--as well as by changes in\nexpected inflation.26 Indeed, empirical work that attempts to control for these factors\nsuggests that the long-run inflation expectations embedded in asset prices have in fact\nmoved down relatively little over the past decade.27 Nevertheless, the decline in inflation\ncompensation over the past year may indicate that financial market participants now see\nan increased risk of very low inflation persisting.\nAlthough the evidence, on balance, suggests that inflation expectations are well\nanchored at present, policymakers would be unwise to take this situation for granted.\nAnchored inflation expectations were not won easily or quickly: Experience suggests\nthat it takes many years of carefully conducted monetary policy to alter what households\nand firms perceive to be inflation’s “normal” behavior, and, furthermore, that a persistent\nfailure to keep inflation under control--by letting it drift either too high or too low for too\n25 In evaluating the potential implications of this decline for expected PCE inflation, one also needs to keep\nin mind that TIPS are indexed to the CPI. CPI inflation generally runs a few tenths of a percentage point\nhigher than PCE inflation, though that differential can vary materially over time.\n26 Another complication is that we do not know whose expectations “matter” for determining inflation.\nInflation expectations of professional forecasters (such as those collected in the Blue Chip Economic\nIndicators, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, or the Survey of Primary Dealers) or inflation\nexpectations derived from asset prices probably capture the views of participants in financial markets but\nneed not reflect the views of households and firms more broadly. As an empirical matter, the little\ninformation available on the longer-term inflation expectations of firms from the Atlanta Federal Reserve\nBusiness Inflation Expectations survey suggests that firms’ expectations more closely resemble\nexpectations from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers than the expectations of professional\nforecasters. Similarly, preliminary data from a New Zealand study suggests that inflation forecasts of firms\nare much more similar to those of households than those of professional forecasters (see Coibion and\nGorodnichenko, 2015).\n27 D’Amico, Kim, and Wei (2014) examine a number of models that use TIPS yields to back out expected\ninflation estimates. The best-fitting models show only a small decline in longer-term inflation expectations\nsince 2005.\n\n- 16 -\nlong--could cause expectations to once again become unmoored.28 Given that inflation\nhas been running below the FOMC’s objective for several years now, such concerns\nreinforce the appropriateness of the Federal Reserve’s current monetary policy, which\nremains highly accommodative by historical standards and is directed toward helping\nreturn inflation to 2 percent over the medium term.29\nBefore turning to the implications of this inflation model for the current outlook\nand monetary policy, a cautionary note is in order. The Phillips-curve approach to\nforecasting inflation has a long history in economics, and it has usefully informed\nmonetary policy decisionmaking around the globe. But the theoretical underpinnings of\nthe model are still a subject of controversy among economists. Moreover, inflation\nsometimes moves in ways that empirical versions of the model, which necessarily are a\n28 My interpretation of the historical evidence is that long-run inflation expectations become anchored at a\nparticular level only after a central bank succeeds in keeping actual inflation near some target level for\nmany years. For that reason, I am somewhat skeptical about the actual effectiveness of any monetary\npolicy that relies primarily on the central bank’s theoretical ability to influence the public’s inflation\nexpectations directly by simply announcing that it will pursue a different inflation goal in the future.\nAlthough such announcements might potentially persuade some financial market participants and\nprofessional forecasters to shift their expectations, other members of the public are probably much less\nlikely to do so. Hence, actual inflation would probably be affected only after the central bank has had\nsufficient time to concretely demonstrate its sustained commitment and ability to generate a new norm for\nthe average level of inflation and the behavior of monetary policy--a process that might take years, based\non U.S. experience. Consistent with my assessment that announcements alone are not enough, Bernanke\nand others (1999) found no evidence across a number of countries that the initial disinflation which follows\nthe adoption of inflation targeting is any less costly than disinflations carried out under alternative\nmonetary regimes.\n29 Some might be surprised that the preceding discussion of inflation determinants makes no mention of\nlabor costs. In the past, wages provided a good empirical indicator of the future direction of price inflation;\nindeed, the presence of a so-called wage-price spiral--in which higher price inflation led workers to push\nfor higher wage growth, thereby in turn leading to even faster price increases as firms’ labor costs\naccelerated--was often invoked to explain the inflationary dynamics of the 1970s. The wage-price spiral no\nlonger seems to provide a useful description of the U.S. inflation process. In fact, some evidence suggests\nthat, like inflation, the rate of growth of labor costs is now characterized by a stable long-run trend; again, a\nlikely explanation for this empirical finding is the improved anchoring of long-term inflation expectations.\n(See Peneva and Rudd, 2015, for some suggestive evidence along these lines.) More generally, movements\nin labor costs no longer appear to be an especially good guide to future price movements. (This\ndevelopment does not imply that wage developments carry no useful information: Because wage growth is\ninfluenced by labor market slack, observed movements in compensation gains can provide an indication of\nhow close the economy is to full employment.)\n\n- 17 -\nsimplified version of a complicated reality, cannot adequately explain. For this reason,\nsignificant uncertainty attaches to Phillips curve predictions, and the validity of forecasts\nfrom this model must be continuously evaluated in response to incoming data.\nPolicy Implications\nAssuming that my reading of the data is correct and long-run inflation\nexpectations are in fact anchored near their pre-recession levels, what implications does\nthe preceding description of inflation dynamics have for the inflation outlook and for\nmonetary policy?\nThis framework suggests, first, that much of the recent shortfall of inflation from\nour 2 percent objective is attributable to special factors whose effects are likely to prove\ntransitory. As the solid black line in figure 8 indicates, PCE inflation has run noticeably\nbelow our 2 percent objective on average since 2008, with the shortfall approaching\nabout 1 percentage point in both 2013 and 2014 and more than 1-1/2 percentage points\nthis year. The stacked bars in the figure give the contributions of various factors to these\ndeviations from 2 percent, computed using an estimated version of the simple inflation\nmodel I just discussed.30 As the solid blue portion of the bars shows, falling consumer\nenergy prices explain about half of this year’s shortfall and a sizable portion of the 2013\nand 2014 shortfalls as well. Another important source of downward pressure this year\nhas been a decline in import prices, the portion with orange checkerboard pattern, which\n30 For a technical explanation of the procedure used to produce this decomposition, see the appendix. In the\ndecomposition procedure, movements in core inflation affect headline inflation one-for-one; as a result, the\ncontributions of food and energy price inflation are defined as each component’s price change relative to\nthe core, weighted by its share in total nominal consumer spending. (Note that the “other” category\nincludes the effects of changes in food prices.) The estimated contribution of movements in import prices\nis also computed relative to core inflation; thus, if import prices are rising at the same rate as core inflation,\nthey have no estimated effect on the shortfall of overall inflation from 2 percent. In addition, the\ndecomposition takes account of lags in the adjustment of core inflation to movements in resource utilization\nand other factors.\n\n- 18 -\nis largely attributable to the 15 percent appreciation in the dollar’s exchange value over\nthe past year. In contrast, the restraint imposed by economic slack, the green dotted\nportion, has diminished steadily over time as the economy has recovered and is now\nestimated to be relatively modest.31 Finally, a similarly small portion of the current\nshortfall of inflation from 2 percent is explained by other factors (which include changes\nin food prices); importantly, the effects of these other factors are transitory and often\nswitch sign from year to year.\nAlthough an accounting exercise like this one is always imprecise and will depend\non the specific model that is used, I think its basic message--that the current near-zero\nrate of inflation can mostly be attributed to the temporary effects of falling prices for\nenergy and non-energy imports--is quite plausible. If so, the 12-month change in total\nPCE prices is likely to rebound to 1-1/2 percent or higher in 2016, barring a further\nsubstantial drop in crude oil prices and provided that the dollar does not appreciate\nnoticeably further.\nTo be reasonably confident that inflation will return to 2 percent over the next few\nyears, we need, in turn, to be reasonably confident that we will see continued solid\neconomic growth and further gains in resource utilization, with longer-term inflation\nexpectations remaining near their pre-recession level. Fortunately, prospects for the U.S.\neconomy generally appear solid. Monthly payroll gains have averaged close to 210,000\nsince the start of the year and the overall economy has been expanding modestly faster\n31 As discussed later, the current difference between the unemployment rate and its normal longer-run level\nlikely understates the actual amount of slack that remains in the labor market. If so, the estimates reported\nin figure 8 somewhat understate the contribution of slack to the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent\nand, correspondingly, overstate the contribution from other factors. For example, if the standard\nunemployment gap currently understates the true level of slack by 1/2 percentage point, then the\ncontribution of slack to this year’s inflation shortfall is roughly 0.1 percentage point larger than the estimate\nreported in figure 8.\n\n- 19 -\nthan its productive potential. My colleagues and I, based on our most recent forecasts,\nanticipate that this pattern will continue and that labor market conditions will improve\nfurther as we head into 2016.\nThe labor market has achieved considerable progress over the past several years.\nEven so, further improvement in labor market conditions would be welcome because we\nare probably not yet all the way back to full employment. Although the unemployment\nrate may now be close to its longer-run normal level--which most FOMC participants\nnow estimate is around 4.9 percent--this traditional metric of resource utilization almost\ncertainly understates the actual amount of slack that currently exists: On a cyclically\nadjusted basis, the labor force participation rate remains low relative to its underlying\ntrend, and an unusually large number of people are working part time but would prefer\nfull-time employment.32 Consistent with this assessment is the slow pace at which hourly\nwages and compensation have been rising, which suggests that most firms still find it\nrelatively easy to hire and retain employees.\nReducing slack along these other dimensions may involve a temporary decline in\nthe unemployment rate somewhat below the level that is estimated to be consistent, in the\nlonger run, with inflation stabilizing at 2 percent. For example, attracting discouraged\nworkers back into the labor force may require a period of especially plentiful\nemployment opportunities and strong hiring. Similarly, firms may be unwilling to\nrestructure their operations to use more full-time workers until they encounter greater\ndifficulty filling part-time positions. Beyond these considerations, a modest decline in\n32 For a further discussion of the current level of resource utilization, see the Federal Reserve Board’s most\nrecent Monetary Policy Report, dated July 15, 2015, available on the Board’s website at\nwww.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/mpr_default.htm.\n\n- 20 -\nthe unemployment rate below its long-run level for a time would, by increasing resource\nutilization, also have the benefit of speeding the return to 2 percent inflation. Finally,\nalbeit more speculatively, such an environment might help reverse some of the significant\nsupply-side damage that appears to have occurred in recent years, thereby improving\nAmericans’ standard of living. 33\nConsistent with the inflation framework I have outlined, the medians of the\nprojections provided by FOMC participants at our recent meeting show inflation\ngradually moving back to 2 percent, accompanied by a temporary decline in\nunemployment slightly below the median estimate of the rate expected to prevail in the\nlonger run. These projections embody two key judgments regarding the projected\nrelationship between real activity and interest rates. First, the real federal funds rate is\ncurrently somewhat below the level that would be consistent with real GDP expanding in\nline with potential, which implies that the unemployment rate is likely to continue to fall\nin the absence of some tightening. Second, participants implicitly expect that the various\nheadwinds to economic growth that I mentioned earlier will continue to fade, thereby\nboosting the economy’s underlying strength. Combined, these two judgments imply that\nthe real interest rate consistent with achieving and then maintaining full employment in\nthe medium run should rise gradually over time. This expectation, coupled with inherent\nlags in the response of real activity and inflation to changes in monetary policy, are the\nkey reasons that most of my colleagues and I anticipate that it will likely be appropriate\nto raise the target range for the federal funds rate sometime later this year and to continue\n33 For a discussion of the supply-side damage that has occurred since 2007 and the potential benefits of\npartially reversing it through more accommodative monetary policy, see Reifschneider, Wascher, and\nWilcox (2015) and Van Zandweghe (forthcoming).\n\n- 21 -\nboosting short-term rates at a gradual pace thereafter as the labor market improves further\nand inflation moves back to our 2 percent objective.\nBy itself, the precise timing of the first increase in our target for the federal funds\nrate should have only minor implications for financial conditions and the general\neconomy. What matters for overall financial conditions is the entire trajectory of short-\nterm interest rates that is anticipated by markets and the public. As I noted, most of my\ncolleagues and I anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant raising short-\nterm interest rates at a quite gradual pace over the next few years. It’s important to\nemphasize, however, that both the timing of the first rate increase and any subsequent\nadjustments to our federal funds rate target will depend on how developments in the\neconomy influence the Committee’s outlook for progress toward maximum employment\nand 2 percent inflation.\nThe economic outlook, of course, is highly uncertain and it is conceivable, for\nexample, that inflation could remain appreciably below our 2 percent target despite the\napparent anchoring of inflation expectations. Here, Japan’s recent history may be\ninstructive: As shown in figure 9, survey measures of longer-term expected inflation in\nthat country remained positive and stable even as that country experienced many years of\npersistent, mild deflation.34 The explanation for the persistent divergence between actual\nand expected inflation in Japan is not clear, but I believe that it illustrates a problem faced\nby all central banks: Economists’ understanding of the dynamics of inflation is far from\nperfect. Reflecting that limited understanding, the predictions of our models often err,\n34 In addition, we cannot count on expectations remaining anchored if the Federal Reserve were to permit\nactual inflation to continue to run noticeably below its announced objective after the real economy has\nsubstantially recovered.\n\n- 22 -\nsometimes significantly so. Accordingly, inflation may rise more slowly or rapidly than\nthe Committee currently anticipates; should such a development occur, we would need to\nadjust the stance of policy in response.\nConsiderable uncertainties also surround the outlook for economic activity. For\nexample, we cannot be certain about the pace at which the headwinds still restraining the\ndomestic economy will continue to fade. Moreover, net exports have served as a\nsignificant drag on growth over the past year and recent global economic and financial\ndevelopments highlight the risk that a slowdown in foreign growth might restrain U.S.\neconomic activity somewhat further. The Committee is monitoring developments\nabroad, but we do not currently anticipate that the effects of these recent developments on\nthe U.S. economy will prove to be large enough to have a significant effect on the path\nfor policy. That said, in response to surprises affecting the outlook for economic activity,\nas with those affecting inflation, the FOMC would need to adjust the stance of policy so\nthat our actions remain consistent with inflation returning to our 2 percent objective over\nthe medium term in the context of maximum employment.\nGiven the highly uncertain nature of the outlook, one might ask: Why not hold\noff raising the federal funds rate until the economy has reached full employment and\ninflation is actually back at 2 percent? The difficulty with this strategy is that monetary\npolicy affects real activity and inflation with a substantial lag. If the FOMC were to\ndelay the start of the policy normalization process for too long, we would likely end up\nhaving to tighten policy relatively abruptly to keep the economy from significantly\novershooting both of our goals. Such an abrupt tightening would risk disrupting financial\nmarkets and perhaps even inadvertently push the economy into recession. In addition,\n\n- 23 -\ncontinuing to hold short-term interest rates near zero well after real activity has returned\nto normal and headwinds have faded could encourage excessive leverage and other forms\nof inappropriate risk-taking that might undermine financial stability. For these reasons,\nthe more prudent strategy is to begin tightening in a timely fashion and at a gradual pace,\nadjusting policy as needed in light of incoming data.\nConclusion\nTo conclude, let me emphasize that, following the dual mandate established by\nthe Congress, the Federal Reserve is committed to the achievement of maximum\nemployment and price stability. To this end, we have maintained a highly\naccommodative monetary policy since the financial crisis; that policy has fostered a\nmarked improvement in labor market conditions and helped check undesirable\ndisinflationary pressures. However, we have not yet fully attained our objectives under\nthe dual mandate: Some slack remains in labor markets, and the effects of this slack and\nthe influence of lower energy prices and past dollar appreciation have been significant\nfactors keeping inflation below our goal. But I expect that inflation will return to\n2 percent over the next few years as the temporary factors that are currently weighing on\ninflation wane, provided that economic growth continues to be strong enough to complete\nthe return to maximum employment and long-run inflation expectations remain well\nanchored. Most FOMC participants, including myself, currently anticipate that achieving\nthese conditions will likely entail an initial increase in the federal funds rate later this\nyear, followed by a gradual pace of tightening thereafter. But if the economy surprises\nus, our judgments about appropriate monetary policy will change.\n\n- 24 -\nReferences\nAscari, Guido, and Argia M.

The core inflation forecasting equation is\n𝜋𝑐 = .41𝜋𝑒 +.36𝜋𝑐 +.23𝜋𝑐 −.08𝑆𝐿𝐴𝐶𝐾 +.57𝑅𝑃𝐼𝑀 +𝜖 ,\n𝑡 𝑡 𝑡−1 𝑡−2 𝑡 𝑡 𝑡\nwhere 𝜋𝑒 is expected long-run inflation; 𝑆𝐿𝐴𝐶𝐾 denotes the level of resource utilization;\n𝑡 𝑡\n𝑅𝑃𝐼𝑀 controls for the effect of changes in the relative price of core imported goods; 𝜖\n𝑡 𝑡\nis a white-noise error term; and the coefficients are ordinary least squares estimates\nobtained using data from 1990:Q1 to 2014:Q4.\nFor estimation purposes, 𝑆𝐿𝐴𝐶𝐾 is approximated using the unemployment rate\n𝑡\nless the Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO) historical series for the long-run natural\nrate, while 𝜋𝑒 is proxied using the median forecasts of long-run PCE or CPI inflation\n𝑡\nreported in the Survey of Professional Forecasters, with a constant adjustment of 40 basis\n35 This appendix was revised on December 17, 2015, to provide additional information on the definition of\ncore import inflation and its implications for the longer-run rate of unemployment consistent with stable\ninflation. In addition, the original version of the appendix incorrectly reported that the adjustment factor\nused to convert historical readings on expected long-run inflation from a CPI basis to a PCE basis was\n50 basis points.\n\n- 29 -\npoints prior to 2007 to put the CPI forecasts on a PCE basis. (Prior to 1991:Q4, this\nseries is based on the long-run inflation expectations reported in the Hoey survey.) The\nrelative import price term, 𝑅𝑃𝐼𝑀 , is defined as the annualized growth rate of the price\n𝑡\nindex for core imported goods (defined to exclude petroleum, natural gas, computers, and\nsemiconductors), less the lagged four-quarter change in core PCE inflation, all multiplied\nby the share of nominal core imported goods in nominal GDP.36\nTo decompose recent movements in inflation into its various components, the\nseries used in the inflation model--for which data are available only through 2015:Q2 in\nmost cases--are first extended through the end of 2015. In the case of inflation, the\nextensions are consistent with the medians of FOMC participants’ projections for total\nand core PCE inflation in 2015 that were reported at the press conference following the\nSeptember FOMC meeting.37 Similarly, 𝑆𝐿𝐴𝐶𝐾 over the second half of 2015 is defined\n𝑡\nto be consistent with the median of FOMC projections for the 2015:Q4 unemployment\nrate, less the CBO’s estimates of the historical path of the long-run natural rate; the\nCBO’s 2015 estimate is almost identical to the median of FOMC participants’ most\nrecent projections of the normal longer-run level of the unemployment rate. For changes\nin the prices of consumer energy and core imports, the 2015:H2 extrapolations are based\non regressions of these two series on current and lagged changes in, respectively, crude\noil prices and exchange rates. This approach predicts that energy prices should decline at\nannual rates of about 6 percent in 2015:Q3 and 18 percent in 2015:Q4, while core import\n36 This measure of core import prices is constructed by Board staff using published and unpublished data\nprovided by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n37 The information on participants’ forecasts provided at the September 17, 2015, press conference is\navailable on the Board’s website at\nwww.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20150917.pdf.\n\n- 30 -\nprices should fall about 2-1/2 percent at an annual rate in both quarters.38 Food prices are\nassumed to remain flat at their 2015:Q2 level; this assumption ensures that the combined\ncontribution of food and energy prices to inflation in 2015 is consistent with the median\ndifference between FOMC participants’ projections for total and core inflation. Finally,\nnominal spending shares for food, energy, and core imports are assumed to remain\nunchanged at their 2015:Q2 levels, and long-run inflation expectations are assumed to\nremain constant at 2 percent.\nAfter computing historical 𝜖 tracking errors for the two equations of the model,\n𝑡\nthe final step in the decomposition procedure is to run a sequence of counter-factual\nsimulations of the model from 1990:Q1 through 2015:Q4. One by one, each explanatory\nvariable of the model is set to zero and the model is simulated; the resulting difference\nbetween actual inflation and its simulated value equals the historical contribution of that\nparticular factor. Importantly, the simulations are all dynamic in that the lagged inflation\nterm in the core inflation equation is set equal to its simulated value in the preceding\nperiod, rather than its actual value. As a result, the decompositions incorporate the\neffects of changes in lagged inflation that are attributable to previous movements in the\nexplanatory variables.\n38 The level of core import prices, expressed relative to core consumer prices, displayed a modest\ndownward trend from 1990 through 2001 but since then has displayed little persistent trend, particularly if\none controls for shifts related to recent changes in the real exchange rate. If the post-2001 pattern persists\nin coming years, then 𝑅𝑃𝐼𝑀 would be expected to converge to zero within a few quarters and core PCE\n𝑡\ninflation to converge to 2 percent within two or three years, assuming that the unemployment rate remains\nclose to 5 percent (the CBO estimate of the natural rate) and there are no further shocks to the exchange\nrate and other factors. If, however, core import prices were expected to resume trending down relative to\nconsumer prices, then the model as specified would imply that the unemployment rate consistent with\ninflation stabilizing at 2 percent in the longer run would be somewhat lower than 5 percent.\n\nFigure 1\nU.S. Inflation since the 1960s\n4-quarter percent change\n14 14\nTotal PCE price index\n12 12\n10 10\n8 8\nCore PCE price index\n6 6\n4 4\n2 Long-term trend 2\nQ2\n0 0\n-2 -2\n1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015\n2\nNote: The data are quarterly.

    "text": "Speech to Community Leaders Luncheon\nSalt Lake City, Utah\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery Thursday September 4, 2008, 11:30 AM Pacific, 12:30 PM Mountain\nThe U.S. Economic Situation and the Challenges for Monetary Policy1\nGood afternoon, everyone, and thank you for coming. It is always a pleasure to\nvisit Salt Lake City. Our branch office was established here in 1918, and the Fed’s ties to\nthis community are long and deep. This morning, the directors of our Salt Lake City Board\nmet with their counterparts from Seattle and Portland to discuss economic trends and to\nshare insights on factors affecting the outlook for both our region and the nation as a\nwhole. The Fed’s Twelfth District comprises nine western states, 20 percent of the\nAmerican population and economy, and one-third of the country’s landmass. We are by far\nthe largest and most diverse Reserve District in the nation, so we rely extensively on our\ndirectors—those of our four branches and of our head-office Board in San Francisco—and\nmembers of the larger business communities we serve to help us identify emerging\neconomic trends. The main focus of my remarks today will be on conditions in the U.S.\neconomy as a whole and their implications for monetary policy. But I will touch on some\nof the unique factors that are affecting the Utah economy as well.\nRegrettably, the nation’s economy has been in rough waters for over a year now.\nLast summer, a precipitous slide in house prices triggered a crisis in financial markets and a\ncredit crunch that is making it hard for consumers and some firms to borrow. These\ndevelopments are ongoing and perhaps deepening, as banks and other financial\n1 I would like to thank the Economic Research staff for support in preparing these remarks and, in\nparticular, John Judd, Reuven Glick, Rob Valletta, and Judith Goff.\n1\n\nintermediaries are continuing to delever by scaling back their balance sheets and shrinking\ntheir lending activity. Indeed, some sources of funding have completely dried up. In the\nface of these developments, firms and consumers have also been pulling back, causing\nunemployment to rise. As if this cycle of events feeding back on each other weren’t bad\nenough, oil and other commodity prices have surged in recent years, generating worrisome\nnumbers for headline consumer inflation. So, the problems facing the Fed have been\nmyriad, complex, and difficult. We have had to balance concerns about economic\nweakness with equally compelling, but conflicting, concerns about inflation.\nQuite recently, there has been a bit of a shift in the inflation picture, however.\nCommodity prices—most notably oil prices—have fallen well below their earlier peaks. I\nwill argue that this development probably largely reflects a weakening in economic\nconditions in many industrialized countries, including European nations and Japan. By\nreducing the worldwide demand for commodities, weaker global growth should relieve\nupward pressure on U.S. inflation. Lower commodity prices should also be good for U.S.\neconomic growth, although this benefit is likely to be counterbalanced to some degree by\nthe detrimental effects of slower foreign economic growth on our exports, which have been\nsurging. If commodity prices keep falling—or even if they remain at current levels—the\nFed’s objective of promoting both price stability and full employment will become more\nreadily achievable.\nBefore I turn to a brief review of where the U.S. economy stands now, I want to\nremind you that my remarks represent my own views and not necessarily those of my\ncolleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n2\n\nHousing\nBecause the “boom and bust” cycle in the housing market was the trigger for many\nof the developments I’ll be discussing, I would like to start there. Since the end of 2005,\noutlays for residential construction have been falling at double-digit rates, in inflation-\nadjusted terms, and house prices have fallen by 15 to 20 percent, depending on the measure\nyou use. In what may be a ray of hope for the future, sales of new homes show tentative\nsigns of stabilizing—albeit at a level that is a mere 40 percent of their 2005 peak—and the\npace of price declines has slowed in the past several months, although these prices are still\ndown substantially from year-ago levels.\nBehind these national figures, of course, lies considerable geographic diversity.\nSalt Lake City and Utah have fortunately done much better than the national average in\nterms of prices; house prices continued to rise at a healthy pace in 2007, and show only\nmodest declines thus far in 2008. Nonetheless, the state is not immune from the housing\nslump. The pace of home sales in Utah is down substantially since peaking in 2006, and\nnew home construction plummeted at the start of this year.\nThe effect of the collapse in the national housing market on our economy has been\nprofound. First, the decline in the pace of housing construction directly subtracted a full\npercentage point from overall real GDP growth in 2006, 2007, and the first half of this\nyear, and slower economic growth has pushed up the national unemployment rate to 5.7\npercent—almost a full percentage point above the level that, in my view, is consistent with\n“full employment.” Going forward, it seems unlikely that construction activity will pick up\nany time soon—inventories of unsold homes remain at elevated levels, and although home\n3\n\nsales have shown signs of leveling off recently, the volume of sales, as I noted, remains\nquite weak.\nSecond, the drop in house prices has weakened the financial condition of many\nconsumers because the value of their homes is an important part of their wealth and equity\nin those homes serves as collateral for home equity loans and other types of borrowing.\nThe result is that consumers are likely to spend less, reducing the pace of economic\nactivity. Declining house prices also appear to be the single biggest factor behind the\nrecent rise in mortgage delinquencies and home foreclosures. When families face financial\ndifficulties due to illness, job loss, or divorce, an equity cushion often allows them to get\nthrough the hard times by borrowing needed funds or even selling the house. But when\nhome price declines have wiped out home equity or driven it into negative territory, people\noften end up in delinquency or foreclosure. Indeed, the vitality of the subprime mortgage\nmarket appeared to depend on continued home price appreciation, and, of course, it is now\nin shambles. After posting delinquency rates in the single digits in 2005, around 20 percent\nof subprime mortgages are currently delinquent or in foreclosure nationwide. Delinquency\nrates on prime mortgages, which are far lower, are nonetheless also on the rise.\nUtah has been fortunate that mortgage delinquencies barely budged during 2007\nand early 2008, remaining at historically low levels while they were rising precipitously in\nother parts of the nation. Home foreclosures in the state have risen over the past few\nquarters, though, and further increases are likely before the slowdown ends.\nFinancial Markets\n4\n\nThe third profound effect of the national housing market collapse, of course, has\nbeen felt in the financial markets since last August. Unfortunately, the turmoil is still alive\nand well, and conditions remain very fragile. For example, spreads between the rates that\nmust be paid by risky borrowers over those on Treasury securities remain very high. The\ndebt ratings for several important bond insurers have been cut, and stock prices for\nfinancial institutions have plummeted. We’ve begun to see a growing number of failures\nof depository institutions—notably IndyMac, which represented the largest failure in\ndecades.\nIn addition, many financial markets are still not operating efficiently or effectively.\nIn particular, the market for so-called private-label securitized mortgages of even the\nhighest quality remains moribund. These complex instruments were the primary source of\nfinancing for nonconforming residential mortgages, including subprime loans.\nOutside of expanded lending by the FHA, there is now little or no lending to\nhigher-risk residential mortgage borrowers. Jumbo mortgages for prime borrowers are\navailable, but at historically high spreads over rates on conventional mortgages, as banks\nhave been reluctant to make these loans. Beyond higher rates, many depositories are\ntightening the terms of their lending, capping or terminating some home equity loans, and\nin general trying to reduce their exposure to credit losses by reducing the scale of their\nlending. Importantly, the government-sponsored agencies—Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,\nthe largest of all mortgage lenders—have suffered credit losses and are having to pare back\ntheir crucial roles in the mortgage market. The result of all of this is a severe economy-\nwide credit crunch, comparable to the one that hit the economy in the recession of the early\n1990s.\n5\n\nThe story of how falling house prices, and, in particular, their effects on the\nsubprime mortgage market, triggered the problems in financial markets is well-known. At\nthe most basic level, financial market participants suddenly realized that house price\ndeclines could result in substantial losses on subprime mortgages through delinquencies\nand foreclosures, that the extent of those losses was highly uncertain, and that the\ncomplexity of mortgage-backed securities and the collateralized debt obligations\nincorporating them made it difficult to know which participants would suffer the losses.\nThe story of how these problems will ultimately be resolved is far less clear.\nObviously, it would help a lot if house prices stopped falling. But even though the rate of\ndecline of house prices has shown signs of moderating, it still appears that these prices will\nkeep heading down for some time. The ratio of house prices to rents—a kind of price-\ndividend ratio for housing—still remains high by historical standards, despite having fallen\nsubstantially from its historical peak in early 2006, suggesting that further price declines\nare needed to bring housing markets into long-run balance. Moreover, large inventories of\nunsold homes can be expected to continue to put downward pressure on housing prices. In\nview of these factors, it’s not surprising that the futures market for house prices predicts\nfurther declines this year.\nGoing forward, the ability and willingness of commercial banks and other\nintermediaries to extend credit depends in part on their capital levels, which have been\nharmed by large losses, and their capacity to expand equity capital. It is encouraging that\nfinancial institutions have raised a considerable amount of new capital over the past year.\nEven so, balance sheet pressures and broader financial market dislocations may well be\nwith us for some time. My guess is that market functioning will improve in 2009, but\n6\n\nthings could get worse before they get better. One major concern is that home prices could\nfall more than markets now expect, leading to larger losses for financial institutions, which\nwould further impair their ability to make new loans. The deepening of the credit crunch\ncould then lead to further declines in house prices, intensifying the adverse feedback loop\nthat seems to be operating in our economy.\nCommodities\nBeyond the many repercussions of falling house prices, another factor putting a\ndamper on economic activity has been surging prices for commodities, including energy,\nfood and metals. There’s plenty of debate about where this surge in commodity prices\ncame from. Indeed, some have argued that speculative trading in commodity markets is the\nmain cause. Personally, I’m not yet persuaded by that explanation. For example, if\nspeculators were important in driving prices up, then inventories would have risen as these\nspeculators sought to profit from future sales at higher prices. However, inventories have\ninstead been declining in most commodity markets, apparently reflecting high fundamental\ndemand from buyers who actually use the commodities in the production of other products.\nIn fact, in general, I’m more persuaded by arguments based on the fundamentals of\ndemand and supply—and I think they explain not only much of the run-up in commodity\nprices, but also the recent declines. In the run-up, demand was boosted by rapid worldwide\neconomic growth, with China and other developing countries accounting for a good deal of\nthe increase. At the same time, new supplies of oil have been harder to come by. As for\nfood prices, supply has been constrained by a number of factors, including drought\nconditions that hampered wheat production in Australia, and demand for biofuels that has\ndiverted crops away from food usage.\n7\n\nThe fundamental forces of supply and demand can also explain the drop in energy\nand some other commodity prices since June. Most important is that the demand for\ncommodities has most likely fallen in response to a weakening of economic growth in\nmany industrialized countries. Economic growth of industrialized countries slowed\nmarkedly in the second quarter. In fact, growth was only barely positive in the OECD bloc\nas a whole. The OECD is a Paris-based organization comprising 30 developed nations.\nJapan, France, Germany and Italy all experienced outright contractions. Moreover,\nprospects for growth do not appear to be that good for the second half of this year; for\nexample, the OECD Economic Outlook projects growth of only 1¼ percent for Japan, the\neuro area, and the total of 30 OECD countries in this period.\nSeveral factors are behind the worsening outlook abroad. First, as in the U.S.,\nhigher oil and food prices have cut into consumer spending. Second, although most of\nEurope had little subprime lending of its own, deteriorating U.S. financial market\nconditions have affected banks and markets abroad that invested in structured products\noriginated in the U.S.; this is particularly true for banks in the United Kingdom,\nSwitzerland, Germany, and France. As in the U.S., this exposure has led to higher funding\ncosts, tighter bank lending standards, and wider spreads for riskier borrowers. Third,\nseveral countries, including Spain, Ireland, and the U.K., have experienced their own\nhousing booms and downturns, creating further stress on their banking sectors. Fourth,\nslower growth in the U.S. and the appreciation of their currencies against the dollar will\ntend to dampen European and Japanese exports.\nFinally, monetary policy in Europe has been less accommodative during this period\nthan in the U.S. For example, while the Fed cut its target interest rate substantially to 2\n8\n\npercent during the course of the credit crisis that began last summer, the European Central\nBank kept its policy interest rate steady throughout, and then tightened by 25 basis points\nto 4¼ percent in July. Part of the reason for the difference is that the European Central\nBank’s mandate requires it to focus on controlling headline inflation, which reached 4\npercent for the twelve months ending in July—a rate well above its official objective of\nbelow, but close to 2 percent. In addition, even though much of the recent increase in\ninflation is attributable to commodity prices, and therefore likely to be a temporary\nphenomenon, the central bank has been worried about second-round effects on inflation\nexpectations, wages, and other costs, and justifiably so. The euro zone has a greater degree\nof wage indexation and collective bargaining than the U.S.2 So it is more likely that higher\nheadline inflation will fairly quickly get built into wages there, setting off a wage-price\nspiral that could be persistent and difficult to stop.\nNow that growth appears to be weakening outside the United States, and prospects\nfor inflation have improved with recent declines in commodity prices, financial markets\nhave revised down expected future levels of interest rates in the euro zone and elsewhere.\nAs a result, in recent months the course of the dollar has changed from the steady decline\nover the prior six years to an appreciation. A stronger dollar will tend to weaken demand\nfor our exports, reinforcing the effects of weaker growth abroad.\n2 According to the ECB, wage indexation exists for roughly 13 percent of workers in France, 2/3 in Spain\nand Cyprus, and 100 percent in Belgium and Luxembourg (“Wage growth dispersion across the euro area\ncountries,” ECB Occasional Paper No. 90, July 2008). In other cases, wages are indirectly linked to\ninflation through collective bargaining agreements. For example, the IG Metal trade union negotiated a 5.2\npercent wage increase in the German steel industry. Other sectors, such as the automotive industry or the\ncivil service, also won wage increases above 4 percent.\nIn the euro zone, 18 percent of private sector workers and 22 percent of all workers are unionized.\nIn the U.S., 7.5 percent of private sector workers and 12 percent of all workers are unionized. Moreover, in\nEurope, big unions often engage in centralized negotiations with employer associations to set wages for\nlarge sectors of the labor force (WSJ, Aug. 22, 2008).\n9\n\nU.S. Outlook\nNow let me turn to the outlook for our own economy, starting with a brief look at\nconditions in Utah. This state had been among the nation’s fastest-growing in recent years;\nindeed in 2007, the pace of real GDP growth here—5¼ percent—placed it first among all\nstates. Not surprisingly, Utah also has had one of the lowest unemployment rates in the\nnation over the past few years. However, the national slowdown now seems to have caught\nup with Utah’s economy. Growth in the state has slowed noticeably this year, and the more\ngeneral slowdown in national consumer spending and travel activity has been reflected in a\ndrop in visitor counts and hotel occupancy rates in the state in recent months.\nTurning to the national economy, it was recently reported that growth in the second\nquarter came in at a fairly robust rate of 3¼ percent. This seems like good news--\nespecially considering what the economy has just been through. Growth slowed sharply in\nthe fourth quarter of last year, and, indeed, the data show that activity actually contracted\nslightly. Though growth turned positive in the first quarter, it was tepid at best.\nWhile one might be tempted to interpret the recent strong numbers as a sign that\nthings are turning around, there are three important reasons to think that the strength will\nnot hold up, and that economic performance will be decidedly subpar in the second half of\nthe year. First, consumer spending in the second quarter came in at only a moderate rate,\neven though it was boosted by substantial tax rebates. But there are no plans in place to\nrepeat those rebates, so by the fourth quarter, the economy will no longer benefit from that\nfiscal stimulus.\nSecond, export growth alone contributed one-half of the total real GDP growth\nregistered in the second quarter. This element has been an important source of strength in\n10\n\nour economy for over a year, being buoyed by strong growth abroad and by the weakening\nof the dollar. However, as I discussed, in recent months the dollar has risen somewhat and\neconomic growth in many of our industrialized trading partners has slowed or even turned\nnegative, suggesting that we can no longer count on exports as an important source of\nstrength.\nThird, the problems in the housing markets, financial markets, and labor markets\ncontinue to be a drag on growth and employment. Fortunately, the recent fall in\ncommodity prices should help to cushion some of this downward pressure on activity.\nOverall, I anticipate that real GDP growth in the second half of this year will come\nin below the growth of potential output which implies that the unemployment rate will rise.\nOn its own, this obviously is not good news. And its interaction with the housing and\nfinancial markets raises the potential for worse news—a deepening of the adverse feedback\nloop I’ve been describing: more unemployment causing more people to fall behind on their\nmortgage payments, leading to further delinquencies and foreclosures, tighter credit\nconditions and further downward pressure on activity and employment. This kind of\nprocess represents a downside risk for the economy, especially if it intensifies the sagging\nconsumer and business confidence we’ve seen.\nNow let me turn to inflation where recent performance has been a serious concern.\nAs of July, the headline PCE Price Index was up by a whopping 4¼ percent over the past\nyear, compared to 2½ percent over the prior year. An important reason why inflation was\nso high, of course, was because of the steep increases we experienced in food and energy\nprices. Moreover, the rise in commodity prices raised the costs of the wide array of\nbusinesses that use them as inputs and some have responded by passing those cost\n11\n\nincreases through to their own prices. The consequence is that core inflation, which\nexcludes food and energy is also up. The core PCE Price Index rose by 2½ percent over\nthe past twelve months, which is somewhat above the range that I consider consistent with\nprice stability, but close to its pace of increase over the last several years.\nWhat can we expect going forward? Headline inflation is likely to remain much\nhigher than I would like for a quarter or two as previous increases in commodity prices\nboost the prices paid by consumers for food and energy. With regard to core inflation, I\nwouldn’t be surprised if it runs modestly higher for a while, too, as businesses pass on\nsome of their higher energy, transportation, and other costs to customers. However, for\nseveral reasons, I expect both headline and core inflation to move down to a much more\nmoderate rate of just over 2 percent next year.\nOne obvious reason is the recent decline in commodity prices, and the prospect that\nthey will remain at present levels, thus ceasing to put direct upward pressure on headline\ninflation. Indeed, commodity prices may drop further. While this is by no means certain, it\ndoes seem more likely than it did just a few months ago since the odds have risen that\nactivity in most industrialized economies will weaken further, translating into downward\npressure on commodity prices. Furthermore, the current slack in labor and product markets\n—together with prospects for more slack in the future—will impart some downward\npressure on the growth of labor compensation. The pace of wage and salary increases has\nbeen modest and stable in recent years and a weak labor market may cause it to decline\neven further.\nBut there is more to inflation than these direct pressures. We also have to pay close\nattention to inflation expectations and the dynamics that they can generate. If the public\n12\n\nwere to conclude that the recent experience of high inflation will be long-lasting and not\ntemporary, then workers might demand higher compensation and firms might satisfy those\ndemands, setting off a wage-price dynamic that would be costly to unwind. I argued earlier\nthat such a wage-price spiral was less likely here than in Europe because our economy has\nless wage indexation than exists in the euro area. However, that does not mean that we can\nafford to ignore the risk that such a damaging spiral could develop here.\nFortunately, I do not see signs of this development at this point. First, the reports of\nour directors and business contacts are consistent with the view that no such dynamic has\ntaken hold. Outside of a few booming sectors such as energy, we hear no reports of\nescalating wage pressures even though higher food and energy prices have eroded the real\nincomes of American workers. Our contacts note that high unemployment is holding down\nlabor turnover, suppressing the need to raise wages more rapidly. The two broad measures\nof national labor compensation that we monitor have shown remarkably small increases\nrecently and over the past year. Taking productivity growth into account, growth in labor\ncosts per unit of output in the overall economy has been quite modest.\nMoreover, various measures of longer-term inflation expectations suggest that they\nremain relatively well contained. With the recent decline in commodity prices, inflation\nexpectations for the next five years have edged down slightly in both the Michigan Survey\nof households and the Philadelphia Fed’s Survey of Professional Forecasters. Furthermore,\nsince June, compensation for inflation and inflation risk over the next five years—as\nmeasured in markets for Treasury Inflation Protected Securities—has dropped noticeably\nand is now under 2 percent. For the period from 5 to 10 years ahead, compensation has\ndropped a bit and remains at the lower end of its trading range of recent years. In\n13\n\nsummary, it seems clear that inflation risks have diminished somewhat in recent months as\ncommodity prices have come down from their highs. But they have by no means\ndisappeared and are very much at the forefront of the FOMC’s attention.\nMonetary Policy\nThis brings me to my views on monetary policy. The Committee responded to the\ndifficult economic conditions that emerged last year by easing monetary policy\nsubstantially, cutting the federal funds rate to 2 percent, which is more than 3 full\npercentage points below where it was just last summer. Today, there is a great deal of\ndebate about just how accommodative the stance of policy actually is. This issue is\nespecially acute given that the Fed has been facing a difficult policy choice, with risks to\nboth economic activity and inflation.\nIn measuring the stance of policy, it’s common to look at the real federal funds rate\n—the nominal rate less a measure of the rate of inflation that is likely to prevail over the\nperiod ahead. For inflation, I have tended to use core PCE price inflation, that is, without\nthe effects of food and energy prices. Of course, food and energy are important costs faced\nby consumers, but I think it appropriate to exclude them in this computation because, as I\nargued, their effects on overall inflation are likely to be temporary. As a result, recent core\ninflation is often a good indicator of future overall inflation. In my view, this is true right\nnow. As I said earlier, core PCE price inflation averaged 2½ percent over the past year,\nwell below the 4¼ percent headline number, but I’m expecting both core and headline\ninflation to come in a bit over 2 percent in 2009 as a whole.\n14\n\nDoing the math leaves us with a slightly negative real federal funds rate. Does this\nmean that policy is highly accommodative? Normally, a negative real funds rate would\nimply that the answer is “yes” because it is typically associated with low borrowing costs\nand easy credit terms—that is, easy overall financial conditions. But, as I discussed,\noverall financial conditions are probably more restrictive now than when the financial crisis\nstruck a year ago, so the slightly negative real funds rate does not imply a highly\naccommodative policy stance. In other words, policy must be calibrated to push through\nthe substantial headwinds the economy faces. While the economy did well in the second\nquarter, that strength, as I indicated, is likely to prove ephemeral. My forecast is for\nsluggish growth in the second half of this year, with substantial downside risks—especially\nemanating from the financial system.\nOverall inflation over the past year has been unacceptably high. But, the prognosis\ngoing forward is favorable. Inflation expectations remain relatively well contained,\nreducing the chance that a wage-price spiral will develop. Moreover, if new lower\ncommodity prices hold, even at today’s high levels, we are likely to see improvements in\noverall and core consumer inflation coming through the pipeline soon.\nIn summary, the recent drop in commodity prices has improved the policy choice\nfacing the Committee. However, going forward, it is clear that we must keep a close eye\non both inflation and inflation expectations to ensure that we continue to earn the inflation\ncredibility that we have built up over the past two and a half decades.\n15",

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Creating a Just Economy,” the 2017 annual conference of the\nNational Community Reinvestment Coalition\nWashington, D.C.\nMarch 28, 2017\n\nThank you for this opportunity to be part of the National Community\nReinvestment Coalition’s annual conference. It is a pleasure to address a group of\norganizations committed to improving the lives of low- and moderate-income Americans\nand strengthening communities. I am especially pleased to be with you in 2017, which\nmarks the 40th anniversary of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA).\nAs you know, the CRA requires banks to help meet the credit needs of the\ncommunities they are chartered to serve, including low- and moderate-income\nneighborhoods. Since its enactment, the CRA has helped channel capital into\ncommunities and, in the process, supported innovative and effective approaches to\ncommunity development.\nWe at the Federal Reserve take our CRA responsibilities seriously. We evaluate\nthe CRA performance of the state-chartered banks we supervise and make the ratings and\nwritten evaluations public.1 We currently are improving our examination procedures and\nexaminer training. We also work with our fellow bank regulators to continually improve\nour implementation of the law. And, as many of you know, we recently revised our\ninteragency guidance to clarify how various community development activities are\nconsidered in assessing CRA performance, among them workforce development, which\nis my topic today.2\nWorkforce Development Initiatives and Challenges\nWorkforce development is a bit of a catchall phrase encompassing different types\nof initiatives that help prepare people for jobs by providing them with training, placement\n1 CRA information is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/crape/BankRating.aspx.\n2 See the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council’s CRA webpage “Interagency Questions and\nAnswers” available at https://www.ffiec.gov/cra/qnadoc.htm.\n\n- 2 -\nassistance, and other support. Organizations dedicated to providing workforce\ndevelopment are interested not just in helping people secure any jobs, but jobs that pay\nwell, provide benefits, offer opportunities for advancement, and are less likely to be\neliminated during economic downturns. Significant job market changes in recent years,\nbrought about by global competition and technological advances--and the new and\nshifting skills that these changes demand--make workforce development more important\nthan ever before.\nAs community development practitioners, you know that good-paying, stable jobs\nare not only important to workers and their families, but also are the foundation of strong\nneighborhoods. As part of our CRA responsibilities, the Federal Reserve, together with\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency, has made it clear that banks will receive CRA recognition for lending to,\ninvesting in, and providing services to workforce development initiatives. In fact, two\nFederal Reserve Banks recently published a framework describing how workforce\ndevelopment initiatives can fit within a bank’s broader CRA strategy.3\nWhile the job market for the United States as a whole has improved markedly\nsince the depths of the financial crisis, the persistently higher unemployment rates in\nlower-income and minority communities show why workforce development is so\nessential. For instance, unemployment rates averaged 13 percent in low- and moderate-\n3 See Elizabeth Sobel Blum and Steven Shepelwich (2017), Engaging Workforce Development: A\nFramework for Meeting CRA Obligations, Federal Reserve Banks of Dallas and Kansas City (Dallas: FRB\nDallas, January), https://www.dallasfed.org/-/media/Documents/cd/pubs/workforce.pdf?la=en.\n\n- 3 -\nincome communities from 2011 through 2015, compared with 7.3 percent in higher-\nincome communities.4\nThe challenges for workers in minority communities are even greater. The\naverage unemployment rate across all census tracts where minorities made up a majority\nof the population averaged 14.3 percent from 2011 through 2015. Also, a much smaller\nshare of the prime working-age population in these areas is employed--67.7 percent\nduring this period, which is nearly 9 percentage points lower than in communities with\nsmaller minority populations.5 These elevated unemployment rates and depressed\nemployment-to-population ratios underscore the strong need for effective workforce\ndevelopment options for these communities.\nEducation as a Workforce Development Strategy\nProbably the most important workforce development strategy is improving the\nquality of general education. The rapid rise in U.S. education levels in the 20th century,\nfacilitated by the growing availability of high school education in the first part of the\ncentury and the rapid expansion of public universities after World War II, contributed\nenormously to the broad-based economic gains associated with that period.6 But,\nunfortunately, for a wide variety of reasons that are beyond the scope of this talk,\neducation levels have historically lagged in low- and moderate-income communities,\n4 Low- and moderate-income communities are census tracts with a family median income under 80 percent\nof the area median income. Higher-income communities are census tracts with median incomes of 80\npercent of the area median income or greater. Statistics represent the average of census tract\nunemployment rates rather than the unemployment rate across all individuals in these tracts combined.\n5 Prime-age workers are those who are aged 25 to 54. Statistics are from the American Community Survey\n(ACS) data releases from 2011 through 2015, available on the U.S. Census Bureau’s website at\nhttps://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs.\n6 See Claudia Goldin (2001), “The Human-Capital Century and American Leadership: Virtues of the Past,”\nJournal of Economic History, vol. 61 (June), pp. 263-92, https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-\ncambridge-core/content/view/S0022050701028017.\n\n- 4 -\nparticularly communities of color. Between 2011 and 2015, the average proportion of\nadults in low- and moderate-income communities who had dropped out of high school\nwas 23.5 percent, which is more than double the 10.9 percent rate in higher-income\ncommunities during that period.7\nWhen students from low- and moderate-income families do complete high\nschool, they are less likely to pursue a college degree. And when they do attend college,\nthose students are less likely to graduate.8 Among the reasons for the disparity are a lack\nof money to pay for college and the burden of family responsibilities.9 As a result, the\nproportion of adults in low- and moderate-income communities from 2011 through 2015\nwho had a four-year college degree or graduate degree was about half the share in higher-\nincome communities--17.6 percent versus 34 percent.10\nThis educational disparity matters because, among many reasons, people with less\neducation experience both higher unemployment and lower average earnings. In\nDecember 2016, for example, the unemployment rate for people aged 25 and older with a\nbachelor’s or higher degree was only 2.6 percent. However, the rate was nearly double,\n7 Adults are defined here as individuals aged 25 and older. Statistics are from the ACS data releases from\n2011 through 2015; see note 5.\n8 Following a cohort of high school sophomores in 2002, 96 percent of students from a high\nsocioeconomic-status family pursued at least some higher education and 60 percent completed a bachelor’s\ndegree. Among students from a low socioeconomic-status family, 72 percent pursued higher education and\n14 percent completed a bachelor’s degree. Socioeconomic status is based on family income and parents’\neducation. See National Center for Education Statistics (2015), “Postsecondary Attainment: Differences\nby Socioeconomic Status,” in The Condition of Education 2015 (Washington: NCES),\nhttps://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/pdf/coe_tva.pdf.\n9 Many people who did not enroll for or did not complete a degree also gave as a reason that they wanted to\nwork, which may also reflect budget constraints that made pursuing or completing a higher education\ndifficult. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2016), Report on the Economic Well-\nBeing of U.S. Families in 2015 (Washington: Board of Governors, May),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/2015-report-economic-well-being-us-households-201605.pdf.\n10 See note 7.\n\n- 5 -\n5.1 percent, for workers in this age group with only a high school diploma and about\ntriple, 7.9 percent, for those without a high school degree.11\nWhile high school graduates earn somewhat more than people who did not finish\nhigh school, the big payoff comes with a four-year college or advanced degree.12 The\nadvantages of higher education, evidenced by lower unemployment rates and higher\nearnings, are clear across the spectrum but are greater for non-Hispanic whites than for\nAfrican Americans and Hispanics.\nImproving educational levels in low- and moderate-income communities is a\nlong-term task. At least partially because of a lack of early childhood education and the\nsometimes lower quality of schools, children in these neighborhoods score substantially\nlower on standardized tests and drop out of high school at higher rates.13 Thus, a starting\npoint is to improve access to quality education in early childhood and improve the quality\nof primary and secondary schooling.\n11 Moreover, “over 95 percent of jobs created during the recovery have gone to workers with at least some\ncollege education, while those with a high school diploma or less are being left behind” (as quoted from the\nintroduction on the webpage for Anthony P. Carnevale, Tamara Jayasundera, and Artem Gulish (2016),\nAmerica’s Divided Recovery: College Haves and Have-Nots (Washington: Georgetown University Center\nfor Education and the Workforce), https://cew.georgetown.edu/cew-reports/americas-divided-recovery).\nAlso see Bureau of Labor Statistics (2017), “The Employment Situation--February 2017,” news release,\nMarch 10, Table A-4: Employment Status of the Civilian Population 25 Years and over by Educational\nAttainment, https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t04.htm; and BLS (2017), “Labor Force Statistics\nfrom the Current Population Survey,” March 10, Table A-10: Unemployment Rates by Age, Sex, and\nMarital Status, Seasonally Adjusted, https://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cpseea10.htm.\n12 The median weekly earnings for men with a high school degree but no college was $779, and for women\nit was $603.

Reardon (2016), School District Socioeconomic Status, Race, and Academic Achievement,\npaper, Stanford Center for Education Policy Analysis (Stanford: Stanford CEPA),\nhttps://cepa.stanford.edu/content/school-district-socioeconomic-status-race-and-academic-achievement;\nMotoko Rich, Amanda Cox, and Matthew Bloch (2016), “Money, Race and Success: How Your School\nDistrict Compares,” New York Times, April 29,\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/04/29/upshot/money-race-and-success-how-your-school-district-\ncompares.html; and Geoffrey T. Wodtke, David J. Harding, and Felix Elwert (2011), “Neighborhood\nEffects in Temporal Perspective,” American Sociological Review, vol.76 (October), pp. 713-36.\n\n- 6 -\nWe must also recognize and address the barriers faced by low- and moderate-\nincome students trying to attain higher levels of education--barriers not typically faced by\ntheir more well-off peers. First, these students often do not have friends or family who\nhave achieved higher educational levels, which matters because students whose parents\ndid not attend college are much less likely to pursue a college degree themselves.14 Even\nso, these students can benefit from high school counselors or other mentors who can\nassist them in choosing schools that provide the financial and counseling support that will\nhelp them complete their degrees. And they can benefit from help in picking majors and\ndegrees that lead to higher earnings. 15\nSecond, lower-income students often pursue their education while working to\nsupport themselves and family members. Educational programs that help students\nbalance these competing responsibilities go a long way to improving completion rates. In\nrecognition of this fact, the U.S. Department of Education is offering competitive grants\nto postsecondary institutions to support or establish campus-based childcare programs\nprimarily serving the needs of low-income students.16\nI want to reiterate that addressing the particular barriers standing in the way of\nlower-income students attending college and earning a degree requires a long-term\n14 For example, 65 percent of young adults (aged 25 to 34) with a parent who received a bachelor’s degree\ncompleted one themselves, compared with 16 percent of young adults whose parents completed no\neducation beyond high school.

However, not every student wants a two- or four-year degree or will have the\nfinancial wherewithal to pursue and complete a postsecondary degree. To support\nprograms aimed at students not bound for college, in 2015, the Federal Reserve Banks of\nPhiladelphia, Cleveland, and Atlanta identified occupations with above-average wages\nfor workers without a bachelor's degree in the country’s 100 largest metropolitan areas.17\nThe Reserve Banks made this information available to workforce development providers\nonline and in workshops. Educational programs and training that lead to better paying\nand more steady work are crucial for people without college degrees, particularly lower-\nincome workers.\nWorkforce Development Programs in Action\nIn the rest of my remarks, I would like to highlight some examples of successful\ninitiatives that illustrate key features of effective workforce development.18 As you\nknow, within our community affairs offices, the Federal Reserve devotes considerable\neffort to studying and promoting effective workforce development, so I am able to draw\n17 Top occupations noted across all MSAs included the following: registered nurses; first-line supervisors\nof office and administrative support workers; sales representatives, wholesale and manufacturing; business\noperations specialists, sales representative services; general and operations managers; computer system\nanalysts; automotive service technicians and mechanics; first-line supervisors of construction trades and\nextraction work; plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters; first-line supervisors of mechanics, installers; and\nconstruction laborers. See Keith Wardrip, Kyle Fee, Lisa Nelson, and Stuart Andreason, Identifying\nOpportunity Occupations in the Nation’s Largest Metropolitan Economies, Federal Reserve Banks of\nPhiladelphia, Cleveland, and Ohio (Cleveland: FSB of Cleveland), available at\nhttps://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/publications/special-reports/sr-20150909-identifying-\nopportunity-occupations.aspx.\n18 For a broad summary of recent research and policy issues related to workforce development, see the 2015\npublication Transforming U.S. Workforce Development Policies for the 21st Century (available at\nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/publications/community/transformworkforce) developed by the Federal\nReserve Banks of Atlanta and Kansas City in partnership with the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce\nDevelopment at Rutgers University. In addition, all Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors are\ncurrently engaged in a System workforce development initiative that will gather up-to-date perspectives\nfrom employers and organizations engaged in worker training and education. This initiative will include a\nseries of regional Reserve Bank meetings, a publication on effective investments and outcomes, and a\ncapstone conference in October in Austin, Texas.\n\n- 8 -\non the knowledge and experience of our staff. In discussing the examples, I would like to\nmake five points.\nFirst, it is crucial for younger workers to establish a solid connection to\nemployment early in their work lives. The Federal Reserve’s 2013 Survey of Young\nWorkers found that 18- to 30-year-olds with early work experience were more likely to\nemerge from the recent recession with a permanent job.19 Other studies have found that\nstudents who worked 20 hours per week in their senior year of high school earned higher\nwages later in life than those who did not, and that summer youth employment programs\nimproved participants’ attitudes toward their communities, raised their academic\naspirations, and boosted their job readiness skills.20 The findings point to some of the\nreasons that the Boston Fed decided to lend technical support to a pilot program called\nPocket Change, which aims to reduce unemployment among low-income 18- to 24-year-\nolds in Somerville, Massachusetts, through internships, training in job skills, and\nreinforcement of important soft skills such as punctuality and effective communication.\nIn its first two years, the initiative trained 53 low-income young people and placed 20 of\nthem in jobs. The results of this modest program indicate the promise of efforts that\n19 The survey found that 82 percent of workers who had worked for pay during high school had a\npermanent job--4 percentage points higher than for all workers combined. See Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System (2014), In the Shadow of the Great Recession: Experiences and Perspectives of\nYoung Workers (Washington: Board of Governors, November),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/2013-experiences-and-perspectives-of-young-workers-\n201411.pdf.\n20 Baum and Ruhm (2016) do observe, however, that these gains from employment during the\nsenior year of high school have diminished substantially relative to earlier cohorts. See Charles L.\nBaum and Christopher J. Ruhm (2016), “The Changing Benefits of Early Work Experience,”\nSouthern Economic Journal, vol. 83 (October), pp. 343-63.\n\n- 9 -\nfocus on first-time work experiences, and Somerville is now seeking to expand the\ninitiative.21\nMy second observation is that career and technical education (CTE) programs,\nwhich have seen a revival in recent years, have considerable potential. For some time,\nvocational education had fallen out of favor or was in decline in the United States, as it\nwas associated with the deleterious practice of “tracking” less advantaged students that\ndenied them the opportunity for the best education. But more recently, CTE has been\nrefined and has made a comeback as an effective way to help non-college-bound workers\ngain valuable skills and obtain a foothold in a labor market that increasingly requires\ntechnical proficiency. These programs teach the skills needed to pursue careers in fields\nsuch as construction, manufacturing, health care, information technology, hospitality, and\nfinancial services.\nThis point brings me to my third observation, which is that effective CTE\nprograms and other workforce development initiatives are able to match education and\ntraining to good-paying jobs when they actively engage employers in the training\nprocess. WorkAdvance, a regional sector-specific program, is a good example. It\ndelivers an array of aligned services to meet local business needs and provide jobs for\nunemployed and low-income adults in multiple cities.22 An evaluation of the program\nlast year in Tulsa, New York City, and northeast Ohio found it was especially effective\n21 For more information on Pocket Change, see the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s Working Cities\nChallenge webpage at\nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/workingcities/massachusetts/round1/cities/somerville.html.\n22 Aligned services may include intensive screening, occupational skills training, job development and\nplacement services, and retention and advancement services.\n\n- 10 -\nbecause it offered training for in-demand skills and industry-recognized certifications,\nand it focused on jobs that have clear paths for advancement.23\nA fourth observation is that apprenticeships, which are more common in other\ncountries, could play a larger role for low- and moderate-income individuals in our\ncountry as part of broader career and technical education efforts. For instance, a state-run\nprogram in South Carolina, Apprenticeship Carolina, helps employers develop\napprenticeships at no cost to them. Businesses receive a $1,000 annual tax credit per\napprenticeship, and the program assists them with information and technical needs,\npaperwork, and the integration of classroom learning at local technical colleges. The\nprogram has led to sizable job gains at a modest cost to the state.24 Similarly,\nWashington State registered apprenticeship programs contributed to substantial long-term\nincreases in employment rates and hourly wages.25\nMy fifth and final observation is that promoting entrepreneurship could play a\ngreater role in workforce development. Entrepreneurship is a fundamental strength of the\nAmerican economy, and owning your own business or working for yourself can offer\nincome, a means of building wealth, and, sometimes, greater flexibility for balancing job\nand family commitments. Yet we see less self-employment in low- and moderate-income\n23 For more on the WorkAdvance program, see the MDRC website at\nwww.mdrc.org/project/workadvance#overview, and for information on that program in Northeast Ohio, see\nthe Towards Employment website at http://towardsemployment.org/strategic-initiatives/workadvance.\n24 See Harry J. Holzer and Robert I. Lerman (2014), Work-Based Learning to Expand Jobs and\nOccupational Qualifications for Youth (Washington: Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, April),\nwww.cbpp.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/4-2-14fe-holzer.pdf.\n25 Kevin Hollenbeck and Wei-Jang Huang (2014), “Net Impact and Benefit-Cost Estimates of the\nWorkforce Development System in Washington State,” Upjohn Institute Technical Report 13-029\n(Kalamazoo, Mich.: W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research), http://dx.doi.org/10.17848/tr13-\n029.\n\n- 11 -\ncommunities.26 Moreover, when businesses are owned by minorities, they are less likely\nto have paid employees.27 These findings speak to the opportunities that could be\nrealized by helping people start their own businesses and then helping them grow their\nbusinesses. Programs that equip people with the management skills and knowledge they\nneed to start and operate a successful small business can help. Relevant and effective\ntraining can reduce the failure rate of businesses by helping owners make better decisions\nand avoid costly mistakes.28 These programs are especially critical in low-income and\nrural communities where other resources to support small business development may be\nscarce.\nAs part of their community affairs work, several Federal Reserve Banks have\nsmall business development initiatives. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York\norganized a small business protection and education series last year in partnership with\nthe Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce and a local development corporation. Participants\nlearned about capital resources available to small businesses, online credit alternatives for\nsmall businesses, and the risks of handling large volumes of cash. In another example,\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City developed a guide to help rural and smaller\n26 From 2011 through 2015, only 8 percent of households in low- and moderate-income communities\nreported self-employment income, compared with 11 percent of all households (see ACS data releases in\nnote 5).\n27 Only 4 percent of African American-owned firms and 9 percent of Hispanic-owned firms have paid\nemployees, compared with 22 percent of non-minority-owned firms; see U.S. Department of Commerce,\nMinority Business Development Agency (2016), “U.S. Minority-Owned Firms,” fact sheet (Washington:\nMBDA, January), www.mbda.gov/sites/default/files/2012SBO_MBEFactSheet020216.pdf.\n28 See Glenn Muske and Nancy Stanforth (2000), “The Educational Needs of Small Business Owners: A\nLook into the Future,” Journal of Extension, vol. 38 (December),\nhttps://www.joe.org/joe/2000december/a4.php.\n\n- 12 -\nmetropolitan communities promote conditions favorable to growing local businesses\nrather than relying only on efforts to attract large companies.29\nOf course, in addition to training, small business owners need financing. But, as\nmany of you know, factors such as lack of a credit history or a poor credit history and\nlimited collateral--for example, home equity--make it difficult for the owners of small\nenterprises to access traditional business credit.

    "text": "Portland Community Leaders’ Luncheon\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nJuly 29, 2005, 12:30 PM Pacific Time, 3:30 PM Eastern Time\nViews on the Economy and Implications for Monetary Policy\nThank you for that very kind introduction. It’s a pleasure to be here with you in this\nbeautiful “City of Roses.” As a monetary policymaker, my main concern is the national\neconomy, and that will be the chief focus of my remarks today. But as President of the San\nFrancisco Fed, I also pay close attention to developments here in the Twelfth District, which, in\nmany respects, mirror those of the nation.\nLooking at the big picture elements—growth, employment, and inflation—I’d say things\nare in reasonably good shape. Over the past two years, the nation’s output growth has been\npretty steady, averaging just over four percent; this is solidly above trend, which, by most\nestimates, is around three and a quarter to three and a half percent. This growth has been amply\nin evidence here in the Pacific Northwest. While unemployment rates in Oregon and\nWashington remain above the nation’s rate, your region has largely recovered from the severe hit\nyou took during the 2001 recession and its aftermath. As a result of sustained growth at the\nnational level, slack in labor and product markets has trended down. At 5.0 percent, the national\nunemployment rate now stands near conventional estimates of the natural rate consistent with\n“full employment.” When it comes to inflation, I focus on core measures, which exclude the\nvolatile food and energy components, to assess underlying trends. Two different measures of\ncore inflation have given slightly different signals in recent months: one—the core CPI—is well\nwithin my comfort zone; the other—the core PCE—is at the upper end. However, I expect to see\nsome moderation in inflation going forward. Similarly, most forecasters expect the pace of\neconomic activity also to moderate toward trend-like growth. Given all this, it seems to me that\nthe economy is on track to achieve price stability and “maximum employment”—the dual goals\nassigned to monetary policy by the Federal Reserve Act—and that we’ll likely continue to move\nin a positive direction over the next couple of years.\nThis sounds like a rosy scenario and I realize that it ignores all of the things that could go\nwrong. You might well ask, “What about oil prices?” “What about the record trade deficit?”\n“What about the possibility of a housing bubble?” “What about the ‘conundrum’ of surprisingly\nlow long-term interest rates?” Well, indeed—what about them? You would be right to ask.\nThese questions touch on important economic developments that create risks for the positive\nscenario I just described. They therefore receive serious attention at the policy table. From my\nperspective, trying to assess such risks is what makes the conduct of monetary policy both\ninteresting and challenging.\nInflation risks\nLet me start by looking at some of the factors that create risks for the inflation outlook and\nexplain why I’m nevertheless fairly optimistic that inflation will moderate over the next few\nyears. Of course, oil prices do pose an inflation risk. The price of oil has just about doubled\nover the past two years, from the low $30 range to around $60 per barrel recently. Higher oil\nprices are reflected in higher “headline” inflation. And they have been passed through to some\nextent to core inflation as well, but, unless they rise further, the effect on core inflation should\n1\n\nbegin to dissipate next year. Another risk relates to labor compensation, which is the single\nlargest component of business costs. Recently, one measure of compensation per hour jumped\nabruptly. Here, too, though, I am not terribly worried because a good part of the jump is\nprobably accounted for by one-time events, such as bonus payments and the exercising of stock\noptions. This interpretation is supported by readings from an alternative measure of labor\ncompensation, the Employment Cost Index, which excludes these items and has recorded only\nmodest increases.\nI’m also quite encouraged by several developments that portend a moderation in inflation\ngoing forward. For example, even with the recent revaluation of the Chinese renminbi, the dollar\nhas increased by 7½ percent against major currencies so far this year, which should take some of\nthe pressure off of import prices. In addition, inflation expectations, which may affect wage and\nprice setting, appear to be edging lower: We see this both in survey results and in the financial\nmarkets—through noticeable declines in “inflation compensation”, measured by the difference\nbetween the yields on Treasury bonds with and without inflation protection. A third factor is\nproductivity growth. There have been concerns that a structural productivity slowdown was in\nthe offing, which could put upward pressure on inflation; the good news is that structural\nproductivity growth apparently still remains above the levels reached during the second half of\nthe 1990s, although it may have edged down just a bit over the last few years.\nA final factor impacting the inflation outlook is the degree of slack in the labor market.\nRight now, the unemployment rate is relatively low: at 5 percent it’s near most estimates of the\nso-called natural rate. But other measures—such as the employment-population ratio, a survey\nof job market perceptions, and industrial capacity utilization—suggest that some slack still\nremains.\nRisks to economic growth and employment\nNow let me turn to the real side of the economy—growth and employment—and highlight some\nof the risks that affect my optimistic baseline projection. Even though overall growth has been\nrespectable, economic activity has been burdened by some major drags over the past year or so.\nThree major ones result from the oil price shock, the deterioration of the trade balance, and a still\nrelatively low level of business investment spending.\nAs I mentioned, the price of oil has just about doubled over the past two years. Typically,\nthe markets view oil price jumps as temporary. But this time around, far-dated oil futures prices\nalso have increased sharply, suggesting that the high prices may be here to stay. This is a highly\nunusual development. Most likely, it reflects the perception that there is little excess supply of\noil available in the world and that global demand is likely to remain strong. The perception that\nthe oil price shock is more permanent tends to intensify its negative effect on spending.\nEstimates suggest that the oil price shock has noticeably restrained real GDP growth—by about\nthree quarters of a percentage point in 2005. This impact is certainly nontrivial. However, it is\nworth emphasizing that the recent price change and spending impacts are far smaller than those\nof the oil shocks in the 1970s.\nThe U.S. trade deficit, as we all know very well, has been growing rapidly for years. By\nthe end of last year, it topped five and three-quarters percent of GDP, a new record. Two of the\nmajor factors contributing to the sizable imbalance between our imports and our exports are the\n2\n\nstrength of the U.S. economy relative to our major trading partners and the relative strength of\nthe dollar. In 2004, the increase in the trade deficit—by itself—subtracted almost one percentage\npoint from real GDP growth, representing a significant drag on overall activity.\nFinally, while business investment in equipment and software rose strongly last year, by\nalmost 14 percent, the level of investment is still not as high relative to GDP as we’d expect,\ngiven favorable economic conditions and firms’ healthy balance sheets. Economic growth has\nbeen solid for a few years now. And, with the very low level of interest rates, borrowing costs\ncan’t be the problem. Moreover, profit margins have been high for some time, so firms are\ncertainly not strapped for cash. The shortfall might be due to business caution, perhaps related\nto reverberations from 9/11 and subsequent terrorist threats and actions or perhaps to the\ncorporate governance scandals and the adjustments required by the legislation that followed\nthem. Alternatively, the investment shortfall might reflect the perception by businesses that\nproductivity gains can be realized at this stage that do not require major new investments in\nequipment and software.\nWhatever the explanation, the consequence of these drags is that the Fed had to keep\ninterest rates exceptionally low for a long time just to get respectable, but not stellar, economic\ngrowth. In fact, the federal funds rate was lowered all the way to 1 percent and held there until\nthe middle of last year. Since then, the FOMC has raised the funds rate nine times to 3¼ percent,\nbut it still remains in a range normally considered stimulative.\nBond rate conundrum\nIncreases in the federal funds rate typically lead to increases in longer-term interest rates. But, as\nwe all know, long-term rates have actually fallen as the FOMC has raised short-term rates. For\nexample, the benchmark ten-year Treasury rate is down by more than ½ percentage point since\nthe funds rate started heading up in the middle of last year. This is the basis for what Chairman\nGreenspan has called the bond rate “conundrum” that has commanded so much attention\nrecently.\nThere is a debate about how to interpret the decline in longer term yields and it\nessentially boils down to whether the surprising behavior of long rates is due to various “special\nfactors” operating independently of the current business cycle or instead augurs bad economic\nnews on the horizon. If special factors are holding down long term yields, then the total amount\nof stimulus to spending from interest rates is currently greater than would be surmised on the\nbasis of the current federal funds rate. In effect, unusually low long-term bond rates are now\nproviding extra stimulus to offset the drags I described. A number of “special factors” might be\nat work to flatten the yield curve. One possibility is that low bond rates reflect a drop in risk\npremiums because inflation has become better anchored and the volatility of the real economy\nhas fallen. But let me also note that other factors would seem to work in the opposite direction—\nfor example, our large and growing federal budget and trade imbalances could be raising risk\npremiums.\nAnother possibility is that low long-term rates reflect unusually strong demand for long-\nterm securities, for example, by pension funds seeking to improve the match between the\ndurations of their assets and liabilities, by holders of mortgage-backed securities seeking to\nmaintain the durations of their portfolios, or by foreign central banks that have been acquiring\n3\n\ndollars. China may have been playing an especially large role, as its central bank has intervened\nin foreign exchange markets to peg the renminbi at a low level against the dollar. Of course, last\nweek the People’s Bank of China announced that it had revalued the renminbi against the dollar\nby 2.1 percent, with the stated intention of managing the renminbi’s exchange value against an\nunspecified currency basket. This is not a large revaluation, but some observers think that it is\nthe beginning of a much bigger move over time. If this is the case, we may gain a better\nunderstanding of the impact, if any, that Chinese exchange rate policy has had on U.S. bond\nrates.\nAn alternative to “special factors” as an explanation for the low level of long-term yields\nis the possibility that the flat yield curve reflects the market’s assessment that bad news is on the\nhorizon. In other words, investors may expect only modest increases in the funds rate in the\nfuture because they think that the drags I’ve described will keep demand on the weak side for\nsome time to come.\nWe probably won’t know the most important sources of this “conundrum” until more\ntime passes, but the causes of the conundrum do matter to monetary policy. If the first class of\nexplanations turns out to be correct, the federal funds rate probably needs to be somewhat higher\nthan would otherwise be appropriate to offset the additional stimulus due to the flat yield curve.\nIf the latter explanation fits the bill, and the market is correct that the drags going forward will be\nunusually strong, a somewhat easier policy may be appropriate.\nHousing\nWhatever the source of the conundrum, clearly low long-term rates have contributed to the\ncontinuing boom in the housing market. The share of residential investment in GDP is now at its\nhighest level in decades. The question on everyone’s mind, of course, is whether this source of\nstrength in the economy could reverse course and become instead a source of weakness. Put\nmore bluntly: Is there a housing “bubble” that might collapse, and if so, what would that mean\nfor the economy? To begin to answer this question, we need to know what we mean by the term\n“bubble.” A bubble does not just mean that prices are rising rapidly—it’s more complicated than\nthat. Instead, a bubble means that the price of an asset—in this case, housing—is significantly\nhigher than its fundamental value.\nOne common way of thinking about housing’s fundamental value is to consider the ratio\nof housing prices to rents. The price-to-rent ratio is equivalent to the price-to-dividend ratio for\nstocks. In the case of housing, rents reflect the flow of benefits obtained from housing assets—\neither the monetary return from rental property, or the value of living in owner-occupied\nhousing. Historically, the ratio for the nation as a whole has had many ups and downs, but over\ntime it has tended to return to its long-run average. Thus, when the price-to-rent ratio is high,\nhousing prices tend to grow more slowly or fall for a time, and when the ratio is low, prices tend\nto rise more rapidly. I want to emphasize, though, that this is a loose relationship that can be\ncounted on only for rough guidance rather than a precise reading.\nCurrently, the ratio for the country is higher than at any time since data became available\nin 1970—about 25 percent above its long-run average. Of course, the results vary widely from\nplace to place. For Los Angeles and San Francisco, the price-to-rent ratio is about 40 percent\nhigher than the normal level, while for Cleveland the ratio is very near its historical average.1\n4\n\nCloser to home, the figure for Seattle is just over 35. For Portland, it turns out that the\nprice-to-rent ratio is a bit anomalous. Unlike the ratio for the nation and many of the cities I’ve\nmentioned, Portland’s ratio has been trending up, and this pattern has been going on since the\nlate 1980s. This means that there’s not a stable long-run average ratio to use as a comparison for\ntoday’s ratio, so the analysis we did for the other cities wouldn’t be that meaningful for Portland.\nWhat we do know is that the pace of home price appreciation in Portland has been close to the\nnational pace over the past few years, lagging behind somewhat in 2003 as the state struggled to\nrecover from the 2001 recession, but mostly catching up in 2004 and early 2005 as economic\ngrowth picked up noticeably in the state. As of early this year, home prices in the Portland area\nwere up 12 percent over a year earlier, only a bit below the national pace of 12½ percent. More\nrecently, I’ve heard reports that upscale homes in the Portland area are increasingly being sold at\nabove-asking price—a phenomenon we’re all too familiar with in the Bay Area! So it’s clear\nthat Portland’s housing market has been hot, but I’m sure that’s no surprise to you.\nIn any event, as I said before, the fact that the ratios for the nation and many areas of the\ncountry are higher than normal doesn’t necessarily prove that there’s a bubble. House prices\ncould be high for some good reasons that affect their fundamental value. The most obvious\nreason is the low level of mortgage rates. This stems both from very stimulative monetary policy\nand from the conundrum I discussed earlier. Conventional mortgage rates have dropped from\naround 6 percent in early 2004 to around 5 percent recently.\nOther factors could also be raising housing’s fundamental value. For example, recent\nchanges in tax laws may be having an effect. In 1998, tax rates on capital gains were lowered\nand the exemption from capital gains taxation for housing was raised to $500,000. Both of these\nchanges would reduce the potential tax bite from selling one home and buying another. Another\ndevelopment, which may be making housing more like an investment vehicle, is that it’s now\neasier and cheaper to get at the equity—either through refinancing, which has become a less\ncostly process, or through an equity line of credit. Both of these innovations in mortgage\nmarkets make the funds invested in houses more liquid.\nSo there are good reasons to think that fundamental factors have played a role in the\nunusually high price-to-rent ratio. But the bottom line here is fuzzy. It’s very hard to say how\nbig a role these factors have played, so we don’t know how much remains unexplained. Frankly,\neven the best available estimates are imprecise, and they don’t definitively answer the question:\nIs there a bubble, and if there is, how large is it?\nGiven this uncertainty, my focus as a monetary policymaker is on trying to understand\nwhat kind of risks a drop in house prices would pose for the economy. One of the classic ways\nto do this is to ask “What if…?”—in other words, to pose a purely hypothetical question. In this\ncase, the “what if” question might be, “What’s the likely effect if national house prices did fall\nby 25 percent, enough to bring the price-to-rent ratio back to its historical average?” Before\ngoing any further, I want to emphasize that I’m not making any predictions about house price\nmovements, but instead, simply discussing how a prudent monetary policymaker could assess the\nrisk.\nFirst, there would be an effect on consumers’ wealth. With housing wealth nearing $18\ntrillion today, such a drop in house prices would extinguish about $4½ trillion of household\nwealth—equal to about 38 percent of GDP. Standard estimates suggest that for each dollar of\n5\n\nwealth lost, households tend to cut back on spending by around 3½ cents. This amounts to a\ndecrease in consumer spending of about 1¼ percent of GDP. To get some perspective on how\nbig the effect would be, it’s worth comparing it with the stock market decline that began in early\n2000. In that episode, the extinction of wealth was much greater—stock market wealth fell by\n$8½ trillion from March 2000 to the end of 2002. This suggests that if house prices were to drop\nby 25 percent, the impact on the economy might be about half what it was when the stock market\nturned down a few years ago.\nMoreover, the spending pullback wouldn’t happen all of a sudden. Wealth effects—\npositive or negative—tend to affect spending with fairly long lags. So, a drop in house prices\nprobably would lead to a gradual cutback in spending, giving the Fed time to respond by\nlowering short-term interest rates and keeping the economy steady.\nNow let’s complicate things. Suppose house prices started falling because bond and\nmortgage interest rates started rising as the conundrum was resolved, say, because the risk\npremium in bonds rose due to concerns about federal budget deficits or other factors. Then we’d\nhave the cutback in spending because of the wealth effect, plus there’d likely be further spending\ncutbacks, as borrowing costs for households rose. Furthermore, a rise in long-term rates would\nhave effects beyond just households—it also would dampen business investment in capital goods\nthrough a higher cost of capital.\nHow manageable would this scenario be? Like the wealth effect, these added interest-\nrate effects operate with a lag, so, again, there probably would be time for monetary policy to\nrespond by lowering short-term interest rates. This obviously would not be a “slam dunk,” but in\nmany circumstances it would seem manageable.\nA matter of more concern is whether this scenario would lead to financial disruptions that\ncould cause spending to slow sharply and quickly. One issue that receives a lot of attention is the\nincreasing use of potentially riskier types of loans, like variable rate and interest-only loans that\nmay make borrowers and lenders vulnerable to a fall in house prices or increase in interest rates.\nI believe that the odds of widespread financial disruption on this count are fairly slim, although,\nclearly, some borrowers are vulnerable. First, the shift to these new instruments appears\nrelatively modest overall. Second, the equity cushions available to both borrowers and lenders\nstill seem, on average, to be pretty substantial. This is evident in looking at loan-to-value ratios,\nwhich have fallen, on average, as home valuations have risen faster than mortgage debt. In\naddition, most financial institutions enjoy comfortable capital positions, so they’re better able to\nweather any problems with their mortgage portfolios. Finally, some of the risk associated with\nmortgages has been transferred from banks to investors, as banks have sold off securitized\nbundles of mortgage debt. These investors may be in a better position to handle the associated\nrisk. So, while there undoubtedly would be some fallout from a substantial drop in house prices,\nthe financial system and consumers appear to be in reasonably good shape to handle the\nsituation.\nMonetary policy\nI’d like to close my remarks by taking a step back from the home price story and putting it in the\nbroader context of the economy’s overall performance—which, after all, is the chief concern of\nmonetary policymakers. As I’ve emphasized, economic activity has been burdened by some\n6\n\nmajor drags over the past several years. As a result, the Fed has had to keep interest rates\nexceptionally low for a long time just to get respectable economic growth. In fact, respectable\ngrowth is all we have gotten—even with exceptionally low long-term yields and unexpectedly\nrapid gains in house prices.\nThis growth has had to rest on the backs of just a few interest-sensitive sectors—business\ninvestment, consumer durables, and housing. From this perspective, it’s not all that surprising\nthat housing markets have been hot. My point is that to offset the “drags” we’ve needed to give\nthe economy a strong dose of stimulus—which inevitably boosted the housing sector.\nAs I’ve discussed, if a sizable reversal in house prices were to occur, it probably would\naffect the economy mainly through the lagged effects of declines in wealth and increases in\ninterest rates, rather than through widespread financial disruptions. This would give monetary\npolicy time to react to any resulting economic weakness by lowering interest rates. In addition,\nthe magnitude of the potential house price overvaluation may be only around half that of the\nearlier stock market overvaluation.\nIn conclusion, policy still appears to be somewhat accommodative, and given the recent\ninflation performance and the dwindling of slack, it makes sense to continue the process of\nremoving that accommodation.\nI hope I’ve provided you with some insight on the issues that I think are important to\nfocus on as the Fed goes through this process. I look forward to taking your questions.\n1\nErratum (posted November 7, 2005). The statement about the U.S. data beginning in 1970 is correct as\nit stands.

    "text": "Presentation to Securities Analysts of San Francisco and Global Association of\nRisk Professionals\nSan Francisco, California\nBy Janet L. Yellen,∗ President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery, Thursday, October 21, 2004, 3:15 PM Pacific Time, 6:15 PM Eastern\nPerspectives on the National Economy and Monetary Policy\nGood afternoon. I’d like to thank you for inviting me here today to discuss my views on\nthe nation’s economy and on monetary policy.\nI know that I’m in the midst of a group of professionals who specialize in risk\nmanagement. Since risk management is a focus of our work at the Fed, we have much in\ncommon. Indeed, I understand that some people on the staff of the San Francisco Fed who work\nin this area are members of the Global Association of Risk Professionals, one of the co-hosts of\ntoday’s meeting. One of the Fed’s key roles is to address issues of risk in the financial services\nsector. We supervise state banks that are members of the Federal Reserve as well as bank and\nfinancial holding companies. During the last decade, our examinations have become\nincreasingly centered on the ability of the institutions we supervise to measure, monitor, and\nmanage risk. Improvements in the risk management techniques employed in these organizations\nhave, in my opinion, made our financial system far more resilient to shocks. Financial\ninstitutions weathered the Russian default, the turmoil caused by the collapse of Long Term\nCapital Management, the bursting of the stock market bubble, and the recent economic downturn\nexceptionally well.\n∗ The opinions expressed in this speech are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Federal\nReserve Bank of San Francisco or of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n1\n\nA completely different responsibility that involves significant elements of risk\nmanagement is the Federal Reserve’s conduct of monetary policy. One of our key functions is to\nrespond to shocks—that is, to unexpected events—that may undermine the performance of the\nU.S. economy. And that’s one of the things I want to focus on today.\nWe certainly have had some major shocks in recent years. I’m not thinking only of the\ncurrent oil price shock, which is a serious issue and one I’ll go into later. I’m also thinking of\nseveral other shocks that have hit the economy over the last several years, and that, to some\nextent, are still reverberating.\nOne of those shocks has, for the most part, been very positive. It began back when I was\non the Board of Governors in Washington in the mid-1990s. I’m speaking, of course, of the\nphenomenal surge in productivity, which was largely associated with advances in technology and\ninvestments in the equipment embodying that technology. For the past nine years, productivity\nin the U.S. has grown at a pace of over three percent a year—three times as fast as the average\ngrowth rate during the 1970s, the 1980s, and the early 1990s. Faster productivity growth has had\nsome very positive effects on the economy. It has raised the economy’s potential to grow and\nthus the pace of expansion that the economy can sustain in the long run. Productivity growth is\nthe main driver of long-term trends in worker compensation. Faster productivity growth has\ntherefore allowed average living standards to advance much more rapidly than before. Faster\nproductivity growth enables firms to hold down costs. It thereby places downward pressure on\ninflation, helping us move toward price stability.\nBut faster productivity growth also had repercussions that created challenges for\nmonetary policy. In the second half of the 1990s, this extraordinary productivity surge—coupled\nwith the buildup to Y2K—led to a boom in investment that apparently went too far, collapsing\n2\n\ninto an investment bust by 2000. Faster productivity growth also likely contributed to the\nexcessive run-up and subsequent correction in stock prices. In 2001, of course, came the shock\nof the tragic events of 9/11, followed by the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. On the heels of that\ncame another shock—the corporate governance scandals. The result was serious erosion in\nconfidence and extreme caution in the business sector.\nIn response to these negative shocks, monetary policymakers responded aggressively,\nslashing short-term interest rates in 2001 to their lowest levels in forty years. The risk of\ndeflation prompted additional policy measures in 2003. The odds that the U.S. economy would\nslip into outright deflation were never very high. But the severity of the economic repercussions\nshould deflation take hold warranted an extraordinary monetary policy response. Befitting its\nrole as a “risk manager,” the Fed addressed this serious “downside risk” by taking out an\n“insurance policy”—lowering the federal funds rate to 1 percent and stating its belief that\nmonetary accommodation could likely be maintained for a “considerable period.”\nThe Fed’s actions helped to support consumer spending, particularly auto sales, and\nhousing. These sectors stayed strong despite the 2001 recession and the lackluster performance\nthat followed for the next year and a half. Two large tax cut packages in 2001 and 2003 coupled\nwith a pickup in spending for defense and homeland security also provided fiscal impetus. By\nearly 2004, the economy finally seemed to be on the road to a solid recovery: growth averaged a\nrobust five percent between the first quarter of 2003 and the first quarter of 2004. Firms\nrestructured their balance sheets. And the pace of investment spending picked up. The pace of\njob creation also increased: from March to May of this year, payroll employment rose at an\naverage of nearly 300,000 jobs per month.\n3\n\nUnfortunately, toward the end of the second quarter of 2004, the economy apparently\nstumbled. Growth for the whole quarter came in at only three and a quarter percent, dragged\ndown by especially sluggish growth in consumer spending. It is difficult to know exactly why\nconsumer spending slowed, but higher oil prices head the list of likely culprits. Higher oil prices\nare imposing a tax on households amounting to roughly $75 billion on an annual basis. The\ngood news is that we’ve seen an improvement in the growth of consumer spending since early\nsummer. In the third quarter, consumer spending on goods and services, including autos, appears\nto have rebounded from its sluggish performance in June. A partial glimpse at the third\nquarter’s overall growth performance suggests a pickup in the growth of real GDP to a rate\naround 4 percent. The bad news is that the labor market has yet to regain its footing completely,\ngenerating only 100,000 jobs a month from June through September. Job creation on that scale\nis below what is needed to reduce the slack that remains in labor markets.\nThis brings me to the outlook. While recent results for activity are somewhat\nencouraging, I wouldn’t say that we’re completely “out of the woods” just yet. Indeed, there are\nsome issues that have the potential to be troublesome going forward. As “risk managers” for the\nnation’s economy, I think monetary policymakers need to pay attention to these issues, so I’d\nlike to take a moment to touch on a few of them.\nThe first is oil. The price of oil rose from around $30 per barrel last summer to around\n$55 recently. Clearly, there’s pressure from the supply side, given the significant political\ninstability in major oil-producing regions like the Middle East, Venezuela, Russia, and Nigeria.\nIn addition, the world’s limited refining capacity is an issue, which certainly was not helped by\nthe recent hurricanes in the southeastern U.S. Along with this pressure from the supply side,\n4\n\nthese price hikes also are connected to very strong demand for oil—not only in the U.S. but also\nin emerging Asia, especially China—and that’s leading to a sharp increase in oil consumption.\nThe risk, of course, is that higher oil prices can put a further drag on spending and\nsimultaneously create inflationary pressure. In saying that, I don’t mean to conjure up the grim\ndays of the 1970s, when oil price shocks hit the economy very hard. Although oil prices are at\nall-time highs in nominal terms, they’re only about half of what they were thirty years ago on an\ninflation-adjusted basis. Moreover, in the course of those thirty years, the U.S. economy has also\nbecome much less dependent on oil. So the effect on today’s economy is nowhere near as huge\nas it was on the economy back then. But what adds to concerns about the higher oil prices is the\npossibility that they might continue, or even worsen, cutting further into people’s and firms’\nability to spend. Generally, when oil prices spike, the futures market expects them to retreat\nquickly. But recent developments suggest that the market sees a large portion of the recent oil\nshock as long-lasting, since the futures prices a year or so ahead have risen by almost as much as\nthe current price. If an oil price spike is perceived as transitory, households are more likely to\nmaintain existing spending patterns by lowering saving. Persistent oil price hikes, in contrast,\nseem likely to generate a larger and more persistent consumption response.\nHigher oil prices inevitably raise headline inflation for a time. The real risk, as we\nlearned during the 1970s, is that an uptick in inflation due to oil can become incorporated into\ninflationary expectations and built into subsequent wage and price setting. Such an outcome is\nunlikely if inflationary expectations are well-anchored. The evidence suggests that inflationary\nexpectations are well-anchored. We see this not only in a variety of surveys, but also in the\nmarkets, where there has been little change in the inflation compensation implicit in the spread\nbetween the yield on Treasury bonds and on Treasury inflation-indexed securities. That said, the\n5\n\nFederal Reserve cannot take the public’s trust in its commitment to price stability for granted. It\nmust remain vigilant and willing to act to insure price stability. As I said, oil markets represent\na risk, and one that will have more serious repercussions the longer oil prices stay high.\nBeyond the oil price shock, I think it’s worth looking at other developments that also can\nweigh on consumers and businesses and tend to make them rein in their spending. In terms of\nthe consumer, the sluggish job market could significantly restrain spending, as it lowers growth\nin disposable income and threatens to undermine consumer confidence. Another potential source\nof restraint going forward is the very low personal saving rate. As I’m sure you know,\nconsumers were a very important prop to the economy during the recession and the recovery. In\nfact, their resilience was pretty surprising. But to keep that up, they had to spend an ever\nincreasing fraction of their disposable incomes. Of course, at the same time, consumers have\nalso seen increases in wealth, especially their housing assets. It remains to be seen how long the\npattern of low savings will be maintained, especially if house prices were to increase more\ngradually or decline. Any noticeable attempt by households to improve their finances by cutting\nspending could seriously undermine the strength of the expansion.\nAnother area of risk—and one that may seem surprising—is business investment.\nAlthough it has been strong, it is probably less strong than one might expect, given the highly\nfavorable “fundamentals”—very high corporate profits and cash flow, the low real interest rates\nthat we’ve seen in recent years, and solidly growing demand. However, for the first time in\ndecades, business cash flow has actually exceeded total capital investment. This suggests a\ncontinuation of the caution that has marked business decisionmaking in the wake of the terrorist\nthreats and the issues surrounding corporate governance. This caution may also explain the\ninability of the labor market to establish sustained strength.\n6\n\nIf this cautious attitude were to continue, it could become especially troublesome next\nyear as the impetus to the economy from fiscal stimulus wanes. Most estimates suggest that,\nwhile the effects of the tax cuts and spending increases have been significantly positive for\neconomic growth last year and this year, they will turn to being roughly neutral by 2005. This\nmeans that the main impetus to growth will have to come from business investment and\nconsumption.\nFinally, there’s the issue of the trade gap. It has risen from near balance in the mid-1990s\nto a deficit of around $600 billion now, and it subtracted around a full percentage point from real\nGDP growth in the first half of this year. Traditionally, the U.S. economy has been considered a\nrelatively closed economy, so that developments in trade had only minor implications for our\neconomic growth. However, with the trade gap currently so large, uncertainty about its future\ncourse now poses significant issues for our real GDP growth. And its future course depends\nimportantly on the strength of domestic demand among our trading partners because that affects\ndemand for our exports. However, most of our major trading partners have had only sluggish\ngrowth in domestic demand recently, although their overall real GDP growth has been relatively\nhealthy. One economy with strong domestic demand has been China; but, even there, concerns\nabout overheating have led to efforts restrain its economy. So long as these conditions prevail\namong our trading partners, they will not provide much impetus for growth in our own economy.\nNow let me turn briefly to the inflation outlook. Higher oil prices, coupled with increases\nin both commodity and import prices pushed up overall inflation in the CPI to over a 4 percent\nrate in the first half of this year. Core inflation also rose at a somewhat elevated 2-1/2 percent in\nthe first half of this year. However, both indexes dropped back to more subdued rates in the third\nquarter—2 percent for the overall index and 1-1/2 percent for core inflation. As I noted earlier,\n7\n\nlonger-run inflationary expectations seem subdued.. So despite the uncertainties raised by oil\nprices, inflation---especially core consumer inflation---seems to be relatively well contained at\npresent. Moreover, there are some fundamental factors tending to push inflation down, including\nthe remaining slack in labor and product markets and continued rapid growth in productivity.\nNow let me try to pull all of these threads together and lay out what they imply from the\nperspective of monetary policy. At this point, policy, in my view, is still accommodative. The\nfederal funds rate is at one and three-quarters percent, and, with overall inflation a bit higher than\nthat over the past year, the “real” or inflation-adjusted federal funds rate is slightly below zero,\nwell below its historical average of around 2 ¾% over the last forty years. This suggests that\nshort-term interest rates eventually have to go up to prevent an increase in inflation. The policy\nchallenge is to consider two questions: “how far?” and “how fast?”\nTo begin to answer the question “how far,” economists compare the funds rate to a\nbenchmark called the long-run equilibrium or “neutral” real rate. This is the rate that would be\nconsistent with full employment of labor and capital resources and price stability over the long\nrun. I should emphasize that estimates of the long-run equilibrium rate are highly uncertain and\nmay change over time due to changes in productivity growth, the structural budget deficit, and\nother fundamentals. Analysts commonly compute the “neutral” real rate via computations with\neconometric models of the economy. Such models tend to put the mean “neutral” real rate in a\nrange of 2 to 3%, which is in the vicinity of its actual 40-year historical average. Of course, an\ninflation component must be added to obtain a neutral value for the nominal funds rate. With the\nreal federal funds rate currently near zero, such calculations suggest that the real funds rate\neventually will need to rise considerably above its current level for policy just to have a neutral\neffect on the economy.\n8\n\nIn making decisions in real time, however, policymakers also need to estimate an\nintermediate-term equilibrium real rate that would promote full employment over the next\nseveral years. I’ve spent some time today discussing a number of demand factors that have\ntended to restrain growth, or threaten to restrain growth in the future; in other words, these\nfactors may be holding the intermediate-term equilibrium real rate down. A first factor is the\nwaning of the stimulus from fiscal policy next year. A second factor may be the unusual\nbusiness caution that seems to be playing a role in sluggish job growth and investment spending\nthat is not as strong as would be expected based on the “fundamentals” commonly incorporated\ninto econometric models. While it’s difficult to pin down the exact nature and extent of this\ncaution, terrorism and uncertainty about corporate governance and the energy supply are\ncommonly cited by corporate executives.\nAnother factor that may be working in the same direction is the dollar, which has\nremained relatively high despite our large and growing trade deficit. A high dollar makes\nimports less expensive for us and makes our exports more expensive abroad, thereby\nundermining the demand for domestic output. In order to offset this drag on the demand for\ndomestically produced goods and services, interest rates must be lower than would otherwise be\nnecessary to produce full employment in our economy. A relatively high dollar depresses the\nequilibrium real rate.\nSo, for a number of reasons, the intermediate-run equilibrium real rate appears to be\nbelow its historic average and below model-based estimates of the long-term rate. I want to\nemphasize that there are probably even more uncertainties involved in estimating the\nintermediate-term equilibrium rate than there are in estimating the long-term rate. That’s why I\nwouldn’t be confident at all about giving you an actual estimate of the intermediate rate. But I\n9\n\ndo think it’s likely that the intermediate rate is below the long-term rate. This means that while\npolicy is stimulative, it’s not as stimulative as suggested by estimates of the long-term\nequilibrium rate.\nAt its last three meetings, the FOMC tightened policy slightly. The Committee indicated\nin its statement that, based upon what it then knew, removal of policy accommodation at a\n“measured pace” would most likely prove appropriate to promote a healthy outlook for the\neconomy—a moderate acceleration in growth with well-contained inflation. Of course, we must\nremain very watchful as developments unfold, and be prepared to consider modifications in our\ncourse of action as needed to ensure price stability and full employment. For example, there\nwould be a need to consider moving more aggressively if inflation showed signs of rising\nsignificantly. But as I said, core inflation appears to be well contained. Alternatively, there\nmight be a need to consider pausing in the process of raising rates if slower growth in demand\ncaused economic activity or labor market activity to slow down, perhaps for some of the reasons\nI’ve emphasized in my remarks today. By the same token, if inflation were to fall much further\nbelow recent rates, we would need to consider pausing.\nOverall, it seems clear that the federal funds rate will need to rise as we go forward, but\nthe pace of that increase will need to be closely linked to unfolding events. And I think it’s\nimportant that we keep the public well informed of our thinking on these issues.\nIndeed, an emphasis on communication and transparency has become a key feature of\ncurrent monetary policy. One reason for the focus on communication is that economic\ndevelopments are affected by longer-term interest rates, equity values, the exchange rate, and\nother asset values—and these factors depend not only on the current funds rate, but more\nimportantly on the expected future path of the funds rate. Clear, straightforward language that\n10\n\nhelps explain to markets and the public what the Fed is looking at, and why, can make policy\nmore effective by fostering the appropriate expectations and decisions. Moreover, it also can\nhelp policymakers avoid creating their own shocks, which can lead to disruptions in financial\nmarkets.\nI hope that my comments today have done their part to communicate clearly my thinking\nas a Fed policymaker. Now I’ll be glad to take any questions.\n# # #\n11",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n10:00 a.m. EST (4:00 p.m. local time)\nMarch 4, 2011\nImproving the International Monetary and Financial System\nRemarks by\nJanet L. Yellen\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nBanque de France International Symposium\nParis, France\nMarch 4, 2011\n\nNearly four decades have elapsed since the demise of Bretton Woods, and during\nthat time, the international monetary and financial system has undergone a significant\ntransformation. The changes that have occurred reflect deliberate policy choices by the\nofficial sector as well as the organic interactions of investors, institutions, and advancing\ntechnologies. Judging by the standards of global economic growth, stable prices, and\nfinancial stability, the international monetary and financial system, in its current\nincarnation, has a decidedly mixed record. Wrenching crises and economic distress,\nnotably including the difficult experience of the past several years, have punctuated\nperiods of solid growth, low inflation, and financial stability. Thus, the subject of today’s\ndiscussion is vitally important, and I am pleased to contribute my thoughts on steps we\ncan take to improve our international economic order.1\nIn evaluating our policy priorities, I find it helpful to distinguish between the\ninternational monetary system and the international financial system.2 The international\nmonetary system is the set of rules, conventions, and institutions associated with\nmonetary policy, official capital flows, and exchange rates. It also includes mechanisms\nto provide official sector support to countries facing funding pressures. The international\nfinancial system is much broader, encompassing both private and official participants in\nglobal financial markets. I consider this distinction important in thinking about how to\nreduce the incidence and severity of future crises while preserving a prosperous global\neconomy.\n1 These remarks solely reflect my own views and not necessarily those of any other member of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee. I appreciate the assistance of Trevor Reeve of the Board’s staff in the\npreparation of these remarks.\n2 For a further discussion of this distinction, see Edwin M. Truman (2010), “The International Monetary\nSystem and Global Imbalances” (Washington: Peterson Institute for International Economics, January),\nwww.iie.com/publications/papers/truman0110.pdf.\n\n- 2 -\nIn the case of the recent global financial crisis and recession, I would apportion\nresponsibility to inadequacies in both the monetary and financial systems. With respect\nto the international monetary system, the basic story is now quite familiar: Strong capital\noutflows from countries with chronic current account surpluses--in part reflecting heavily\nmanaged exchange rates, reserve accumulation, and other shortcomings in the operation\nof the international monetary system--put downward pressure on real interest rates, in\nturn boosting asset prices (particularly for housing) and enhancing the availability of\ncredit. These developments contributed significantly to the buildup of financial\nimbalances, but they were not, on their own, sufficient to have engendered the massive\nfinancial crisis we experienced.\nHad the additional domestic credit associated with these capital inflows been used\neffectively, the imbalances need not have led to financial ruin. In the United States and\nother countries with current account deficits, however, borrowing too often supported\nexcessive spending on housing and consumption, rather than financing productive\ninvestment. Most important, declines in underwriting standards, breakdowns in lending\noversight by investors and rating agencies, increased use of opaque financial products,\nand more-general inadequacies in risk management by private financial institutions\nhelped foster a dangerous and unsustainable credit boom. With the financial system\nevolving rapidly, supervisors and regulators, both in the United States and in many other\ncountries, failed to recognize and address the mounting vulnerabilities. In short, these\nfailures rooted in the financial system interacted with weaknesses in the global monetary\nsystem to create stresses and instabilities that eventually triggered--and amplified--the\nrecent financial crisis and subsequent recession.\n\n- 3 -\nOther economic crises can similarly be traced to the interaction of weaknesses in\nthe global monetary and financial systems. For example, the Asian financial crisis of the\nlate 1990s was rooted in failures to prudently allocate capital to productive investments--\nfailures of financial intermediation. But these problems were made worse by\ncharacteristics of the international monetary system, as heavily managed exchange rates\nencouraged excessive foreign currency borrowing. The collapse of the Thai baht in mid-\n1997, which marked the beginning of the crisis, resulted in substantial balance sheet\nlosses--particularly for that country’s banks--and triggered a widespread reappraisal of\nrisk in the entire region. As investors lost confidence, capital fled these economies,\nprecipitating a severe downturn. As in the recent experience of the United States, better\nmanagement of domestic financial systems in the emerging Asian economies would have\ngreatly limited, if not prevented, the financial vulnerabilities that ultimately resulted in\nthe crisis, but policies regarding exchange rate regimes and capital flows were also an\nimportant part of the story.\nThe conclusion I draw from these and other financial crises is that we must\nstrengthen both the financial system and the monetary system to create a more stable and\nless crisis-prone global economy. Improving the international financial system requires\nbetter management of national financial sectors and also enhanced international\ncooperation and coordination, because in a globalized economy with strong, complex,\ncross-border linkages, even domestic financial stresses can have serious international\nrepercussions.\nCountries need to work together to ensure that weaknesses in the global financial\nsystem are recognized and addressed. I am encouraged by the progress we have made in\n\n- 4 -\nstrengthening the banking sector through the capital and liquidity requirements of\nBasel III. We have also made important strides in improving international cooperation\nand coordination in the supervision of systemically important financial institutions,\nwhose operations and exposures span numerous jurisdictions. That said, we need to\ncontinue working toward viable resolution mechanisms for these institutions. Further\nwork is also needed to improve our macroprudential approach to managing\nvulnerabilities. And we must collaborate to ensure that risky activities do not migrate to\nthe shadows of the financial system in an attempt to circumvent regulatory authorities.\nWe must also strengthen the international monetary system. We need a system\ncharacterized by more open capital accounts, flexible exchange rates, and independent\nmonetary policies. Open capital accounts, supported by appropriate financial supervision\nand regulation, channel savings to their most productive uses, thereby enhancing welfare.\nExchange rate flexibility improves domestic macroeconomic management, allowing\ncountries to pursue independent monetary policies tailored to their individual needs, and\nlimits unwelcome spillovers to other economies. Such a system can also flexibly adapt to\nchanging economic and financial realities as countries develop, technology progresses,\nand shocks buffet the global economy.\nOur current international monetary system does not yet fulfill these objectives.\nWe now have a hybrid arrangement in which some economies have flexible exchange\nrates, maintain open capital accounts, and pursue independent monetary policy--a\nsensible reconciliation of the so-called impossible trinity. But other countries heavily\nmanage their exchange rates, with varying mixes of capital mobility and monetary policy\nindependence.\n\n- 5 -\nInflexible exchange rates in these countries have tended to inhibit adjustment of\nunsustainable global imbalances in trade and capital flows. Indeed, as I noted, such\nimbalances appear to have fostered the buildup of vulnerabilities in the run-up to the\nrecent financial crisis. Countries with current account surpluses and restricted capital\nflows have been able to resist currency appreciation for prolonged periods, even when\njustified by underlying fundamentals. In principle, adjustment of imbalances could occur\nif countries permitting relatively limited movements in nominal exchange rates allow\ntheir national price levels to adjust over time. But sterilization operations and other\npolicy tools can, and often have, restrained such adjustment. Meanwhile, countries with\ncurrent account deficits should take steps to increase national saving, including by putting\nin place credible plans to reduce their fiscal deficits in the longer run.\nThe international monetary system, in effect, still suffers from the same\nasymmetry that bedeviled the Bretton Woods system--namely, a marked differential in\nthe pressures facing surplus and deficit countries to permit automatic adjustments or to\nundertake policy to reduce persistent global imbalances. Surplus countries can resist\nadjustment by restricting capital flows and exchange rate movements, but deficit\ncountries are forced to adjust when they run out of international reserves or lose access to\nexternal borrowing. This asymmetry has served to inhibit the global rebalancing process,\nand it could threaten the ongoing recovery: If deficit countries curtail spending without\noffsetting spending increases in the surplus countries, aggregate demand would decline,\nwith adverse consequences for the global economy.\nThus, in my view, we need to continue working toward an international monetary\nsystem characterized by more-flexible exchange rates, open capital accounts, and\n\n- 6 -\nindependent monetary policies that will facilitate the adjustment of global imbalances.\nBut we must recognize that countries face diverse challenges in such a transition. For\ncountries with undervalued currencies, the adoption of more-flexible exchange rates\nrequires an internal shift in resources across sectors--a transition that takes time. As\nnoted earlier, the recent crisis has also uncovered numerous flaws in the functioning of\nregulation of our financial system, and these, too, will take time to correct. Finally,\nalthough I have not addressed this concern in my remarks today, the expansion of public-\nsector deficits and debts in many countries poses very serious medium- to long-run risks\nfor both the international monetary and financial systems that will need to be addressed.\nAgainst the background of these longer-term issues, we must also support\ncountries’ efforts to address their more immediate challenges. Some advanced\neconomies struggle with weak demand, high unemployment, and disinflation. Many\nemerging market economies face increasing inflationary pressures and capital inflows\namid strong growth. In light of these differing challenges, a cooperative spirit among\npolicymakers is essential to ensure prosperity of the global economy.",

The\nfinal rules implement sections 165(i)(1) and (i)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtection Act that require supervisory and company-run stress tests. Nonbank financial companies\ndesignated by the Financial Stability Oversight Council will also be subject to certain stress testing\nrequirements contained in the rules.\n\"Implementation of the Dodd-Frank stress test requirement is an important step in the Federal Reserve's\nefforts to promote the health of the financial sector,\" Governor Daniel K. Tarullo said. \"Stress testing is a\nkey tool to ensure that financial companies have enough capital to weather a severe economic downturn\nwithout posing a risk to their communities, other financial institutions, or to the general economy.\"\nThe Federal Reserve will begin conducting supervisory stress tests under the final rules this fall for the 19\nbank holding companies that participated in the 2009 Supervisory Capital Assessment Program and\nsubsequent Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Reviews. The final rules also require these companies\nand their state-member bank subsidiaries to conduct their own Dodd-Frank company-run stress tests this\nfall, with the results to be publicly disclosed in March 2013.\nIn general, other companies subject to the Board's final rules for Dodd-Frank stress testing will be\nrequired to comply with the final rule beginning in October 2013. Companies with between $10 billion and\n$50 billion in total assets that begin conducting their first company-run stress test in in the fall of 2013 will\nnot have to publicly disclose the results of that first stress test.\nThe Board's two final rules revise portions of the Federal Reserve's notice of proposed rulemaking to\nimplement the enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements established under the\nDodd-Frank Act. The Board coordinated closely with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation to ensure that final stress testing rules issued by the agencies are\nconsistent and comparable. The Board also coordinated with the Federal Insurance Office as required by\nthe Dodd-Frank Act.\nThe Federal Reserve will release the scenarios for this year's supervisory and company-run stress tests\nno later than November 15, 2012. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the scenarios will describe\nhypothetical baseline, adverse, and severely adverse conditions, with paths for key macroeconomic and\nfinancial variables. To help firms prepare to estimate their losses and revenues under the scenarios, the\nFederal Reserve on Tuesday released historical data for variables likely to be used in the scenarios. A\nrevised version of these historical data, reflecting the latest information, will be published along with the\nscenarios.\n\nAdditional Information\nAll circulars and documents are available on the Internet through the Federal Reserve Bank of San\nFrancisco’s website, at http://www.frbsf.org/banking/letters.\nFor additional information, please contact:\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nBanking Supervision and Regulation\nLarge Bank Organizations\n(415) 974-3206\nAttachment: Annual Company-Run Stress Test Requirements - Final Rule\nSupervisory and Company-Run Stress Test Requirements - Final Rule\nHistorical Data",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n9:50 PM EDT\nJune 2, 2013\nRegulatory Landscapes: A U.S. Perspective\nRemarks by Janet L. Yellen\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nInternational Monetary Conference\nShanghai, China\nJune 3, 2013\n\nThank you. I don’t want to delay what I expect to be a lively discussion, so my\nopening remarks will be brief. I’ll summarize the considerable progress since 2008 to make\nthe global financial system more resilient, and then offer my views on what more should be\ndone.\nA Brief Retrospective on Financial Regulatory Progress\nIt’s useful to divide the regulatory reform work of the past few years into three\ncategories: strengthening the basic bank regulatory framework, reducing the threat to financial\nstability posed by systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs), and strengthening core\nfinancial markets and infrastructure.\nBank Regulatory Basics\nThe financial crisis revealed that banking firms around the world did not have enough\nhigh-quality capital to absorb losses during periods of severe stress. The Basel III reforms\npromulgated in 2010 by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision will increase the amount\nof regulatory capital required to be held by global banking firms and improve the loss-absorbing\nquality of that capital. U.S. banking agencies issued proposals last summer to implement\nBasel III’s capital reforms, have reviewed comments, and are preparing the final regulation.\nWe also were reminded during the crisis that a banking firm--particularly one with\nsignificant amounts of short-term wholesale funding--can become illiquid before it becomes\ninsolvent, as creditors run in the face of uncertainty about the firm’s viability. The Basel\nCommittee generated two liquidity standards to mitigate these risks: a Liquidity Coverage Ratio\nwith a 30-day time horizon and a Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) with a one-year time\nhorizon. The U.S. banking agencies expect to issue a proposal to implement the Liquidity\n\n- 2 -\nCoverage Ratio later this year, and we are working with the Basel Committee now to review the\nstructure and parameters of the NSFR.\nSpecial Measures for SIFIs\nThe financial crisis also made clear that international bank rules should focus more on the\npotential threat to financial stability posed by SIFIs. In this arena, the efforts of the Federal\nReserve and the global regulatory community have focused principally on (1) producing stronger\nregulations to reduce the probability of default of such firms to levels that are meaningfully\nbelow those for less systemically important financial firms, and (2) creating a resolution regime\nto reduce the losses to the broader financial system and economy upon the failure of a SIFI. The\ngoal has been to compel SIFIs to internalize the costs their failure would impose on society and\nto offset any implicit subsidy that such firms may enjoy due to market perceptions that they are\ntoo-big-to-fail.\nThe effort to reduce the likelihood of SIFI failure has worked through several channels.\nThe Basel Committee in 2011 agreed on a framework of graduated common equity risk-based\ncapital surcharges for systemic firms, and we are working toward proposing rules to implement\nthis surcharge framework in the United States. Consistent with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection Act, the Federal Reserve proposed a broad set of enhanced\nprudential standards for large U.S. bank holding companies in December 2011. The Federal\nReserve also now performs rigorous annual supervisory stress tests and capital plan reviews of the\nlargest banking firms to ensure that these firms can continue to operate and lend through times of\nsevere economic and financial stress.\nIn addition, in December the Federal Reserve proposed enhanced prudential standards\nfor foreign banks under the Dodd-Frank Act. The proposal generally would require foreign\n\n- 3 -\nbanks with a large U.S. presence to organize their U.S. subsidiaries under a single intermediate\nholding company that would be subject to the same capital and liquidity requirements as U.S.\nbank holding companies. The proposal is designed to increase the resiliency and resolvability of\nthe U.S. operations of foreign banks, help protect U.S. and global financial stability, and\npromote competitive equity for all large banking firms operating in the United States.\nIn addition to reducing the probability of SIFI failure, global regulators also have striven\nto reduce the potential damage to the financial system and the economy if a failure of a major\nfinancial firm were to occur. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) has proposed new standards\nfor statutory resolution frameworks, firm-specific resolution planning, and cross-border\ncooperation. In the United States, Dodd-Frank created an Orderly Liquidation Authority and\nrequired all large bank holding companies to develop resolution plans. Other countries that are\nhome to large global banking firms are working along similar lines.\nStrengthening Resilience of Financial Markets\nReducing the likelihood of a severe financial crisis also requires strengthening the\ncapacity of our financial markets and infrastructure to absorb shocks. Toward that end, U.S. and\nglobal regulators have worked to improve the transparency and stability of the over-the-counter\nderivatives markets and to strengthen the oversight of financial market utilities and other critical\nfinancial infrastructure. In particular, U.S. agencies are working together to address structural\nweaknesses in the triparty repo market and in money market mutual funds.\nThe Unfinished Business of Financial Regulatory Reform\nLet me now look forward. Although we have made the financial system safer, important\nwork remains in each of the three areas I have highlighted: the basic bank regulatory apparatus,\naddressing the problems posed by SIFIs, and limiting risks in shadow banking and financial\nmarkets. Let me outline what I consider the principal pieces of unfinished business in global\n\n- 4 -\nfinancial regulatory reform.\nStrengthening the Basic Bank Regulatory Framework\nFirst, we must actively support the continuing efforts of the Basel Committee to\nstrengthen the foundations of global bank regulation. Key Basel Committee work in the years\nahead will include finalizing the Basel III leverage ratio and NSFR, completing the\ncomprehensive review of trading book capital requirements, adopting a global large-exposure\nregime, and increasing the comparability of risk-based capital requirements across banks and\nacross countries. I want to highlight the importance of the committee’s work to explore ways to\nincrease the standardization and comparability of the risk-based capital rules for global banks.\nThe stability of the global financial system depends critically on the capital adequacy of global\nbanks, the capital adequacy of global banks depends critically on the Basel III reforms, and much\nof the good progress in the Basel III reforms rests on the integrity and strength of the risk\nweights.\nReducing the Probability of SIFI Failure\nAs this brief history has highlighted, tougher prudential regulation and supervision have\nsubstantially reduced the probability of a SIFI failure. Ending too-big-to-fail will require\nsteadfast implementation by global regulators over the next few years of the work already in\ntrain. Some have proposed ideas for more sweeping restructuring of the banking system to solve\ntoo-big-to-fail. These ideas include resurrection of Glass-Steagall-style separation of\ncommercial banking from investment banking and imposition of bank size limits. I am not\npersuaded that such blunt approaches would be the most efficient ways to address the too-big-to-\nfail problem. But at the same time I’m not convinced that the existing SIFI regulatory work\nplan, which moves in the right direction, goes far enough. As my colleagues Governors Tarullo\n\n- 5 -\nand Stein have noted in recent speeches, it may be appropriate to go beyond the capital\nsurcharges put forward by the Basel Committee. As they suggest, fully offsetting any remaining\ntoo-big-to-fail subsidies and forcing full internalization of the social costs of a SIFI failure may\nrequire either a steeper capital surcharge curve or some other mechanism for requiring that\nadditional capital be held by firms that potentially pose the greatest risks to financial stability.\nImproving SIFI Resolvability\nThere are at least three key obstacles that policymakers must overcome to maximize the\nprospects for an orderly resolution of a global financial firm. First, each major jurisdiction must\nadopt a statutory resolution regime for financial firms consistent with the FSB’s Key Attributes.1\nThe United States has been a leader in this regard, and I hope that other countries that have not\nyet adopted a compliant resolution regime will do so promptly. Second, policymakers need to\nensure that all SIFIs maintain a sufficient amount of total pre-failure and post-failure loss\nabsorption capacity. In consultation with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal\nReserve is considering the merits of a regulatory requirement that the largest, most complex U.S.\nbanking firms maintain a minimum amount of long-term unsecured debt outstanding. Such a\nrequirement could enhance the prospects for an orderly SIFI resolution. Switzerland, the United\nKingdom, and the European Union are moving forward on similar requirements, and it may be\nuseful to work toward an international agreement on minimum total loss absorbency\nrequirements for global SIFIs. Third, it is time for policymakers to find concrete and credible\nsolutions to the thorny cross-border obstacles that impede the orderly resolution of a globally\nsystemic financial firm.\n1 Financial Stability Board (2011), Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions\n(Washington, D.C.: Financial Stability Board, October),\nwww.financialstabilityboard.org/publications/r_111104cc.pdf.\n\n- 6 -\nReducing Systemic Risk in the Shadow Banking System\nImportant as banking reforms may be, it is worth recalling that the trigger for the acute\nphase of the financial crisis was the rapid unwinding of large amounts of short-term wholesale\nfunding that had been made available to highly leveraged and/or maturity-transforming\nfinancial firms that were not subject to consolidated prudential supervision.\nMany of the key problems related to shadow banking and their potential solutions are\nstill being debated domestically and internationally. But I believe the path forward is\nreasonably clear. We need to increase the transparency of shadow banking markets so that\nauthorities can monitor for signs of excessive leverage and unstable maturity transformation\noutside regulated banks. We also need to take further steps to reduce the risk of runs on money\nmarket mutual funds. In addition, we need to further ameliorate risks in the settlement process\nfor triparty repo agreements, including through continued reductions in the amount of intraday\ncredit provided by the clearing banks.\nBut even when we accomplish these reforms, more work will remain to reduce systemic\nrisk in the short-term wholesale funding markets that shadow banking relies on. A major\nsource of unaddressed risk emanates from the large volume of short-term securities financing\ntransactions (SFTs)--repos, reverse repos, securities borrowing and lending transactions, and\nmargin loans--engaged in by broker-dealers, money market funds, hedge funds, and other\nshadow banks. Regulatory reform mostly passed over these transactions, I suspect, because\nSFTs appear safe from a microprudential perspective. But SFTs, particularly large matched\nbooks of SFTs, create sizable macroprudential risks, including large negative externalities from\ndealer defaults and from asset fire sales. The existing bank and broker-dealer regulatory\nregimes have not been designed to materially mitigate these systemic risks. The global\nregulatory community should focus significant amounts of energy, now, to attack this problem.\n\n- 7 -\nThe perfect solution may not yet be clear but possible options are evident: raising bank and\nbroker-dealer capital or liquidity requirements on SFTs, or imposing minimum margin\nrequirements on some or all SFTs.\nI’ll stop there, and I look forward to the discussion.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n7:30 p.m. EDT\nOctober 20, 2017\nA Challenging Decade and a Question for the Future\nRemarks by\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n2017 Herbert Stein Memorial Lecture\nNational Economists Club\nWashington, D.C.\nOctober 20, 2017\n\nI am delighted to address the National Economists Club, and I am also honored on\nthis occasion to be associated with Herb Stein, whose public service and\nscholarship--characterized by careful analysis, clear-eyed pragmatism, and sharp wit--\nexemplified the best in our profession. Herb was willing to consider new ideas and new\napproaches to government policy, and that openness fits with the subject of my remarks\ntoday. Namely, I will discuss the unconventional monetary policy tools used by the\nFederal Reserve since the start of the financial crisis and Great Recession and the role\nthat those tools may play in addressing future economic challenges.\nNearly 10 years ago, with our nation mired in its worst economic and financial\ncrisis since the Great Depression, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nconfronted a key challenge to the pursuit of its congressionally mandated goals of\nmaximum employment and price stability: how to support a weakening U.S. economy\nonce our main conventional policy tool, the federal funds rate, had been lowered to\nessentially zero. Addressing that problem eventually led to a second challenge: how to\nensure that we could scale back monetary policy accommodation in an orderly fashion\nonce it was no longer needed. Failure to meet either challenge would have significantly\ncompromised our ability to foster maximum employment and price stability, leading to\nserious consequences for the livelihoods of millions of Americans.\nI will argue today that we have met the first challenge and have made good\nprogress to date in meeting the second. Thanks in part to the monetary policy\naccommodation provided in the aftermath of the crisis--especially through enhanced\nforward rate guidance and large-scale asset purchases--the U.S. economy has made great\nstrides. Indeed, with the economy now operating near maximum employment and\n\n- 2 -\ninflation expected to rise to the FOMC’s 2 percent objective over the next couple of\nyears, the FOMC has been scaling back the accommodation provided in response to the\nGreat Recession. In no small part because of our authority to pay interest on excess\nreserves, the process of removing policy accommodation is working well.\nAfter discussing a few issues related to our recent decision to start reducing the\nsize of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, I will address a key question: What is the\nappropriate future role of the unconventional policy tools that we deployed to address the\nGreat Recession? While I believe that influencing short-term interest rates should\ncontinue to be our primary monetary policy lever in normal times, our unconventional\npolicy tools will likely be needed again should some future economic downturn drive\nshort-term interest rates back to their effective lower bound. Indeed, empirical analysis\nsuggests that the neutral federal funds rate--defined as the level of the federal funds rate\nthat is neither expansionary nor contractionary when the economy is operating near its\npotential--is much lower than in previous decades. Consequently, the probability that\nshort-term interest rates may need to be reduced to their effective lower bound at some\npoint is uncomfortably high, even in the absence of a major financial and economic crisis.\nI will return to the question about the future of our various policy tools, but first I\nwould like to review our experience this decade, which I view as instructive for\naddressing that question.\nMeeting the Challenge of Providing Additional Accommodation\nA substantial body of evidence suggests that the U.S. economy is much stronger\ntoday than it would have been without the unconventional monetary policy tools\ndeployed by the Federal Reserve in response to the Great Recession. Two key tools were\n\n- 3 -\nlarge-scale asset purchases and forward guidance about our intentions for the future path\nof short-term interest rates. The rationale for those tools was straightforward: Given our\ninability to meaningfully lower short-term interest rates after they reached near-zero in\nlate 2008, the FOMC used increasingly explicit forward rate guidance and asset\npurchases to apply downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, which were still well\nabove zero.\nLonger-term interest rates reflect, in part, financial market participants’\nexpectations of the future path of short-term interest rates. As a result, FOMC\ncommunications that affect those expectations--such as the enhanced forward rate\nguidance provided in our post-meeting statements in the aftermath of the Great\nRecession--can affect longer-term interest rates.1 In addition, longer-term interest rates\ninclude a term premium, which is the compensation demanded by investors for bearing\nthe interest rate risk associated with longer-term securities. When the Federal Reserve\nbuys longer-term securities in the open market, the remaining stock of securities available\nfor purchase by the public declines, which pushes the prices of those securities up and\nthus depresses their yields by lowering the term premiums embedded in those yields.2\nSeveral studies have found that our forward rate guidance and asset purchases did\nappreciably reduce longer-term interest rates.3\n1 Before the Great Recession, the FOMC occasionally provided forward rate guidance, but that guidance\nwas typically confined to a relatively short horizon.\n2 In addition to depressing term premiums, large-scale asset purchases by the Federal Reserve can lower\nlonger-term yields if those purchases are perceived by the public as a signal that short-term interest rates\nare likely to remain lower for longer than previously anticipated.\n3 See, for instance, Eric T. Swanson and John C. Williams (2014), “Measuring the Effect of the Zero Lower\nBound on Medium- and Longer-Term Interest Rates,” American Economic Review, vol. 104 (October),\npp. 3154-85; Joseph Gagnon, Matthew Raskin, Julie Remache, and Brian Sack (2011), “The Financial\nMarket Effects of the Federal Reserve’s Large-Scale Asset Purchases,” International Journal of Central\nBanking, vol. 7 (March), pp. 3-43, www.ijcb.org/journal/ijcb11q1a1.pdf; and Stefania D’Amico, William\n\n- 4 -\nThe FOMC’s goal in lowering longer-term interest rates was to help the U.S.\neconomy recover from the recession and stem the disinflationary forces that emerged\nfrom it. Some have suggested that the slow pace of the economic recovery proves that\nour unconventional policy tools were ineffective. However, one should recognize that\nthe recovery could have been much slower in the absence of our unconventional tools.\nIndeed, the evidence strongly suggests that forward rate guidance and securities\npurchases--by substantially lowering borrowing costs for millions of American families\nand businesses and making overall financial conditions more accommodative--did help\nspur consumption and business spending, lower the unemployment rate, and stave off\ndisinflationary pressures.4\nOther central banks also deployed unconventional policy tools in the years that\nfollowed the financial crisis.5 Evidence accumulated from their experience also supports\nthe notion that these tools have helped stimulate economic activity in their countries after\ntheir short-term interest rates were lowered to near-zero--and, in some cases, even below\nzero.6\nEnglish, David Lopez-Salido, and Edward Nelson (2012), “The Federal Reserve’s Large-Scale Asset\nPurchase Programmes: Rationale and Effects,” Economic Journal, vol. 122 (November), pp. F415-46.\n4 See, for instance, Eric M. Engen, Thomas Laubach, and David Reifschneider (2015), “The\nMacroeconomic Effects of the Federal Reserve’s Unconventional Monetary Policies,” Finance and\nEconomics Discussion Series 2015-005 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,\nJanuary), http://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2015.005.\n5 The Bank of Japan had deployed unconventional tools well before the crisis.\n6 See, for instance, Andrew G. Haldane, Matt Roberts-Sklar, Tomasz Wieladek, and Chris Young (2016),\n“QE: The Story So Far,” Staff Working Paper No. 624 (London: Bank of England, October),\nwww.bankofengland.co.uk/research/Documents/workingpapers/2016/swp624.pdf; and Luca Gambetti and\nAlberto Musso (2017), “The Macroeconomic Impact of the ECB’s Expanded Asset Purchase Programme\n(APP),” ECB Working Paper 2075 (Frankfurt: European Central Bank, June),\nwww.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp.2075.en.pdf.\n.\n\n- 5 -\nMeeting the Challenge of Scaling Back Accommodation\nBy 2014, the U.S. economy was making notable progress toward the FOMC’s\ngoals of maximum employment and price stability. The unemployment rate had dropped\nto 6 percent by midyear--well below its Great Recession peak of 10 percent--and other\nmeasures of labor market conditions were also showing significant improvement. In\naddition, inflation, as measured by the change in the price index for personal\nconsumption expenditures, had reached about 1-3/4 percent by mid-2014 after hovering\naround 1 percent in the fall of 2013. Reflecting that progress, the Federal Reserve’s\nfocus was shifting from providing additional monetary policy accommodation to scaling\nit back.7 A key question for the FOMC then was how to reduce the degree of\naccommodation in the context of a vastly expanded Federal Reserve balance sheet.\nOne possible approach was to start by reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities\nholdings while short-term interest rates remained at the lower bound. We could allow\nsecurities to roll off the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and even sell securities, thereby\nputting upward pressure on long-term rates while calibrating the pace and configuration\nof the reduction in our holdings as warranted by our maximum employment and price\nstability objectives. Eventually, once our securities holdings had shrunk sufficiently, the\nFOMC could start nudging up its short-term interest rate target.\nOne problem of this “last in, first out” approach was that the FOMC does not have\nany experience in calibrating the pace and composition of asset redemptions and sales to\nactual and prospective economic conditions. Indeed, as the so-called taper tantrum of\n7 See Janet L. Yellen (2017), “From Adding Accommodation to Scaling It Back,” speech delivered at the\nExecutives’ Club of Chicago, Chicago, Ill., March 3,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20170303a.htm.\n\n- 6 -\n2013 illustrated, even talk of prospective changes in our securities holdings can elicit\nunexpected abrupt changes in financial conditions.\nGiven the lack of experience with reducing our asset holdings to scale back\nmonetary policy accommodation and the need to carefully calibrate the removal of\naccommodation, the FOMC opted to allow changes in the Federal Reserve’s securities\nholdings to play a secondary role in the Committee’s normalization strategy. Rather than\nbalance sheet shrinkage, the FOMC decided that its primary tool for scaling back\nmonetary policy accommodation would be influencing short-term interest rates.\nAs we explained in our “normalization principles” issued in September 2014, the\nFOMC decided to maintain the overall size of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings at\nan elevated level until sometime after the FOMC had begun to raise short-term interest\nrates.8 Once normalization of the level of the federal funds rate was “well under way”\nand the Committee judged that the economic expansion was strong enough that further\nincreases in short-term interest rates were likely to be warranted, the FOMC would\ngradually and predictably reduce the size of the balance sheet by allowing the Federal\nReserve’s securities holdings to “run off”--that is, we would allow our balance sheet to\nshrink passively by not reinvesting all of the principal payments from our securities.9\n8 Information on the FOMC’s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans is available on the Board’s\nwebsite at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/policy-normalization.htm.\n9 The FOMC announced in December 2015 that it anticipated maintaining its reinvestment policy until\nnormalization of the level of the federal funds rate was “well under way.” That announcement is available\non the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20151216a1.pdf.\nMore recently, in June 2017, the FOMC provided additional details regarding its approach to reduce the\nFederal Reserve’s securities holdings, indicating that once the balance sheet normalization plan began,\nprincipal payments received from securities held by the Federal Reserve would be reinvested only to the\nextent that those payments exceeded certain monthly caps. The caps would rise gradually but would\nremain in place during the normalization process. The June 2017 announcement, Addendum to the Policy\nNormalization Principles and Plans, is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_PolicyNormalization.20170613.pdf.\n\n- 7 -\nOne advantage of the FOMC’s chosen approach to scaling back accommodation\nis that both the FOMC and the public have decades of experience with adjustments in\nshort-term interest rates in response to changes in economic conditions. Nonetheless, the\npost-crisis environment presented a new test to the FOMC’s ability to influence short-\nterm interest rates.\nBefore the crisis, the FOMC could raise the federal funds rate--the rate at which\nbanks with excess reserves lend to banks with a reserve need--by removing a small\namount of reserves from the banking system. That would translate into a higher federal\nfunds rate because reserves were relatively scarce to begin with. The intuition was\nsimple: The FOMC would signal that it was going to tighten conditions in the reserve\nmarket, and the cost of obtaining reserves in the market--the federal funds rate--would\nrise. Other market interest rates would then increase accordingly.\nAfter the crisis, however, reserves were plentiful because the Federal Reserve\nfunded its large-scale asset purchases through adding reserves to the system--crediting\nthe bank accounts of those who were selling assets to the Fed. Moreover, in light of the\nFOMC’s decision not to sell the longer-term securities it acquired, reserves were likely to\nremain plentiful for the foreseeable future. Consequently, when the time came to remove\naccommodation, a key question for the Committee was how to raise the federal funds rate\nin an environment of abundant reserves.10 An important part of the answer to that\nquestion came in the Federal Reserve’s authority to pay interest on excess reserves. The\n10 For a discussion of the pre- and post-crisis frameworks for implementing short-term interest rate\ndecisions, see Jane E. Ihrig, Ellen E. Meade, and Gretchen C. Weinbach (2015), “Rewriting Monetary\nPolicy 101: What’s the Fed’s Preferred Post-Crisis Approach to Raising Interest Rates?” Journal of\nEconomic Perspectives, vol. 29 (Fall), pp. 177-98,\nhttp://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.29.4.177.\n\n- 8 -\nCongress granted the Federal Reserve that authority in 2006, to become effective in 2011.\nHowever, in the fall of 2008, the Congress moved up the effective date to October 2008.\nHaving authority to pay interest on excess reserves means that the Federal\nReserve can influence the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates regardless\nof the amount of excess reserves in the banking system. The mechanics of the new\nframework are straightforward: Banks will generally only provide short-term funding at\nan interest rate around or above what they could earn at the Fed. As a result, if the\nFederal Reserve raised the rate it paid, other short-term lending rates would likely rise as\nwell.11 This new approach for raising short-term interest rates is working well: Since\nDecember 2015, we have raised the interest paid on excess reserves and the target range\nfor the federal funds rate by 100 basis points, and the effective federal funds rate has\nrisen accordingly.12\nA Closer Look at Our Balance Sheet Strategy\nIn light of our recent decision to start reducing our securities holdings this month,\nI would like to discuss a few aspects of our balance sheet strategy.13 The FOMC\nanticipated that its decision to maintain the size of the Federal Reserve’s securities\n11 The Federal Reserve created supplementary tools to be used as needed to help strengthen its influence\nover short-term interest rates when reserves are plentiful. For instance, the overnight reverse repurchase\nagreement facility allows a variety of counterparties, including eligible money market funds, government-\nsponsored enterprises, broker-dealers, and depository institutions to invest funds overnight with the Federal\nReserve at a rate determined by the FOMC.\n12 For a discussion of how increases in the FOMC’s target range for the federal funds rate have transmitted\nto other short-term interest rates, see Alyssa Anderson, Jane Ihrig, Mary-Frances Styczynski, and Gretchen\nC. Weinbach (2017), “How Have the Fed’s Three Rate Hikes Passed through to Selected Short-Term\nInterest Rates?” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, June 2),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/how-have-the-feds-three-rate-hikes-passed-\nthrough-to-selected-short-term-interest-rates-20170602.htm.\n13 The FOMC’s announcement of the beginning of implementation of the balance sheet normalization plan\nis available on the Board’s website; see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2017),\n“Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,” press release, September 20,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20170920a1.pdf.\n\n- 9 -\nholdings at an elevated level until sometime after the beginning of rate hikes would keep\nsome downward pressure on longer-term interest rates well after the end of its asset\npurchase programs. Although estimates of the effect of our securities holdings on longer-\nterm interest rates are subject to uncertainty, a recent study reported that the Federal\nReserve’s securities holdings were reducing the term premium on the 10-year Treasury\nyield by roughly 1 percentage point at the end of 2016.14\nThe guidance that the FOMC would eventually start a gradual and predictable\nreduction of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings implied that the downward\npressure on longer-term yields would likely diminish over time as financial market\nparticipants came to expect that the start of balance sheet normalization was nearing.\nIndeed, with that process now under way, it is likely that our securities holdings are now\ndepressing the term premium on the 10-year yield by somewhat less than the\n1 percentage point estimate reported for late last year.\nSeveral factors suggest that the downward pressure on term premiums exerted by\nour securities holdings is likely to diminish only gradually as our holdings shrink. For\ninstance, as I have already noted, our intention to reduce our balance sheet by reducing\nreinvestment of repayments of principal on our holdings--rather than selling assets--has\nbeen well communicated for several years now. As a result, we do not anticipate a jump\nin term premiums as our balance sheet reduction plan gets under way. In addition, the\n14 See Brian Bonis, Jane Ihrig, and Min Wei (2017), “Projected Evolution of the SOMA Portfolio and the\n10-Year Treasury Term Premium Effect,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System, September 22), https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.2081.\n\n- 10 -\nmaturity distribution of our securities holdings is such that it will take some years for the\nsize of our holdings to normalize via runoff.15\nThe judgment that the downward pressure on term premiums will decline only\ngradually as we reduce the size of our balance sheet stands in sharp contrast to evidence\nsuggesting that this pressure built up rather quickly when we were expanding our balance\nsheet. To understand this contrast, remember that, unlike our plan to shrink our balance\nsheet, the various phases of our asset purchases had, to differing degrees, an element of\nsurprise, with asset purchase announcements occasionally leaving a distinct imprint on\nthe path of longer-term yields. Moreover, each of our asset purchase programs resulted\nin a rapid increase in our securities holdings during a relatively short period, whereas the\nnormalization process will play out gradually over many years.\nI have focused thus far on the likely response of term premiums to our balance\nsheet reduction plan. Let me turn my attention briefly to the likely response of longer-\nterm yields, which, as I have noted, reflect both a term premium component and\nexpectations of the future path of short-term interest rates. While the available evidence\npoints to a strong reaction of longer-term yields to our asset purchases, it is conceivable\nthat those yields will react much more modestly to our balance sheet reduction plan.\nConsider, for instance, a hypothetical scenario in which the FOMC has decided\nnot to rely on balance sheet reduction to scale back accommodation, choosing instead to\ncontinue to reinvest indefinitely all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s\n15 Moreover, as the FOMC announced in June, the Committee decided to cap the monthly run-off in the\nFederal Reserve’s securities holdings, making the balance sheet normalization process even more\npredictable and gradual. The FOMC’s announcement is available on the Board’s website; see Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System (2017), “FOMC Issues Addendum to the Policy Normalization\nPrinciples and Plans,” press release, June 14,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20170614c.htm.\n\n- 11 -\nsecurities holdings. If financial market participants perceived no change in the economic\noutlook and no intention on the part of the FOMC to alter the overall stance of monetary\npolicy, the FOMC’s inclination to leave the size of the balance sheet unchanged would be\ntaken as an indication that the FOMC would instead rely more on increases in short-term\ninterest rates to scale back accommodation, resulting in a faster pace of short-term\ninterest hikes. On net, longer-term yields may be little affected by this hypothetical\nscenario: While the decreased emphasis on balance sheet reduction would depress term\npremiums and hold longer-term yields lower, the expected faster pace of short-term\ninterest rate increases would push longer-term yields higher.16\nA Key Question for the Future\nAs the financial crisis and Great Recession fade into the past and the stance of\nmonetary policy gradually returns to normal, a natural question concerns the possible\nfuture role of the unconventional policy tools we deployed after the onset of the crisis.\nMy colleagues on the FOMC and I believe that, whenever possible, influencing short-\nterm interest rates by targeting the federal funds rate should be our primary tool. As I\nhave already noted, we have a long track record using this tool to pursue our statutory\ngoals. In contrast, we have much more limited experience with using our securities\nholdings for that purpose.\nWhere does this assessment leave our unconventional policy tools? I believe their\ndeployment should be considered again if our conventional tool reaches its limit--that is,\n16 In contrast, when the Federal Reserve was purchasing assets, short-term interest rates were at their\neffective lower bound, and they were expected to remain there for the foreseeable future. As a result,\ndecisions to buy additional assets--and the resulting additional downward pressure on term premiums--were\nnot offset by expectations of a higher path for short-term interest rates. The end result was that there was\ngreater potential for asset purchases to have a discernible effect on longer-term yields in the years\nimmediately following the financial crisis than in current circumstances.\n\n- 12 -\nwhen the federal funds rate has reached its effective lower bound and the U.S. economy\nstill needs further monetary policy accommodation.\nDoes this mean that it will take another Great Recession for our unconventional\ntools to be used again? Not necessarily. Recent studies suggest that the neutral level of\nthe federal funds rate appears to be much lower than it was in previous decades.17\nIndeed, most FOMC participants now assess the longer-run value of the neutral federal\nfunds rate as only 2-3/4 percent or so, compared with around 4-1/4 percent just a few\nyears ago.18 With a low neutral federal funds rate, there will typically be less scope for\nthe FOMC to reduce short-term interest rates in response to an economic downturn,\nraising the possibility that we may need to resort again to enhanced forward rate guidance\nand asset purchases to provide needed accommodation.19\nOf course, substantial uncertainty surrounds any estimates of the neutral level of\nshort-term interest rates. In this regard, there is an important asymmetry to consider. If\nthe neutral rate turns out to be significantly higher than we currently estimate, it is less\n17 See, for instance, James D.

In contrast, if the\nneutral rate is as low as we estimate or even lower, we will be glad to have our\nunconventional tools in our toolkit.\nThe bottom line is that we must recognize that our unconventional tools might\nhave to be used again. If we are indeed living in a low-neutral-rate world, a significantly\nless severe economic downturn than the Great Recession might be sufficient to drive\nshort-term interest rates back to their effective lower bound.\nConclusion\nLet me conclude with a brief summary. As a result of the Great Recession, the\nFederal Reserve has confronted two key challenges over the past several years: One, the\nFOMC had to provide additional policy accommodation after short-term interest rates\nreached their effective lower bound; and two, subsequently, as we made progress toward\nthe achievement of our mandate, we had to start scaling back that accommodation in the\npresence of a vastly expanded Federal Reserve balance sheet.\nToday I highlighted two points about the FOMC’s experience with those\nchallenges. First, the monetary policy tools that the Federal Reserve deployed in the\nimmediate aftermath of the crisis--explicit forward rate guidance, large-scale asset\npurchases, and the payment of interest on excess reserves--have helped us overcome\nthese challenges.\nSecond, in light of evidence suggesting that the neutral level of short-term interest\nrates is significantly lower than it was in previous decades, the likelihood that future\nmonetary policymakers will have to confront those two challenges again is\nuncomfortably high. For this reason, we must keep our unconventional policy tools\n\n- 14 -\nready to be deployed again should short-term interest rates return to their effective lower\nbound.",

    "text": "Presentation to the members of Parliament at the Conference on US Monetary Policy convened\nby the European Economics and Financial Centre\nLondon, England\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery September 27, 2005, 9:00 AM Pacific, 12:00 noon Eastern,\n5:00 PM London BST\nThe U.S Economy and Monetary Policy\nIt’s a pleasure and an honor to speak to you today, and I thank you for the kind invitation.\nIndeed, I’m always eager to accept invitations to speak in London, because it was my home\nmany years ago, when I was on the faculty of the London School of Economics. I came to know\nand love the city then, and I’m always happy to return.\nMy main topics today are the U.S. economy and the Federal Open Market Committee’s\nconduct of monetary policy. I’d like to start with conditions in the U.S. economy, including\noutput growth and employment as well as inflation. I’ll review the recent past and indicate my\nsense of the likely path going forward, along with some of the risks that I see—especially energy\nand house prices, concerns that our two countries share in common. I’ll conclude with some\nthoughts on the course of monetary policy in the U.S.\nObviously, at the forefront of everyone’s mind are the two huge hurricanes that recently\nstruck the U.S. Gulf Coast. The human tragedy following Katrina is enormous. I know the\nnation is grateful for the outpouring of sympathy and tangible support from the rest of the world,\nnot the least of which is your own country’s offer of food, expert personnel, and search-and-\nrescue gear. We all mourn the loss of life, and we are working to alleviate the dire conditions for\nmany of the survivors. The economic consequences for the region, of course, also are enormous.\nKatrina displaced millions of people, disrupted or destroyed thousands of businesses and jobs,\nand wrought severe damage on much of the infrastructure. Hurricane Rita, of course, has\ncompounded the economic damage, however, early reports indicate little lasting effect on energy\nproduction, refining, and distribution.\nStaring into the face of such disasters, it is natural at first to want to use every tool at\nhand to try to help, including monetary policy. However, it seems clear that where monetary\npolicy can make its greatest contribution is in keeping the national economy on an even keel.\nMonetary policy, unfortunately, has little scope to cushion the immediate economic fallout\nbecause monetary actions can’t be directed only at a particular area of the country and because\ntheir effects take time to be felt. Instead, it’s appropriate to use the tools of fiscal policy—\nespecially government spending and transfers—to address the immediate crisis.\nWhen Hurricane Katrina hit at the end of August, the economy was actually doing\nreasonably well. Over the preceding two and a half years, real GDP had grown steadily at, or\nabove, its long-run sustainable pace, which, based on continued robust structural productivity, is\nestimated at three to three and a quarter percent. And in the second quarter, the latest for which\nwe have data, the preliminary estimate looks similar—that is, real GDP grew by three and a\nquarter percent. With this stretch of near or above-trend growth in economic activity, slack in\nresource use has gradually, but steadily, diminished—that is, jobs have grown and capacity\nutilization has risen. According to the latest data, which are for August, and therefore before the\n1\n\nstorm, the U.S. unemployment rate was at 4.9 percent, a number that’s near conventional\nestimates consistent with so-called “full employment.”\nAs this scenario has unfolded—above-trend growth and diminishing slack—the FOMC\nhas been able to lift its foot off the accelerator bit by bit, gradually removing the policy\naccommodation that had been put in place during the 2001 recession and then held there during\nthe slow recovery when there was a risk of deflation. At each of its last 11 meetings—including\nthe one last week—the Committee raised the federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage\npoint, bringing it to three and three-quarters percent today.\nThe goal of these policy actions, of course, is to establish a solid trajectory for the\neconomy going forward. As slack in labor markets is absorbed, real output growth must\nconverge toward its potential rate for inflation to remain under control, which, in turn, requires\nthat monetary policy reach a so-called “neutral” stance. Such a trajectory still remains a\nplausible, even probable, scenario. However, looking ahead I’d say there are a number\nuncertainties and risks that could complicate things considerably, and these were evident even\nbefore the havoc unleashed by Hurricane Katrina.\nHeading my list of risks to the economy in both the near and medium-term is energy\nprices. In the two years before Katrina struck, energy prices had surged worldwide, with the\nprice of oil more than doubling and even spiking at one point to over $70 per barrel. The\nmacroeconomic effect of higher energy prices is to dampen aggregate demand, as the additional\ndollars people spend for the same amount of gasoline, natural gas, heating oil, and so on, take\naway from their spending on other goods and services. Likewise, firms feel the bite in terms of\ntheir profit margins or the dollars they would have spent on investment in plant and equipment.\nThe intensity of this dampening effect depends importantly on whether the higher prices\nare viewed as transitory—a passing phenomenon—or as a more permanent feature of the\neconomic landscape. If transitory, then consumers and firms will tend to maintain something\nclose to their usual level of spending while the higher prices last—perhaps by dipping into their\nreserves. If higher energy prices are expected to persist, however, a deeper and longer-lasting\ncutback in spending is more likely.\nTo gauge the perception of the permanence of higher energy prices, the natural place to\nlook is at futures prices. Even before Katrina, they suggested that higher prices may be here to\nstay. During the run-up of spot prices over the past year and a half, far-dated oil futures prices\nrose sharply. Most likely, these futures prices reflected the sense that global demand for oil\nwould remain strong in an environment where there is little excess supply available and where\ngeopolitical uncertainty creates risks to existing supplies.\nWith first Katrina and then Rita slamming into the Gulf Coast, the energy situation\nnaturally has become even more severe, since that area has such an extensive drilling, refining,\nand distribution infrastructure. For example, offshore crude oil and natural gas production in the\nGulf of Mexico accounts for approximately 29 percent and 19 percent, respectively, of total U.S.\nproduction levels. Importantly, Gulf Coast refineries account for a whopping 47 percent of total\nU.S. refining capacity. While futures prices gyrated a lot around the time both hurricanes\nstruck, since then, they’ve settled back to roughly their pre-hurricane levels.\nBefore Hurricane Katrina, the outlook was for very strong growth in the second half of\nthis year, with a return to trend-like growth in 2006. Indeed, a concern at the time was that the\n2\n\neconomy’s momentum was sufficiently strong that it might overshoot full employment, adding\nto inflationary pressures. The damage and destruction from the hurricanes have significantly\nraised uncertainties about the outlook through three main channels. One is the immediate and\ndirect effects on businesses and jobs in the Gulf Coast region; the second is the longer-term\neffects of higher energy prices on consumer and business spending throughout the nation; the\nthird is the spending devoted to rebuilding the affected area\nThe direct effects will alter the near-term trajectory of the national economy. These\ndisruptions seem very likely to put a noticeable dent in overall U.S. growth in the second half,\nwhich will only be partly offset by increased government spending for reconstruction. Most\nestimates of the size of the dent run around half a percent, and that seems about right to me. This\nsuggests that growth in the second half may be only modestly above the potential rate.\nTurning to 2006, it seems likely that growth will rebound as energy production comes\nfully back on line and rebuilding kicks in. However, the magnitude of the rebound is highly\nuncertain, with considerable risks on both the upside and downside. Estimates of the extent of\nspending are escalating, and the recovery and bounce-back—fueled by massive fiscal stimulus—\ncould propel the U.S. economy on an unsustainable upward trajectory. Alternatively, the\nrecovery could proceed less quickly and less vigorously than one might hope over the next few\nmonths. Even before Rita, the pace of restarting closed oil and natural gas platforms and rigs in\nthe Gulf of Mexico damaged by Katrina had leveled off, and the prognosis for restarting the\nremaining closed facilities, as well as refineries and natural gas treatment plants, remained in\nquestion. It is too soon to say which of these risks might materialize. Some reports say the\nrecovery in oil and natural gas production and in oil refining is moving ahead faster than\nexpected. At the same time, facilities in the region are still operating well below capacity.\n* * * *\nTurning to inflation, the data on core price inflation covering the months before Katrina\nwere encouraging. Despite rapid increases in energy prices, prices for core personal\nconsumption expenditures rose at only a 1-1/2 percent rate over the six months through July,\nright in the middle of my preferred range. Core CPI inflation has been well behaved as well.\nOf course, six months of data do not make a trend, and forthcoming data bear continued close\nscrutiny, but what I’ve seen so far gives me some reassurance that unacceptably high inflation\nremains just a risk, not the most likely outcome.\nAnother encouraging development is that labor compensation is still growing at a\nmodest pace. This suggests that at least some slack remains in labor markets, a good sign for\ninflation going forward. Labor compensation growth, as measured by the Employment Cost\nIndex and measures of wages and salaries drawn from the employment surveys, remains\nremarkably subdued. An alternative index of compensation growth that includes bonuses and\nstock options, from the Productivity and Cost report, indicates an elevated rate of growth in\ncompensation per hour over the past year, but my sense is that this may be more an outlier than\na strong signal of tight labor markets and wage pressure.\nEvents in the Gulf Coast obviously will tend to push up headline inflation through higher\nenergy prices. An important question concerns the extent to which higher energy prices will\nwork their way into core inflation—that is, excluding energy and food prices. There is a chance\nthat core inflation may be raised for a time, as a part of the rise in energy prices gets passed\nthrough to other goods and services. However, a more persistent increase in inflation, such as\n3\n\nwas witnessed during the 1970s, seems unlikely as long as inflation expectations remain well\ncontained.\nDuring the 1970s, higher oil prices touched off a wage-price spiral which was costly to\nunwind. In contrast, U.S. experience since the early 1980s reveals no evidence of passthrough\nfrom real energy prices to core inflation. The crucial difference seems to be that, during the\n1970s, the public’s inflation expectations became unmoored from price stability, whereas,\nsince the early 1980s, they have been well-anchored. Evidence comes from the relative\nstability of longer-term inflation expectations as derived from the market for inflation-\nprotected Treasury securities this year, even as oil prices surged. This stability supports the\nview that the public has confidence in the FOMC’s commitment to price stability. A recent\nconsumer confidence survey recorded a worrisome jump in inflation expectations, but I would\nnot read too much into this, since the survey was conducted so soon after Katrina.\nGiven these considerations, I wouldn’t be surprised to see core PCE inflation actually\nfall a bit over the next two years and to see the longer-run trend settle in near the center of my\n1 to 2 percent comfort zone. However, the Federal Reserve cannot take it for granted that\ninflation expectations will remain well-contained. Rather, it is the job of a central bank to\nearn, through its actions, the public’s confidence in its commitment to price stability.\n* * * *\nIn addition to energy prices, the huge and unsustainable current account deficit and the\nbudget deficit pose longer-term risks to the U.S. economic outlook. Indeed, the latter is even\nmore of an issue now, with the massive rebuilding plans for the Gulf Coast. But I want to focus\nmy remarks today on another longer-term issue, namely, the housing market, as this is a situation\nthat has also been a concern in the U.K.\nThe share of residential investment in GDP is now at its highest level in decades, and this\nsector has been a key source of strength in the current expansion. The question is: will this\nsource of strength reverse course and become instead a source of weakness? Put more bluntly:\nIs there a house-price “bubble” that might collapse, and if so, what would that mean for the U.S.\neconomy? To answer this question, let me begin by clarifying what I mean by the term\n“bubble.” A bubble does not just mean that prices are rising rapidly—it’s more complicated than\nthat. Instead, a bubble means that the price of an asset—in this case, housing—is significantly\nhigher than its fundamental value.\nOne common way of thinking about housing’s fundamental value is to consider the ratio\nof housing prices to rents. The price-to-rent ratio is equivalent to the price-to-dividend ratio for\nstocks. In the case of housing, rents reflect the flow of benefits obtained from housing assets—\neither the monetary return from rental property, or the value of living in owner-occupied\nhousing. Historically, the ratio for the U.S. has had many ups and downs, but over time it has\ntended to return to its long-run average. In other words, when the price-to-rent ratio is high,\nhousing prices tend to grow more slowly or fall for a time, and when the ratio is low, prices tend\nto rise more rapidly. I want to emphasize, though, that this is a loose relationship that can be\ncounted on only for rough guidance rather than a precise reading.\nCurrently, the ratio for the U.S. is higher than at any time since data became available in\n1970—about 25 percent above its long-run average. Of course, the results vary widely from\nplace to place in the U.S. and in different countries. For Los Angeles and San Francisco, the\n4\n\nprice-to-rent ratio is about 40 percent higher than the normal level, while for Cleveland the ratio\nis very near its historical average. For the U.K., the ratio is more than double its long-run\naverage, whereas in Japan it’s only about three-quarters of its normal level.1\nHigher than normal ratios do not necessarily prove that there’s a house-price bubble.\nHouse prices could be high for some good, fundamental reasons. For example, in the U.S. recent\nchanges in tax laws may be having an effect. In 1998, tax rates on capital gains were lowered\nand the exemption from capital gains taxation for housing was raised to $500,000. Both of these\nchanges would reduce the potential tax bite from selling one home and buying another. Another\ndevelopment, which may be making housing more like an investment vehicle in the U.S., is that\nit’s now easier and cheaper to get at the equity—either through refinancing, which has become a\nless costly process, or through an equity line of credit. Both of these innovations in mortgage\nmarkets make the funds invested in houses more liquid.\nProbably the most obvious candidate for a fundamental factor—in the U.S.and in the\nU.K. —is low mortgage interest rates. But in the U.S, this phenomenon raises some issues of its\nown because there is a controversy about just why the rates have stayed so low. As I’ve said,\nover the past year, the Fed has raised the federal funds rate significantly. Normally, long-term\ninterest rates also rise with increases in the expected path for the federal funds rate. But, long-\nterm rates—such as those on 30-year fixed rate mortgages—have actually fallen over the period.\nThis is what Chairman Greenspan has labelled a conundrum because there seems to be no\nconvincing explanation for it.\nWhile the fundamentals I’ve mentioned do play a role, the consensus seems to be that\nmuch of the unusually high price-to-rent ratio for housing remains unexplained. Moreover, with\ncontroversy over exactly why long-term interest rates have remained so low, we can’t rule out\nthe possibility that they would rise to a more normal relationship with short-term rates, and this\nobviously might take some of the “oomph” out of the housing market. So, while I’m certainly\nnot predicting anything about future house price movements, I think it’s obvious that the housing\nsector represents a risk to the U.S. outlook.\nThis brings me to the debate about how monetary policy should react to unusually high\nprices of houses—or other assets, for that matter. I know you’re all familiar with the issues, as\nthey have been in the public spotlight here in the United Kingdom for some time. But let me\nframe them briefly. As a starting point, the issue is not whether policy should react at all; I\nbelieve there is quite general agreement that policy should be calibrated to the wealth effects of\nhouse prices on output and inflation. The debate lies in determining when, if ever, policy should\nbe focused on deflating the asset price bubble itself.2\nIn my view, the weight of a decision to deflate an asset price bubble rests on positive\nanswers to three questions. First, if the bubble were to collapse on its own, would the effect on\nthe economy be exceedingly large? Second, is it unlikely that the Fed could mitigate the\nconsequences? Third, is monetary policy the best tool to use to deflate a house-price bubble?\nMy answers to these questions in the shortest possible form are, “no,” “no,” and “no.” In\nthe most thorough possible form, my answers might take a few hours, and would give full play to\nthe many gray areas that are involved. Since the short answer is not satisfactory and the\nthorough one overwhelms our time limits, I will compromise and give just a brief explanation for\nmy trio of “nos.”\n5\n\nIn answer to the first question on the size of the effect, it could be large enough to feel\nlike a good-sized bump in the road, but the economy would likely to be able to absorb the shock..\nFor example, a reversion to the long-run price-rent ratio would appear to represent a shock that is\nonly about half the size of U.S. stock market collapse in 2000 and 2001.\nIn answer to the second question on timing, the spending slowdown that would ensue is\nlikely to kick in gradually, because it mainly affects household wealth. That would give the Fed\ntime to cushion the impact with an easier policy.\nIn answer to the third question on whether monetary policy is the best tool to deflate a\nhouse-price bubble, there are several points to consider. For one thing, no one can predict\nexactly how much tightening would be needed, or by exactly how much the bubble should be\nreduced. Beyond that, a tighter policy to deflate a housing bubble could impose substantial costs\non other sectors of the economy that would lead to equally unwelcome imbalances. Finally, it’s\npossible that other strategies, such as tighter supervision or changes in financial regulation,\nwould not only be more tailored to the problem, but also less costly to the economy.\nTaking all of these points into consideration, it seems that the arguments against trying to\ndeflate a bubble outweigh those in favor of it. So, my bottom line is that monetary policy should\nreact to rising prices for houses or other assets only insofar as they affect the central bank’s goal\nvariables—output, employment, and inflation. But let me stress that the debate surrounding\nthese issues is still very much alive.\n* * * *\nI’d like to wrap up with a few thoughts on U.S. monetary policy, and particularly on last\nweek’s policy meeting. Of course, the risks engendered by Hurricane Katrina were very much\non our minds and added to an already challenging situation. Higher energy prices put U.S.\nmonetary policy on the horns of a dilemma. On one side, the negative impact of higher energy\nprices on spending tends to damp economic activity, which calls for a more accommodative\npolicy, although in this case, the rebuilding effort will provide some offset. On the other side, it\nadds to inflationary pressures, which calls for a tighter policy.\nAlthough the effects of Katrina and Rita will remain uncertain for some time, it appears\nthat the most likely outcome is a significant dip in growth in this quarter and the next, stemming\nboth from the direct loss of activity in the Gulf Coast region and the rise in energy prices,\nfollowed by a rebound in the first half of next year as the region rebuilds. Given this best guess,\nit made sense to me to continue the gradual removal of policy accommodation. So, for the\neleventh straight meeting, the Committee voted to increase the federal funds rate by 25 basis\npoints.\nGoing forward, the Committee will certainly continue to monitor developments closely\nand weigh the options carefully. One option that is clearly not on the table is allowing an\nunacceptable rise in inflation. It has taken many years of consistent performance for the Federal\nReserve to earn the public’s confidence in its commitment to price stability. As William Pitt, the\nElder, once said, “Confidence is a plant of slow growth.” I would add that it is also a plant that\nneeds constant nurturing; in other words, to maintain its credibility, the Federal Reserve must\ndeliver—again and again–on its commitment to price stability.\n6\n\n1\nErratum (posted November 7, 2005).

Bernanke) the\n2017 Paul H. Douglas Award for Ethics in Government\nfrom\nInstitute of Government and Public Affairs at the University of Illinois\nWashington, D.C.\nNovember 7, 2017\n\nThank you for the honor of sharing this award with such a worthy person, my\nfriend and former colleague Ben Bernanke, and also for the honor of being associated\nwith the exemplary life and legacy of Paul Douglas.\nSen. Douglas’s contributions to ethics in government are an important aspect of\nthat legacy, but since Ben and I are the first economists to win this award, I would also\nlike to give due credit to Professor Douglas for his contributions to economics.\nWorking with the mathematician Charles Cobb, Douglas gathered data and\ncreated a statistical model that advanced economists’ understanding of the relative\ncontributions to production made by capital and labor. This work demonstrated many of\nthe methods that economists would come to use and continue to use to this day. Douglas\nconstructed empirical measures of key economic concepts. He then employed what were,\nfor the time, advanced statistical techniques to analyze these data, thereby shedding light\non a basic economic relationship. As one recent commentator put it, work such as\nDouglas’s was part of “a growing literature , , , [that] played an important role in shaping\nthe approach to combining statistical methods and economic theory that would become\nthe standard econometric practice in the later decades of the 20th century.”1\nBut, of course, Paul Douglas was much more than an economist. From an early\nage, he always seemed to be the man in the middle, seen by the two sides of a dispute as\nintelligent, knowledgeable, and impartial enough to be trusted to seek a solution. He\nmediated labor disputes and advised local government officials in Illinois. He also\nhelped governors in Pennsylvania and New York develop what became Social Security,\nunemployment insurance, and the idea of publicly owned power utilities. After losing his\n1 See p. 228 in Jeff Biddle (2012), “Retrospectives: The Introduction of the Cobb-Douglas Regression,”\nJournal of Economic Perspectives, vol. 26 (Spring), pp. 223-36.\n\n- 2 -\nfirst election for the U.S. Senate in 1942, at the age of 49 he enlisted in the U.S. Marines\nand was awarded a Bronze Star and Purple Heart for his service in the Pacific. Later,\nafter he was elected to the Senate, Douglas was a champion of consumer protection laws,\nincluding the 1968 Truth in Lending Act, and was a leading supporter of civil rights\nlegislation.\nOne of Paul Douglas’s most important achievements in public life was to promote\nethics in government. He was raised with a strong sense of right and wrong and was\nheavily influenced by the philosopher John Stuart Mill to believe that ethical behavior\nwas also an eminently practical approach to life. As a college professor, he entered\npublic life in Chicago in the 1920s somewhat reluctantly to fight the spectacular political\nand commercial corruption that was strangling the city. Once elected to office, he faced\nthe challenge of how to act ethically when corruption was so universal that the city’s\naldermen were expected to funnel large sums to their constituents, based on the\npresumption that all politicians were “on the take.” If he refused bribes and then had no\nmoney to hand out, how would he convince people that he wasn’t simply refusing to\nshare?\nThe key was transparency and communication. Everyone who asked for a large\npayment was handed a mimeographed statement titled “Please Help Me to Be an Honest\nAlderman.” At first, the public, inured to corruption, either disbelieved him or thought\nhim a sucker for refusing to take bribes. But over time, Douglas’s stand changed both the\ndemands made by supplicants and his constituents’ expectations for ethical behavior by a\ngovernment official.\n\n- 3 -\nSimilarly, in 1939, Paul Douglas was one of the first public officials in America\nto publish a full accounting of his personal finances. In his memoir, Douglas admits that\nthis and other ethical rules he imposed on himself were often a nuisance and, in some\ncases, probably went further than needed to demonstrate his honesty. But he believed\nthat the public’s trust was so fundamental to the effectiveness of government that such\nsteps were appropriate. As a senator, he continued to publish his finances and observed\nstrict limits on the value of personal gifts he received from those seeking benefits from\nhim as a public official. He strongly believed that these gift limits also made him more\neffective as a public servant, and he campaigned for legislation that ultimately led to the\nwidespread requirement of financial disclosure and limits on accepting gifts.\nI share Paul Douglas’s view that behaving ethically is both the right thing to do\nand, in practical terms, helps maintain the trust the public places in those who act on its\nbehalf. The Federal Reserve’s very effectiveness in setting monetary policy depends on\nthe public’s assured confidence that we act only in its interest. We must act ethically, and\nwe must demonstrate our ethical standards in ways that leave little room for doubt.\nI am grateful to share this award with Ben, and I am even more grateful for the\nexample Paul Douglas set for ethics in government that has guided countless public\nofficials since his day and also shaped the public’s expectation that its leaders will put the\npublic’s interests first.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n10:15 a.m. EST (4:15 p.m. CET)\nNovember 7, 2014\nPanel Discussion on “Shaping the Future of the Macroeconomic Policy Mix”\nRemarks by\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Central Banking: The Way Forward?”\nInternational Symposium of the Banque de France\nParis, France\nNovember 7, 2014\n\nI would like to thank the Banque de France for inviting me to take part in what I\nexpect will be a lively discussion.\nThe suddenness and severity of the global financial crisis forced policymakers to\nrespond rapidly and creatively, employing a wide range of macroeconomic tools--\nincluding both monetary and fiscal policies--to arrest a steep economic downturn and\nrestart the global economy. Given the slow and unsteady nature of the recovery,\nsupportive policy remains necessary.\nToday I would like to briefly review the evolution of monetary and fiscal policies\nfollowing the global financial crisis both in the United States and in other advanced\neconomies, since we have faced similar experiences and employed similar policy\nresponses. I will try to draw some lessons and provide some thoughts on the policy mix\ngoing forward.\nPolicy before the Crisis\nPrior to the global financial crisis, inflation rates in the United States and other\nadvanced economies were near their target levels and most of these economies appeared\nto be operating close to their potential. Policy interest rates were similarly in the vicinity\nof levels considered to be normal.\nFiscal deficits also appeared to be under control before the crisis. According to\nthe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), general\ngovernment deficits in 2007 were less than 4 percent of GDP in the United States and the\nUnited Kingdom, about 2 percent in Japan, and less than 1 percent, on average, in the\neuro area. Still, given relatively buoyant economic conditions, governments probably\nshould have been doing more to prepare for the long-term challenge of aging populations,\n\n- 2 -\nwhich will boost pension obligations and health-care expenditures in coming years.\nMoreover, government debt levels were already high in Japan and in some European\neconomies and not particularly low elsewhere. In addition, some euro-area countries that\nappeared to have strong fiscal positions going into the crisis depended partly on revenue\nfrom housing booms that soon went bust.\nThe Policy Response to the Crisis\nWhen the crisis hit, its global scope and severity were exceptional. Central banks\nin the United States and other countries responded by rapidly and sharply reducing their\npolicy interest rates, lowering them in many cases to near zero. In addition, in their role\nas lenders of last resort, central banks acted rapidly to provide liquidity to help stabilize\nthe financial system and support the flow of credit to households and businesses, in some\ncases creating new lending facilities. These extraordinary and creative responses showed\nthat monetary policymakers had internalized the lessons of the Great Depression.\nInitially, fiscal policy also provided significant stimulus. A portion of this\nstimulus reflected the operation of automatic stabilizers--higher unemployment benefits,\nfor example, and a decline in tax payments due to lower incomes--and some came\nthrough cuts in tax rates and increases in discretionary spending. Expansive fiscal policy\nserved to raise deficits in most countries, some of which faced further costs from\nstabilizing financial institutions, pushing deficits even higher. Sharp increases in deficits\nled in turn to escalating levels of government debt.\nPolicy during the Recovery\nThe combination of increasing debt and depressed output led to rising ratios of\ndebt to gross domestic product (GDP) in many advanced economies and heightened\nconcern about whether the growth in debt could be sustained without unsettling financial\n\n- 3 -\nmarkets. As a result, early in the recovery governments began to withdraw fiscal\nstimulus, and, in most cases, fiscal policy became a net drag on economic growth. This\noutcome was most evident in the euro-area periphery, where skyrocketing bond yields\nand deepening concerns about default left governments with little choice about whether\nto rein in stimulus. In Spain, for example, the OECD estimates that fiscal consolidation\nhas subtracted an average of 1-1/2 percentage points from GDP growth each year since\n2009. But fiscal policy also turned contractionary in countries facing less market\npressure, such as the United Kingdom and the United States. Governments in both\ncountries embarked on fiscal consolidation programs over the past four years, sharply\nreducing their structural deficits, and, as a consequence, creating headwinds that slowed\nthe recovery.\nWith fiscal drag weighing on growth and with private-sector deleveraging also\nholding back consumption and investment, monetary policy bore the brunt of supporting\nthe economy. With policy rates at or approaching zero, central banks of necessity turned\nto unconventional policy tools such as large-scale asset purchases and enhanced forward\nguidance about the future path of policy rates. These unconventional tools have, in my\nview, served to support a recovery in domestic demand and, as a consequence, global\neconomic growth.\nEven so, the recovery in most advanced nations has proceeded more slowly than\npolicymakers would have hoped. This sluggishness has been due in part to the severity\nof the financial shock associated with the crisis and the persistent headwinds to recovery\nin its aftermath. But the lack of fiscal support for demand in recent years also helps\n\n- 4 -\naccount for the weakness of this recovery compared with past recoveries.1 In the United\nStates, fiscal policy has been much less supportive relative to previous recoveries. For\ninstance, at a comparable point in the recovery from the 2001 recession, employment at\nall levels of government had increased by about 800,000 workers; in contrast, in the\ncurrent recovery, government employment has declined by about 650,000 jobs.\nLessons\nWhat lessons can we draw from this experience? The first is that governments\nneed to address long-term challenges and significantly improve their structural fiscal\nbalances during good times so they have more fiscal space to provide stimulus when\ntimes turn bad. When poor economic conditions drive policy interest rates close to the\nzero lower bound, fiscal stimulus may be more effective than usual in boosting aggregate\ndemand because it will not have the usual effect of raising real interest rates, thereby\ncrowding out private demand.2\nA second lesson is that, while even if it is appropriate for fiscal policy to play a\nlarger role when policy rates are near zero, policymakers nevertheless may face\nconstraints in implementing fiscal stimulus. This means that central banks need to be\nprepared to employ all available tools, including unconventional policies, to support\neconomic growth and to reach their inflation targets.\n1 See Greg Howard, Robert Martin, and Beth Anne Wilson (2011), “Are Recoveries from Banking and\nFinancial Crises Really So Different?” International Finance Discussion Papers 1037 (Washington: Board\nof Governors of the Federal Reserve System, November),\nwww.federalreserve.gov/pubs/ifdp/2011/1037/default.htm.\n2 See, for instance, Lawrence Christiano, Martin Eichenbaum, and Sergio Rebelo (2011), “When Is the\nGovernment Spending Multiplier Large?” Journal of Political Economy, vol. 119 (February), pp. 78-121;\nand J. Bradford Delong and Lawrence H. Summers (2012), “Fiscal Policy in a Depressed Economy,”\nBrookings Papers on Economic Activity, Spring, pp. 233-97.\n\n- 5 -\nA third critical lesson pertains to the importance of having a sound and resilient\nfinancial sector with strong capitalization and prudent risk management, supported by\neffective regulation and supervision. The recent crisis has appropriately increased the\nfocus on financial stability at central banks around the world. At the European Central\nBank (ECB), the recent comprehensive assessment is an important step toward building\nconfidence in euro-area banks. I wish the ECB great success as it takes on its new\nresponsibilities at the center of the single supervisory mechanism. At the Federal\nReserve, we have devoted substantially increased resources to monitoring financial\nstability and have refocused our regulatory and supervisory efforts to limit the buildup of\nsystemic risk. This macroprudential approach to promoting financial stability will be an\nimportant complement to our other tools for promoting a healthy economy.\nLooking Ahead\nIn advanced economies, the current macroeconomic policy mix generally remains\none of extraordinary monetary policy stimulus and somewhat contractionary fiscal\npolicy. Considering the headwinds that continue to weigh on growth, employment, and\nprices, this situation is hardly ideal. Policymakers face difficult choices as they seek to\nbalance the need for long-term fiscal sustainability with the need to support their\neconomies in the near term.\nEven so, I continue to anticipate that the headwinds associated with the financial\ncrisis will wane. As employment, economic activity, and inflation rates return to normal,\nmonetary policy will eventually need to normalize too, although the speed and timing of\nthis normalization will likely differ across countries based on differences in the pace of\nrecovery in domestic conditions. This normalization could lead to some heightened\nfinancial volatility. But as I have noted on other occasions, for our part, the Federal\n\n- 6 -\nReserve will strive to clearly and transparently communicate its monetary policy strategy\nin order to minimize the likelihood of surprises that could disrupt financial markets, both\nat home and around the world. More importantly, the normalization of monetary policy\nwill be an important sign that economic conditions more generally are finally emerging\nfrom the shadow of the Great Recession.",

    "text": "Presentation to Financial Executives International\nSan Francisco, CA\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor Delivery on April 15, 2010, 6:15 PM Pacific, 9:15 PM Eastern\nThe Outlook for the Economy1\nHello and thank you for coming. The topic of my talk tonight is the outlook for the\neconomy. I will try to keep my comments reasonably brief out of consideration for those of you\nwho need to rush home and finish your taxes! I should mention that my comments reflect my\nown views, and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve colleagues.\nLately we’ve been getting some pretty encouraging news on the economy. It’s been a\nlong time coming and is very welcome indeed. I am especially pleased to see a return to growth\nin the job market. Nonfarm payrolls grew by 162,000 in March, the best performance in three\nyears. To be sure, some of this reflected hiring of census workers. But the private sector has\nbeen expanding employment as well, and job gains were quite broad based. Indeed, private\npayrolls have risen for three straight months. The number of temporary jobs is growing and the\nlength of the workweek has been edging up. These developments show that employers are\nexperiencing a need for additional labor, which typically precedes improvement in permanent\nhiring. I don’t have to remind you how important this turnaround in the labor market is.\nThrough February, the economy had shed some 8.4 million jobs over two years. That’s the\nworst plunge in employment since the Great Depression. Now we appear to finally be on our\nway to a slow but steady rebound of jobs, which is essential if economic growth is to be\nsustained.\n1 I would like to thank John Williams and Sam Zuckerman for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n1\n\nIt’s fair to say that my own thinking has recently turned a corner and I am becoming\nmore and more confident that the economy is on the right track. For some time, we were\nconfronted with about the grimmest economic landscape we had ever seen. But about the middle\nof last year, the economy stabilized and then returned to growth. The latest indicators show a\nbroadening and deepening of the recovery, and point to solid, if not spectacular, expansion in the\nfirst half of this year. We won’t get an official reading of the nation’s first-quarter gross\ndomestic product until the end of this month. But based on the information we have in hand, it\nlooks like inflation-adjusted GDP grew somewhere around 3 percent during the first three\nmonths of 2010. Assuming that holds up, we’ve now got three straight quarters of growth under\nour belts. I expect the pace of recovery to gain momentum over the course of this year and next\nas households and businesses regain confidence, overall financial conditions continue to\nimprove, and lenders increase the supply of credit. For the full year, my forecast calls for output\nto rise about 3½ percent, picking up to about 4½ percent in 2011. Those are decent numbers, but\nnowhere as strong as some past V-shaped recoveries, for reasons I’ll go into in a few minutes.\nEven as we applaud the economic turnaround, it’s important not to lose sight of just how\nfragile this recovery is and how far we yet have to go before things return to normal. The\nnation’s unemployment rate has been stuck at 9.7 percent for three months in a row. That’s\ndown from the recession peak of 10.1 percent posted late last year, but it’s terribly high by\nhistoric standards. What’s more, an unusually large proportion of the nation’s jobless have been\nwithout work for extended periods. Of those officially counted as unemployed, 44 percent have\nbeen jobless for at least six months, a far bigger share than in any previous postwar recession.\nWhen we consider a broader measure of underemployment—one that counts those who want\njobs but have stopped looking because they are discouraged and those who are working part-time\n2\n\nfor economic reasons—the unemployment rate jumps to 16.9 percent. That’s simply staggering\nand it represents a real tragedy for our society. Behind these numbers is flesh and blood—\nmillions of people who struggle every day to make ends meet. We simply can’t be complacent\nwhen one of every six workers is without a job or is working a schedule that’s been cut short.\nI’ve already noted the turnaround in the job market. Unfortunately, I expect the pace of\njob creation to be muted, which is likely to leave unemployment stubbornly high for the next few\nyears. My business contacts say that the overhead reductions and productivity improvements put\nin place during the recession have become permanent fixtures, which could be a factor\nrestraining employment. My forecast calls for the unemployment rate to edge down to about 9¼\npercent by the end of 2010 and still be about 8 percent by the end of 2011, a very disappointing\noutlook. This is a case in which I would be delighted to be proven wrong. I see inflation\nremaining subdued, a subject I’ll return to later.\nAs we contemplate the prospect of moderate growth and slowly falling unemployment,\nit’s important to keep in mind how remarkably things have improved over the past year and a\nhalf. In the dark days following the September 2008 collapse of the investment bank Lehman\nBrothers, the global financial system was teetering on the brink of collapse and our economy was\nin free fall. The picture was the same in many other parts of the world. Many well-informed\npeople feared a second Great Depression. We were able to avoid such a catastrophe in large\nmeasure because policymakers across the globe reacted swiftly and aggressively. The Federal\nReserve and the U.S. government, in concert with other central banks and governments, took\nnovel and dramatic steps to prevent financial and economic collapse. The Fed pushed its\ntraditional interest rate lever—the federal funds rate which banks charge each other for overnight\nloans—close to zero. And our response didn’t stop there. In order to further stimulate growth,\n3\n\nwe put in place an array of unconventional programs to ease the flow of credit to households and\nbusinesses. These Fed policies and the response of the federal government helped avert a\ndisaster and set the stage for the economic recovery that is now taking hold. Overall financial\nconditions have improved substantially.\nAs we look ahead, people often ask where growth is going to come from, given that\nconsumers and businesses were battered and shell-shocked by the recession. Can we really\nexpect them to bounce back and boost their spending in ways that would support a sustained\nrecovery? I think the answer in both cases is a qualified yes.\nLet’s start with consumers, whose spending makes up a little over two-thirds of GDP.\nFor the past few months, retail sales have been growing at a solid rate. Adjusted for inflation,\nit’s likely that March will mark the sixth straight month in which personal consumption\nexpenditures have risen. Shoppers, after hunkering down during the recession, are clearly in a\nbetter mood. Over the past few years, they had cut back sharply on outlays for such durable\ngoods as cars and appliances. Now that fear and uncertainty have abated, households are\nbeginning to act on their pent-up demand for these products. And the rebound in the stock\nmarket and the stabilization of house prices means that household wealth is growing again,\nwhich should give a boost to spending. In a few cases, consumer demand is even feverish, as we\nsee with the new Apple iPad.\nI don’t mean to imply that the harsh lessons of the past few years have been entirely lost\non Americans. Before the onset of the recession, households went on a spending spree, buoyed\nby easy credit and fast-rising home equity. It was easy to get a loan to buy a car or remodel a\nhome. When the party was over, reveling consumers woke up to a massive hangover in the form\nof high debt levels, a horrible economy, tight credit, and plummeting home equity. Now,\n4\n\nperhaps belatedly, chastened households have rediscovered the value of thrift. They are\nincreasing their saving and reducing their debt loads, and they seem unlikely to revert to their\nspendthrift ways any time soon. This suggests that consumer spending will increase at a\nmoderate rate—not too hot, not too cold.\nWe’re witnessing a similar story with business spending on equipment and software,\nwhich shot up at an inflation-adjusted 19 percent annual rate in the final three months of 2009.\nThe recent data on capital goods orders point to solid, if less spectacular, gains in the first quarter\nof this year. During the recession, businesspeople focused on keeping their companies alive by\nslashing costs. Extraordinary uncertainty about business prospects combined with falling sales\nand difficulty in obtaining credit caused them to put off new projects and defer all but essential\nspending. As the economy has righted itself, businesspeople have gradually been shedding this\n“batten-down-the-hatches” mentality. The tone of business has taken a turn for the better, credit\navailability has improved, and the great fear of the unknown has dissipated. Although businesses\nremain cautious, many have pushed the restart button on projects they had postponed, such as\nreplacing old equipment.\nOne particular area that’s benefiting is information technology. An impetus for this\ngrowth is that businesses need to replace obsolete servers and other IT equipment that they held\noff procuring during the crisis. On an inflation-adjusted basis, business IT spending soared at a\nmore-than-27-percent rate in the fourth quarter, the fastest growth since the go-go years of the\ntech boom of the late 1990s. Indeed, the high-tech sector appears to be on a tear. Our Tech\nPulse Index at the San Francisco Fed, which measures activity in the sector, grew at a robust 28\npercent annual rate in the first three months of the year.\n5\n\nWhat’s the outlook for business spending? As credit conditions ease further and the\neconomy gains momentum, I expect business investment in the broad category of equipment and\nsoftware to continue to improve. Like the case of consumer spending, I think this will be\ngradual. My business contacts tell me that they see conditions improving, but that they remain\nwary and cost conscious. I suspect that the scars from the past few years will take some time to\nheal.\nOne area that still looks bleak is commercial real estate, which is measured for GDP\npurposes as business investment in structures. The commercial property market has gone\nthrough a boom-and-bust cycle that has much in common with that traced by residential real\nestate. Indeed, commercial real estate market conditions remain quite weak. Office and\ncommercial building vacancy rates are at very high levels, and indicators of future commercial\nbuilding activity are in negative territory. Spending on nonresidential construction has fallen\nsharply since the middle of 2008. Recent data don’t show any let-up in this trend. Given the low\nutilization rates for commercial property, it’s likely to be quite a while before we see growth in\nthis area again.\nThe outlook for housing is somewhat better, but the incipient market recovery we saw\nlast fall has since then charted an on-again, off-again course. Home prices stabilized in the\nmiddle of 2009 after years of double-digit declines. But sales volume has not been able to get\ntraction, even after prices tumbled 20, 30, 40 percent or more in some markets. We saw a spike\nin home sales late last fall in response to the homeowner tax credit, and we may be getting\nanother as the credit expires. But, following the worst housing collapse in decades, potential\nbuyers are, not surprisingly, leery of investing in a home, and we have yet to see any sustained\n6\n\nupward trend. In addition, housing construction won’t return to normal levels until demand\noutstrips the supply of homes that was bloated by building during the boom years.\nThe continued high rate of foreclosures also creates risks to the recovery of residential\nreal estate. More than three years after the onset of the housing bust, we’ve seen no let-up in\nmortgage delinquencies and foreclosures. This is due to several factors, including high\nunemployment and the plunge in house prices, which leaves many borrowers owing more than\ntheir homes are worth. Based on the latest data, I expect the percentage of loans that are\nseriously delinquent will continue to move higher. I am also concerned that we got a temporary\nreprieve from new foreclosures from the federal government’s trial loan modification program.\nBut some of these modifications will unravel, in which case the borrowers could face foreclosure\nagain.\nThe federal government’s stimulus program has been an important source of growth over\nthe past year, but its effects will wane later this year and next year. At the same time, state and\nlocal governments are in desperate straits as they wrestle with severe budget shortfalls. Public\nofficials will have to impose painful spending cuts and tax increases to bring these budgets back\ninto a semblance of balance, and the ripple effects of this austerity will slow economic growth.\nI’d now like to discuss current conditions in financial markets in some detail. I would\nnote that financial conditions are important for two reasons. First, they are key determinants of\neconomic activity. It is in this sense that I pointed out earlier that continued improvement in\n“overall financial conditions” would likely contribute to a gradual acceleration in economic\nactivity over this year and next. The second sense in which financial conditions are important is\nthat they may harbor imbalances that pose a threat to market stability. Of course, it was just\n7\n\nthese sorts of financial market imbalances that were the proximate cause of the recent crisis and\nrecession.\nLet me start with the relationship between financial conditions and the economy. My\nreference to “overall financial conditions” as opposed to, say, a more specific focus on interest\nrates, was intentional. While the term “financial conditions” is vague, I was including, along\nwith borrowing rates, a broad set of factors encompassing everything from the prices of stocks,\nhouses, and foreign currencies to terms and conditions on loans, availability of capital, and the\nrelative ease or difficulty of raising cash. These factors, along with yields, are important\ninfluences on spending decisions. A logical question then is how “overall financial conditions”\ncan be assessed and whether any simple metric can be developed that would encapsulate them.\nThe quest for such a financial conditions index, or FCI, capable of summarizing broad\nfinancial conditions is hardly new. Indeed, market analysts routinely compile a number of such\nindexes. But, in the aftermath of the recent crisis, further development of financial conditions\nindexes has attracted renewed interest among economic researchers. The holy grail of this\nendeavor is to formulate a single number that measures the combined influence on the economy\nof a broad array of financial variables.\nSo, what are the financial conditions indexes currently in use telling us? Right now,\nevery FCI I am aware of shows that conditions have improved dramatically since the low point\nof the crisis. Indeed, most such indexes now suggest that overall financial conditions have\nreturned to a “normal” or “neutral” stance. Importantly, though, these conditions are not as\nstrong as one would expect, given the current exceptionally low level of the federal funds rate.2\n2 See Hatzius et al. (2010) for a history of financial conditions indexes and a recent attempt at developing\none.\n8\n\nOverall, this evidence supports my conclusion that improving financial conditions are bolstering\ngrowth, but not fueling a rapid V-shaped recovery.\nLet me next turn to the second issue raised by “overall financial conditions,” that of\nfinancial market imbalances. The question here is whether there is currently any sign of\nemerging developments that might pose a threat to financial stability in the years ahead. One of\nthe key lessons of the crisis is that policymakers need to assiduously monitor financial markets to\nidentify such imbalances. As we’ve seen, excesses in the financial system can engender a period\nof abnormally fast growth followed by a crash.\nI should point out that there is no single metric we can use to assess threats to financial\nstability and the economy. This is a case in which one size does not fit all. The fact is that\nepisodes of financial excess or stress tend to be unique, both in terms of which market segments\nare affected and the way these excesses play out. For example, the credit crunch of the early\n1980s was primarily characterized by restrictions in the availability of loans. The stock market\ncrash of the early 2000s did not infect other segments of the financial system. By contrast, the\nrecent financial crisis was initially centered in the provision of credit in certain money and\ncapital markets, such as repurchase agreements, securitizations, and commercial paper, and then\nspread throughout the financial system. The idiosyncratic nature of these episodes means that\nthe Fed needs to be vigilant in looking for excesses and stresses in a wide variety of markets and\ninstitutions. To paraphrase Tolstoy, every distressed financial system is distressed in its own\nway.\nIn this regard, researchers are investigating how to design early warning systems that can\nsignal when segments of the financial system are under particular stress or are creating broader\nrisk to the financial system and the economy. Since the start of the crisis, when numerous\n9\n\nsegments of the financial system were under strain, Fed economists have been closely\nmonitoring indicators of market functioning. The metrics vary from market to market, and\ninclude asset prices, interest rate spreads, financial firm balance sheets, and credit volumes.\nCurrently, simple financial market indicators provide no real sign that significant\nexcesses or imbalances have developed in the United States. Let’s start with stocks. Based on\ntrailing earnings, the current price-to-earnings ratio for the Standard & Poor’s Composite index\nis about 20, a little below its average of 25 since 1988. Other valuation measures also indicate\nthat the stock market is currently a bit below, but not terribly out of alignment with, its past\nnorms. For real estate, we can look at price-to-rent ratios. Both residential and commercial real\nestate price-to-rent ratios reached unheard-of heights earlier in the decade, clearly signaling that\nthese markets were out of balance. It’s not surprising then that they eventually fell back to earth,\ninflicting huge damage on the economy. Current price-to-rent ratios are about 10 to 15 percent\nabove their long-run averages. Thus we find that stocks are a bit below and real estate a bit\nabove their long-term averages. But neither case shows signs of large imbalances relative to\nfundamentals.\nWhen it comes to loans and fixed-income securities, we can look at spreads relative to\nrisk-free assets of comparable maturities. During the crisis, many such spreads—including those\non interbank loans, commercial paper, and low-grade corporate bonds—rose to extraordinary\nhighs. These have since come down dramatically and are currently at or near normal levels.\nSome other financial market conditions are not so easy to measure, in part because\nreliable benchmarks may be lacking. Among the most important of these are the availability of\ncredit and liquidity. For bank lending, we have the Federal Reserve’s Senior Loan Officer\nOpinion Survey, which provides quarterly information on terms and standards for various types\n10\n\nof loans. For other market segments, growth rates of credit, leverage, debt, and measures of risk\nprovide rough proxies for liquidity and credit conditions. Very rapid growth in liquidity, credit,\nor leverage among financial institutions may signal increasing risk in the system.3 Currently,\nthere is little evidence that financial institutions are significantly expanding the provision of\ncredit and liquidity. Quite the contrary, even with very low interest rates, credit flows remain\nextremely weak.\nWe at the Fed are closely monitoring these and many other indicators of financial\nconditions to better understand the implications for the economy as well as risks to the financial\nsystem itself. This is a challenge because one can never be sure why financial conditions are\ntightening or loosening. Do such changes stem from economic fundamentals? Do they reflect\nshifts in levels of optimism and pessimism unrelated to fundamentals? Are changes in financial\nconditions linked to changes in the risk-management practices of financial institutions? These\nare tough questions to answer, but they are of vital importance in preventing the next financial\ncrisis.\nI’d like to turn now to the outlook for inflation. I’m one who believes that persistently\nhigh unemployment tends to depress inflation. When so many people are without jobs, wages\nand incomes generally rise slowly, and producers and retailers have a hard time making price\nincreases stick. We see this today. Inflation pressures are already very low and they seem to be\ndiminishing further. The headline price index for personal consumption expenditures rose 1.8\npercent over the 12 months through February. The core PCE inflation rate, which excludes the\nprices of volatile food and energy products, increased a scant 1.3 percent over the same period.\nThis figure is down from its recent peak of 2.7 percent in July 2008, before the recession shifted\ninto high gear. The downward trend appears to be becoming more pronounced. Core prices\n3 Adrian and Shin (2010).\n11\n\nwere essentially flat in the first two months of the year, and indications are that this likely\ncontinued in March.\nOf course, any inflation index is a construct made up of the prices of many different\ngoods and services, each of which is assigned its own weight. In the real world, prices of goods\nand services are changing all the time at different rates. In gauging the underlying inflation\ntrend, economists try to distinguish between price movements that are likely to persist over time\nand those that are transitory. This is why core inflation measures exclude energy and food\nprices. As anybody who buys groceries or fills the gas tank knows, these tend to be quite\nvolatile. As a result, an inflation index that includes food and energy tends to be less persistent,\nand therefore provides a less reliable signal of underlying inflation trends, than an index that\nexcludes those categories.\nThe question of food and energy prices is a familiar one. Lately though another\ncomponent of inflation indexes has received a lot of attention. I’m referring to housing prices.\nIn particular, some analysts have argued that the recent decline in consumer price inflation is\nnarrowly based because it is primarily due to weakness in the housing market. The implication,\nof course, is that housing is distorting inflation indexes and that, once housing stabilizes, the\ndownward pressure on inflation will disappear. This concern that movements in housing prices\nmight disguise underlying inflation trends has some history. Back in 2003, there was a sizable\ndecline in core inflation. Many of you may remember that we experienced a deflation scare\nthen—that is, a fear that falling core inflation might cross into negative territory and turn into\ndeflation. In fact, back then, the decline in core inflation was driven primarily by only two\ncategories—housing and autos—which were being influenced by special factors.4 Of course, we\n4 See Bauer, Haltom, and Peterman (2004).\n12\n\nnever actually experienced deflation and price indexes started a steady rise. This episode should\nprompt us to examine inflation trends with a critical eye.\nSo what of the claim that housing is once again distorting our reading of inflation trends?\nI don’t think this is a major factor. Of course, I wouldn’t dispute that the bust has sent house\nprices tumbling. But house prices are not directly included in inflation indexes. In figuring what\nit costs to live in a home, official measures of consumer prices estimate the amount of rent that a\nhomeowner would have to pay to be in the home they own. This is done by looking at actual\nrents paid for comparable homes. The result is an inflation index category called “owners’\nequivalent rent.”5 The overall price of housing used in inflation indexes combines rents actually\npaid by renters and owners’ equivalent rent for those who own their homes.\nNow, it’s true that the housing crash and the corresponding rise in vacancies of rental\nproperties have put substantial downward pressure on rents. But this can only explain a portion\nof the drop in PCE price inflation over the past year and a half. The 12-month inflation rate for\nthe cost of housing has slowed from 2.9 percent in mid-2008, when core inflation was peaking,\nto 0.3 percent in February of this year. Housing makes up about 15 percent of personal\nconsumption expenditures and 18 percent of core expenditures, excluding food and energy. If\nyou do the math, the deceleration in housing prices accounts for only about half a percentage\npoint of the roughly 1½ percentage point decline in core inflation. That equals one-third of the\noverall decline. Put differently, if we exclude housing prices, the resulting measure of core\ninflation has declined by1 percentage point, from 2.6 percent in mid-2008 to 1.6 percent in\nFebruary.\nMore generally, Fed researchers have found that, unlike the slowdown in inflation in\n2003, the fall in inflation over the past year and a half has been widespread across a broad set of\n5 See McCarthy and Peach (2010) for a description of the methodology.\n13\n\ngoods and services.6 In other words, the recent deceleration in housing prices has been matched\nby similar decreases in inflation in many other categories. Interestingly, one category where\ninflation is bucking the trend is new and used motor vehicles, which was one of the culprits\nbehind the unusual decline in inflation in 2003. The rate of auto price inflation increased last\nyear, which in part reflected the cash-for-clunkers program. Now that the program has expired,\nmotor vehicle price increases may return to normal levels.\nNo matter how you slice the data, housing prices explain only part of the downward\ninflation trend. Given my expectation of persistent and sizable slack in the economy, I expect\nboth core and headline inflation rates to edge down further, falling to about 1 percent later this\nyear and in 2011. This is below the 2 percent rate that I and most of my fellow Fed\npolicymakers consider an appropriate long-term price stability objective.\nI’d like to close with a few words about monetary policy. As I noted earlier, we have\npushed the federal funds rate down to zero for all practical purposes. Such an accommodative\npolicy is appropriate because the economy is operating well below its potential, inflation is\nsubdued, and such conditions are likely to continue for a while. Consistent with that view, the\nFed’s main policymaking body, the Federal Open Market Committee, last month repeated its\nstatement that it expects low interest rates to continue for an extended period. I agree with this\nassessment. At some point though, as the economy continues to expand, the Fed will have to\npull back some of this extraordinary stimulus.\nAs many of you know, the Fed recently completed its program of buying Fannie Mae and\nFreddie Mac securities, an initiative designed to stimulate the economy by keeping mortgage\ninterest rates low. These purchases caused the Fed’s balance sheet to mushroom to $2.3 trillion.\nBut, we won’t have to shrink our balance sheet when the time comes to push up short-term\n6 Hobijn, Eusepi, and Tambalotti (2010).\n14\n\ninterest rates. We have another tool available, which is to raise the interest rate we pay to banks\non the reserves they hold at the Fed. A hike in the rate we pay on these reserves will cause other\nshort-term money market rates to rise for the obvious reason that no bank is going to lend in the\nopen market at a rate below what it can earn by parking its money in a secure Fed account.\nIt’s logical to expect the Fed’s balance sheet to eventually shrink toward more normal\nlevels and for the bulk of our holdings to be Treasury securities, as they were prior to the crisis. I\nexpect this to be a gradual process executed in a careful and deliberate fashion.7\nI want to leave you with a sense of the tremendous progress we’ve made in putting our\neconomy back on track, even though we still have a long to-do list before we can say that we’ve\nfully returned to health. We’ve emerged from the worst financial and economic crisis most of us\nhave ever seen. That should give us confidence that we can move forward, put more Americans\nto work, keep inflation in check, and return to the economic vibrancy that our nation is known\nfor. Thank you very much.\n7 See Bernanke (2010).\n15\n\nReferences\nAdrian, Tobias, and Hyun Song Shin. 2010. “Financial Intermediaries and Monetary\nEconomics.” Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Report 398, February.\nhttp://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr398.pdf\nBauer, Andrew, Nicholas Haltom, and William Peterman. 2004. “Examining Contributions to\nCore Consumer Inflation Measures.” Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta Working Paper\n2004-7, April. http://www.frbatlanta.org/filelegacydocs/wp0407.pdf\nBernanke, Ben S. 2010. “Federal Reserve’s Exit Strategy.” Testimony before the Committee on\nFinancial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC, February 10.\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/bernanke20100210a.htm\nHatzius, Jan, Peter Hooper, Frederic Mishkin, Kermit L.

Yellen\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n2013 NABE Economic Policy Conference\nsponsored by the\nNational Association for Business Economics\nWashington, D.C.\nMarch 4, 2013\n\nThank you. I’m delighted to address the National Association for Business\nEconomics (NABE), a group that has done so much to promote understanding of the\neconomy and the appropriate role of policy.\nMy topic today is the challenges confronting monetary policy in what has been an\nunusually weak recovery from a severe recession. I will discuss the Federal Reserve’s\nongoing efforts in these circumstances to speed the U.S. economy’s return to maximum\nemployment in a context of price stability.1\nAs you know, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has recently taken\nnew steps to achieve this objective. In September, the Committee approved a new\nprogram of agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (MBS) purchases, pledging to\ncontinue the program--contingent on favorable ongoing evaluations of its efficacy and\ncosts--until there has been a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.2\nMost recently, in December the Committee announced that it would purchase longer-term\nTreasury securities after completion of the maturity extension program. At the same\ntime, it revamped its forward guidance for the federal funds rate, explicitly linking the\npath of that rate to quantitative measures of economic performance.3\nMy goal today is to explain these policies and why I consider them appropriate\nunder current conditions. With respect to the asset purchase program, I will discuss\nseveral economic indicators that I plan to consider in evaluating the outlook for the labor\nmarket and then offer my perspective at present on the program’s efficacy and costs, an\nassessment I will continue updating in light of experience.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve\nSystem. I am indebted to members of the Board staff--Stephanie Aaronson, Thomas Laubach, John Maggs,\nEdward Nelson, Devin Saiki, and William Wascher--who contributed to the preparation of these remarks.\n2 See Board of Governors (2012a).\n3 See Board of Governors (2012b).\n\n- 2 -\nThe Outlook for the Labor Market and Inflation\nThe Committee’s recent actions are shaped by the fact that the labor market is still\nfar from healed from the trauma of the Great Recession. Despite some welcome\nimprovement, employment remains well below its pre-recession peak, reflecting an\neconomy that is still operating far short of its potential. At 7.9 percent in January, the\nunemployment rate has declined from its recent peak of 10 percent in October 2009. But\nthat’s still higher than unemployment ever reached in the 24 years prior to the recent\nrecession and well above the 5.2 to 6 percent that is the central tendency of FOMC\nparticipants’ estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment. With economic\nactivity constrained by fiscal consolidation, the lingering effects from the financial crisis,\nand the added headwinds of Europe’s recession and debt problems, most FOMC\nparticipants reported in December that they expected only a gradual decline in\nunemployment over the next two years, to about 7 percent by the end of 2014.4\nThe official estimate of 12 million currently unemployed does not include\n800,000 more discouraged workers who say they have given up looking for work.5 In\naddition, nearly 8 million people, or 5.6 percent of the workforce, say they are working\npart time even though they would prefer full-time jobs. A broader measure of\nunderemployment that includes these and others who want a job stands at 14.4 percent,\n4 In the December 2012 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), the central tendency of FOMC\nparticipants’ projections for the unemployment rate in the final quarter of 2013 and 2014 was 7.4 to\n7.7 percent and 6.8 to 7.3 percent, respectively. The central tendency omits the three lowest and three\nhighest projections. The SEP is an addendum to the FOMC minutes and is available at Board of Governors\n(2013).\n5 The most widely reported estimate of those in the labor force who are unemployed--12.3 million in\nJanuary, rounded to 12 million, from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)--is seasonally adjusted.\n(Without seasonal adjustment, the actual estimate of unemployed in January was 13.2 million.) The BLS\ndoes not seasonally adjust its estimate of discouraged workers who have left the labor force, an estimate\nthat was 804,000 in January. For more on the employment situation in January, see Bureau of Labor\nStatistics (2013).\n\n- 3 -\nnearly double the 7.9 percent “headline” rate that is most commonly reported in the\nmedia.6\nThe large shortfall of employment relative to its maximum level has imposed\nhuge burdens on all too many American households and represents a substantial social\ncost. In addition, prolonged economic weakness could harm the economy’s productive\npotential for years to come. The long-term unemployed can see their skills erode, making\nthese workers less attractive to employers. If these jobless workers were to become less\nemployable, the natural rate of unemployment might rise or, to the extent that they leave\nthe labor force, we could see a persistently lower rate of labor force participation. In\naddition, the slow recovery has depressed the pace of capital accumulation, and it may\nalso have hindered new business formation and innovation, developments that would\nhave an adverse effect on structural productivity.\nIn contrast to the large gap between actual and maximum employment, inflation,\napart from fluctuations due to energy and other commodity prices, has been running for\nsome time now a little below the rate of 2 percent per year that the Committee judges to\nbe consistent with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate. The Committee anticipates that\ninflation will continue to run at or below 2 percent over the medium term. Moreover,\nexpectations for inflation over the next 5 to 10 years remain well anchored, according to\nsurveys of households and professional forecasters.\nWith employment so far from its maximum level and with inflation running\nbelow the Committee’s 2 percent objective, I believe it’s appropriate for progress in the\nlabor market to take center stage in the conduct of monetary policy. Let me therefore\n6 In my view, and as I’ve argued elsewhere (Yellen, 2013), the evidence indicates that elevated\nunemployment and the disappointingly slow improvement in the labor market are primarily the result of\nweak aggregate demand and not an increase in structural unemployment.\n\n- 4 -\nturn to the FOMC’s recent actions and describe how I see them promoting this important\ngoal.\nForward Guidance for the Federal Funds Rate\nI’ll begin with the Committee’s forward guidance for the federal funds rate. The\nFOMC has employed such forward guidance since 2003 but has relied more heavily on it\nsince December 2008, when the target for the federal funds rate was reduced to its\neffective lower bound. In current circumstances, forward guidance can lower private-\nsector expectations regarding the future path of short-term rates, thereby reducing longer-\nterm interest rates on a wide range of debt instruments and also raising asset prices,\nleading to more accommodative financial conditions. In addition, given the FOMC’s\nstated intention to sell assets only after the federal funds rate target is increased, any\noutward shift in the expected date of liftoff for the federal funds rate suggests that the\nFederal Reserve will be holding a large stock of assets on its balance sheet longer, which\nshould work to further increase accommodation.7\nStarting in March 2009, the FOMC’s postmeeting statements noted that\n“economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds\nrate for an extended period,” and in November of the same year added “low rates of\nresource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations” as\njustification for this stance.”8 In August 2011, the Committee substituted “at least\nthrough mid-2013” for the words “for an extended period.”9 This date was moved further\ninto the future several times, most recently last September, when it was shifted to mid-\n7 Empirical studies of the Committee’s date-based forward guidance suggest that changes in that guidance\ngenerated an appreciable effect on longer-term yields. See, for example, Swanson and Williams (2012) and\nWoodford (2012).\n8 See Board of Governors (2009a, 2009b).\n9 See Board of Governors (2011a).\n\n- 5 -\n2015.10 Also in September, the Committee changed the language related to that\ncommitment, dropping the reference to “low rates of resource utilization and a subdued\noutlook for inflation.” Instead, it emphasized that “a highly accommodative stance of\nmonetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic\nrecovery strengthens,” clarifying the Committee’s intention to continue to provide\nsupport well into the recovery.11\nFinally, last December, the Committee recast its forward guidance for the federal\nfunds rate by specifying a set of quantitative economic conditions that would warrant\nholding the federal funds rate at the effective lower bound. Specifically, the Committee\nanticipates that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate will be appropriate “at\nleast as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between\none and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the\nCommittee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue\nto be well anchored.”12\nAn important objective of these changes in forward guidance is to enhance the\npublic’s understanding of the Committee’s policy strategy and its “reaction function”--\nnamely, how the FOMC anticipates varying its federal funds rate target in response to\nevolving economic developments. For example, the Committee’s initial, calendar-based\nguidance did not clearly convey the rationale for the specified date. In particular, when\nthe Committee extended the calendar date, the public was left to infer whether the change\nreflected a deterioration in the Committee’s economic outlook or, instead, a decision to\nincrease policy accommodation.\n10 See Board of Governors (2012a).\n11 See Board of Governors (2012a).\n12 See Board of Governors (2012b).\n\n- 6 -\nIn my view, the language now incorporated into the statement affirmatively\nconveys the Committee’s determination to keep monetary policy highly accommodative\nuntil well into the recovery. And the specific numbers that were selected as thresholds\nfor a possible change in the federal funds rate target should confirm that the FOMC\nexpects to hold that target lower for longer than would be typical during a normal\neconomic recovery. This improved guidance should help the public to accurately adjust\ntheir expectations for the federal funds rate in response to new financial and economic\ninformation, which should make policy more effective.13 In addition, I hope that\nimproved guidance will help to boost confidence in the outlook and bolster households’\nunusually depressed expectations for income gains, which in turn will spur a faster\nrecovery.\nA considerable body of research suggests that, in normal times, the evolution of\nthe federal funds rate target can be reasonably well described by some variant of the\nwidely known Taylor rule.14 Rules of this type have been shown to work quite well as\nguidelines for policy under normal conditions, and they are familiar to market\nparticipants, helping them judge how short-term rates are likely to respond to changing\neconomic conditions.\nThe current situation, however, is abnormal in two important and related ways.\nFirst, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, there has been an unusually large and\npersistent shortfall in aggregate demand. Second, use of the federal funds rate has been\nconstrained by the effective lower bound so that monetary policy has been unable to\n13 The new guidance should serve as an automatic stabilizer in the face of shifts in the outlook. For\nexample, weaker economic data, suggesting that the thresholds will be reached later than previously\nanticipated, should lead market participants to push out the expected timing of liftoff, automatically\npromoting lower longer-term rates and an easing of financial conditions. See, for example, Yellen (2012b).\n14 See, for example, Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2000) and Rudebusch (2006).\n\n- 7 -\nprovide as much accommodation as conventional policy rules suggest would be\nappropriate, given the weakness in aggregate demand. I’ve previously argued that, in\nsuch circumstances, optimal policy prescriptions for the federal funds rate’s path diverge\nnotably from those of standard rules.15 For example, David Reifschneider and John\nWilliams have shown that when policy is constrained by the effective lower bound,\npolicymakers can achieve superior economic outcomes by committing to keep the federal\nfunds rate lower for longer than would be called for by the interest rate rules that serve as\nreasonably reliable guides for monetary policy in more normal times.16 Committing to\nkeep the federal funds rate lower for longer helps bring down longer-term interest rates\nimmediately and thereby helps compensate for the inability of policymakers to lower\nshort-term rates as much as simple rules would call for.\nI view the Committee’s current rate guidance as embodying exactly such a “lower\nfor longer” commitment. In normal times, the FOMC would be expected to tighten\nmonetary policy before unemployment fell as low as 6-1/2 percent. Under the new\nthresholds guidance, the public is informed that tightening is unlikely as long as\nunemployment remains above 6-1/2 percent and inflation one to two years out is\nprojected to be no more than a half percentage point above the FOMC’s 2 percent longer-\nrun goal.17 The evidence suggests that the evolution I’ve described in the Committee’s\nforward guidance, particularly the new thresholds, has shifted the market’s view of how\nforceful the FOMC intends to be in supporting the recovery. In the Federal Reserve Bank\n15 See, for example, Yellen (2012a, 2012b).\n16 See Reifschneider and Williams (2000).\n17 Setting the threshold above the unemployment rate’s longer-run normal level recognizes the fact that\nmonetary policy affects real activity and inflation with a lag so that, assuming inflation is near the\nCommittee’s long-run target, it will likely be necessary to begin the process of removing accommodation\nbefore the longer-run normal rate is reached.\n\n- 8 -\nof New York’s Survey of Primary Dealers, for example, participants have repeatedly\nrevised downward the unemployment rate at which they anticipate that tightening will\nfirst occur.18\nI mentioned that the FOMC’s new forward guidance offers considerable insight\ninto the Committee’s likely reaction function, but I should note that the guidance it\nprovides is not complete. For example, the Committee has not specified exactly how it\nintends to vary the federal funds rate after liftoff from the effective lower bound,\nalthough it has stated that “when the Committee decides to begin to remove policy\naccommodation, it will take a balanced approach.”19 This language is consistent with\noptimal policy prescriptions that call for lower-for-longer considerations to pertain to the\npath of the federal funds rate both before and after liftoff.\nIn addition, the guidance specifies thresholds for possible action, not triggers that\nwill necessarily prompt an increase in the federal funds rate. The FOMC statement\ntherefore notes that “in determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance\nof monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including\nadditional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and\ninflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.”20\nFor example, the Committee could decide to defer action even after the\nunemployment rate has declined below 6-1/2 percent if inflation is running and expected\nto continue at a rate significantly below the Committee’s 2 percent objective.\nAlternatively, the Committee might judge that the unemployment rate significantly\n18 The Survey of Primary Dealers is available on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s website at\nwww.newyorkfed.org/markets/primarydealer_survey_questions.html.\n19 See Board of Governors (2012b).\n20 See Board of Governors (2012b).\n\n- 9 -\nunderstates the actual degree of labor market slack. A decline in the unemployment rate\ncould, for example, primarily reflect the exit from the labor force of discouraged job\nseekers. That is an important reason why the Committee will consider a broad range of\nlabor market indicators. I will discuss some of the additional indicators I plan to consider\nin judging the strength of the labor market in connection with the Committee’s current\nasset purchase program.\nThe Federal Reserve’s Asset Purchase Program\nTurning next to that program, the Federal Reserve initiated a new asset purchase\nprogram last September, extending it in December, under which the Federal Reserve is\ncurrently buying agency-guaranteed MBS at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-\nterm Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month. As with the guidance for the\nfederal funds rate, the Committee tied the new program to labor market conditions,\nstating that purchases would continue until there is a substantial improvement in the\noutlook for the labor market in a context of price stability.21 The FOMC’s earlier large-\nscale asset purchase programs, in contrast, were fixed in size and carried out on a\nspecified schedule. The Committee has also noted that, in determining the size, pace, and\ncomposition of its asset purchases, it would take appropriate account of the likely\nefficacy and costs of such purchases.\nThe purpose of the new asset purchase program is to foster a stronger economic\nrecovery, or, put differently, to help the economy attain “escape velocity.” By lowering\nlonger-term interest rates, these asset purchases are expected to spur spending,\nparticularly on interest-sensitive purchases such as homes, cars, and other consumer\n21 The Committee also indicated that it expects the asset purchase program to end well before the target for\nthe federal funds rate is raised.\n\n- 10 -\ndurables. Research on the effects of such asset purchases suggests that what matters for\nthe reaction of longer-term interest rates to a purchase program is the extent to which the\nprogram leads market participants to change their expectations concerning the entire path\nof the Federal Reserve’s holdings of longer-term securities.22 Other things being equal,\nthe greater the effect that a purchase program has on the expected path of the Federal\nReserve’s securities holdings, the more substantial should be the downward pressure on\nthe term premium in longer-term interest rates.23 By linking the pace of purchases and\nhow long that pace will be maintained to the outlook for the labor market, the program\nacts as a sort of automatic stabilizer: As market perceptions of the prospects for the\neconomy vary, so too should expectations of the pace and duration of asset purchases.\nIn stating that asset purchases will continue, subject to caveats pertaining to\nefficacy and costs, until there has been a substantial improvement in the outlook for the\nlabor market, the FOMC established a criterion that differs in three important respects\nfrom the forward guidance for the federal funds rate: (1) It is qualitative, not\nquantitative; (2) it refers to an improvement in the outlook for the labor market rather\nthan an improvement in actual labor market conditions; and (3) it requires the Committee\nnot only to consider progress toward its employment goal, but also to evaluate the\nefficacy and costs of asset purchases on an ongoing basis. The public is, naturally, eager\nto understand how the FOMC will approach such complex judgments. I cannot, of\ncourse, speak for the Committee on this issue, but I can spell out some of the key factors\nthat will guide my conclusions.\n22 See Gagnon and others (2011).\n23 Typically, investors demand a higher return as a condition for putting their funds into a longer-term\nsecurity instead of investing in a series of short-term securities. The difference in expected returns on these\ntwo alternative investments is called a term premium.\n\n- 11 -\nA “Substantial Improvement in the Outlook for the Labor Market”\nThe first imperative will be to judge what constitutes a substantial improvement in\nthe outlook for the labor market. Federal Reserve research concludes that the\nunemployment rate is probably the best single indicator of current labor market\nconditions. In addition, it is a good predictor of future labor market developments. Since\n1978, periods during which the unemployment rate declined ½ percentage point or more\nover two quarters were followed by further declines over the subsequent two quarters\nabout 75 percent of the time.\nThat said, the unemployment rate also has its limitations. As I noted before, the\nunemployment rate may decline for reasons other than improved labor demand, such as\nwhen workers become discouraged and drop out of the labor force. In addition, while\nmovements in the rate tend to be fairly persistent, recent history provides several cases in\nwhich the unemployment rate fell substantially and then stabilized at still-elevated levels.\nFor example, between the fourth quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2011, the\nunemployment rate fell ½ percentage point but was then little changed over the next two\nquarters. Similarly, the unemployment rate fell ¾ percentage point between the third\nquarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012, only to level off over the subsequent spring\nand summer.\nTo judge whether there has been a substantial improvement in the outlook for the\nlabor market, I therefore expect to consider additional labor market indicators along with\nthe overall outlook for economic growth. For example, the pace of payroll employment\ngrowth is highly correlated with a diverse set of labor market indicators, and a decline in\n\n- 12 -\nunemployment is more likely to signal genuine improvement in the labor market when it\nis combined with a healthy pace of job gains.\nThe payroll employment data, however, also have shortcomings. In particular,\nthey are subject to substantial revision. When the Labor Department released its annual\nbenchmarking of the establishment survey data last month, it revised up its estimate of\nemployment in December 2012 by 647,000.\nIn addition, I am likely to supplement the data on employment and unemployment\nwith measures of gross job flows, such as job loss and hiring, which describe the\nunderlying dynamics of the labor market. For instance, layoffs and discharges as a share\nof total employment have already returned to their pre-recession level, while the hiring\nrate remains depressed. Therefore, going forward, I would look for an increase in the rate\nof hiring. Similarly, a pickup in the quit rate, which also remains at a low level, would\nsignal that workers perceive that their chances to be rehired are good--in other words, that\nlabor demand has strengthened.\nI also intend to consider my forecast of the overall pace of spending and growth in\nthe economy. A decline in unemployment, when it is not accompanied by sufficiently\nstrong growth, may not indicate a substantial improvement in the labor market outlook.\nSimilarly, a convincing pickup in growth that is expected to be sustained could prompt a\ndetermination that the outlook for the labor market had substantially improved even\nabsent any substantial decline at that point in the unemployment rate.\nThe Efficacy of Asset Purchases\nLet me turn next to the efficacy and potential costs of asset purchases, a topic\ndiscussed at recent FOMC meetings and that I suspect will be discussed at succeeding\n\n- 13 -\nmeetings as well. I see the currently available evidence as suggesting that our asset\npurchases have been reasonably efficacious in stimulating spending. There is\nconsiderable evidence that these purchases have eased financial conditions, and so have\npresumably increased interest-sensitive spending.24 Research suggests that our purchases\nof mortgage-backed securities pushed down MBS yields and that MBS yields pass\nthrough, with a lag, to mortgage rates.25 Indeed, I see the recent strength in housing and\nconsumer durables, such as motor vehicle purchases, as partly reflecting the effect of\nreduced borrowing costs. Plausible, albeit uncertain, estimates of the ultimate economic\neffect of asset purchases can be obtained from simulations of the Board’s FRB/US model.\nSuch simulations suggest that a hypothetical program involving $500 billion in longer-\nterm asset purchases would serve to lower the unemployment rate by close to\n¼ percentage point within three years while keeping inflation close to the Committee’s\n2 percent objective.\nOne issue on which there has been considerable debate is whether low interest\nrates are doing as much to promote economic growth since the financial crisis as they\nwould have before the financial crisis--whether the interest rate channel of transmission\nfor monetary policy has been attenuated. I agree with those who think this channel has\nbeen partially blocked. Individuals who have impaired credit histories, have been\nunemployed, or hold underwater mortgages are experiencing great difficulty gaining\naccess to credit, whether to buy or refinance a home, finance a small business, or support\n24 Empirical studies have drawn on the experience of the Federal Reserve’s large-scale asset purchases in\nrecent years, as well as from earlier episodes in the United States and from the experience with asset\npurchases in the United Kingdom. See, for example, D’Amico and King (forthcoming), D’Amico and\nothers (2012), Gagnon and others (2011), Hamilton and Wu (2012), Joyce and others (2011),\nKrishnamurthy and Vissing-Jørgensen (2011), and Swanson (2011).\n25 See Hancock and Passmore (2012).\n\n- 14 -\nspending for other needs. Even those with good, but not stellar, credit histories and\nsufficient income are facing capacity constraints in the mortgage market. However, even\nif the interest rate channel is less powerful right now than it was before the crisis, asset\npurchases still work to support economic growth through other channels, including by\nboosting stock prices and house values. The resulting improvement in household wealth\nsupports greater consumption spending.\nThe Costs of Asset Purchases\nTurning to the potential costs of the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases, there are\nsome that definitely need to be monitored over time. At this stage, I do not see any that\nwould cause me to advocate a curtailment of our purchase program.\nTo address one concern that I have heard, there is no evidence that the Federal\nReserve’s purchases have impaired the functioning of financial markets, and, while we\ncontinue to monitor market function carefully, so long as we pursue our purchases\nsensibly, I do not expect market functioning to become a problem in the future. Further,\nI’ve argued previously, and still judge, that the FOMC has the tools it needs to withdraw\naccommodation, even if the balance sheet at that time is large. These tools include a new\none, approved by the Congress during the financial crisis, which allows the Federal\nReserve to pay banks interest on their reserves. A suite of supporting tools, such as\nreverse repurchase agreements with a wide range of counterparties and the Term Deposit\nFacility, are routinely tested to make sure that the Federal Reserve is prepared to use\nthem and that they will work as planned.\nTwo additional costs have been discussed at recent meetings of the FOMC. First,\nthe expansion of the balance sheet has implications for the Federal Reserve’s earnings\n\n- 15 -\nfrom its asset holdings and, hence, for its remittances to the Treasury. Second, some\nhave raised the possibility that the Committee’s policies could have negative\nconsequences for financial stability.\nWith respect to the Federal Reserve’s remittances, balance sheet operations are\nintended to support economic growth and job creation in a context of price stability and\nnot to maximize Federal Reserve income. There is a possibility that the Federal\nReserve’s earnings from its assets and the remittances of those earnings to the Treasury\nwill decline later in the decade, perhaps even ceasing entirely for some period. It is\nimportant to note, however, that any losses that could conceivably occur would not\nimpair the Federal Reserve’s conduct of monetary policy. 26 Further, even if remittances\nto the Treasury ceased for a time, it is highly likely that average annual remittances over\nthe period affected by our asset purchases will be higher than the pre-crisis norms.\nThough our expanded portfolio of longer-term securities has in recent years\ntranslated into substantial earnings and remittances to the Treasury, the Federal Reserve\nhas, to be sure, increased its exposure to interest rate risk by lengthening the average\nmaturity of its securities holdings. As the economic recovery strengthens and monetary\npolicy normalizes, the Federal Reserve’s net interest income will likely decline. In\nparticular, the Federal Reserve’s interest expenses will increase as short-term interest\nrates rise, while reserve balances initially remain sizable. In addition, policy\nnormalization may well involve significant sales of the Federal Reserve’s agency\nsecurities holdings, and losses could be incurred in these sales. A recent study by the\nBoard staff considered the effect of a number of scenarios on Federal Reserve income,\n26 See Carpenter and others (2013).\n\n- 16 -\nbased on assumptions about the course of balance sheet normalization that are consistent\nwith the exit strategy principles adopted at the June 2011 FOMC meeting.27\nThe projections resulting from this exercise imply that Federal Reserve\nremittances to the Treasury will likely decline for a time. In some scenarios, they decline\nto zero. Once the Federal Reserve’s portfolio is normalized, however, earnings are\nprojected to return to their long‐run trend. The study supports the conclusion that the\nFederal Reserve’s purchase programs will very likely prove to have been a net plus for\ncumulative income and remittances to the Treasury over the period from 2008 through\n2025, by which time it is assumed that the balance sheet has been normalized.28\nFocusing only on the ebb and flow of the Federal Reserve’s remittances to the\nTreasury, however, is not, in my view, the appropriate way to evaluate the effect of these\npurchases on the government’s finances. More germane is the overall effect of the\nprogram on federal finances. If the purchases provide even a modest boost to economic\nactivity, increased tax payments would swamp any reduction in remittances. By\ndepressing longer-term interest rates, the purchases also hold down the Treasury’s debt\nservice costs. These effects can be quantified through simulations of the Board’s\nFRB/US model. In the simulation I described earlier, a hypothetical program involving\n$500 billion of asset purchases would reduce the ratio of federal debt to gross domestic\n27 See Carpenter and others (2013) for the Board study; the exit strategy principles are in Board of\nGovernors (2011b).\n28 The extent of realized capital losses on sales of Federal Reserve assets depends on the precise securities\nsales policy that the Committee eventually decides to undertake. An increase in longer-term interest rates\nwould lower the market value of the securities in the System Open Market Account (SOMA) portfolio. But\nthe Federal Reserve would continue to receive interest income on those securities for as long as they\nremained in the SOMA portfolio, and securities held to maturity could roll off the portfolio without the\nFederal Reserve realizing losses on them. While the authors of the Board staff study used particular\nassumptions about future securities sales that are consistent with the exit strategy principles outlined by the\nCommittee in June 2011, other strategies for sales that are equally consistent might lead to different results.\n\n- 17 -\nproduct (GDP) by about 1.5 percentage points by late 2018. The lower debt-to-GDP ratio\nmainly reflects stronger tax revenue as a result of more-robust economic activity.\nFinally, let me comment on the possibility that our asset purchase program could\nthreaten financial stability by promoting excessive risk-taking, a significant concern that I\nand my colleagues take very seriously. To put this concern in context, though, remember\nthat during the most intense phase of the financial crisis, risk aversion surged. Even in\nthe aftermath of the crisis, businesses, banks, and investors have been exceptionally\ncautious, presumably reflecting their concern about future business conditions,\nuncertainty about economic policy, and the perception of pronounced tail risks relating,\nfor example, to stresses in global financial markets. I see one purpose of the\nCommittee’s accommodative policies as promoting a return to prudent risk-taking.\nIndeed, the return to more normal levels of risk-taking and the associated normalization\nof credit markets have been vital to recovery from the Great Recession.\nOf course, risk-taking can go too far, thereby threatening future economic\nperformance, and a low interest rate environment has the potential to induce investors to\ntake on too much leverage and reach too aggressively for yield. At this stage, there are\nsome signs that investors are reaching for yield, but I do not now see pervasive evidence\nof trends such as rapid credit growth, a marked buildup in leverage, or significant asset\nbubbles that would clearly threaten financial stability.29 That said, such trends need to be\ncarefully monitored and addressed, and the Federal Reserve has invested considerable\nresources to establish new surveillance programs to assess risks in the financial system.\nIn the aftermath of the crisis, regulators here and around the world are also implementing\n29 In a recent speech, Governor Jeremy Stein (2013) discussed several areas in which a noticeable increase\nin risk-taking behavior has emerged.\n\n- 18 -\na broad range of reforms to mitigate systemic risk.30 With respect to the large financial\ninstitutions that it supervises, the Federal Reserve is using a variety of supervisory tools\nto assess their exposure to, and proper management of, interest rate risk.\nTo the extent that investors are reaching for yield, I see the low interest rate\nenvironment and not the FOMC’s asset purchases, per se, as a contributing factor. It is\ntrue that asset purchases put downward pressure on the term premium component of\nlonger-term rates, and that discontinuing purchases would likely cause term premiums to\nrise. But ending asset purchases before observing a substantial improvement in the labor\nmarket might also create expectations that the amount of accommodation provided would\nnot be sufficient to sustain the improvement in the economy. This weakening in the\neconomic outlook might bring down the expected path of the federal funds rate, with the\nresult that longer-term interest rates might not rise appreciably, on net. Moreover, a\nweakening of the economic environment could also create significant financial stability\nrisks. That said, financial stability concerns, to my mind, are the most important potential\ncost associated with the current stance of monetary policy.\nConclusion\nIn these remarks, I have reviewed recent FOMC policy actions--actions I have\nsupported because I believe they will help foster a stronger recovery and keep inflation\nclose to the Committee’s longer-run target. I recognize that the Federal Reserve’s highly\naccommodative policy entails some costs and risks. It will be important both to monitor\nthem and to continue strengthening our financial system.\nHowever, insufficiently forceful action to achieve our dual mandate also entails\ncosts and risks. There is the high cost that unemployed workers and their families are\n30 See, for example, a speech on financial stability regulation by Governor Daniel Tarullo (2012).\n\n- 19 -\npaying in this disappointingly slow recovery. There is the risk of longer-term damage to\nthe labor market and the economy’s productive capacity. At present, I view the balance\nof risks as still calling for a highly accommodative monetary policy to support a stronger\nrecovery and more-rapid growth in employment.\nThank you for inviting me to speak to you today at NABE’s spring conference.\n\n- 20 -\nReferences\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2009a). “FOMC Statement,” press\nrelease, March 18,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20090318a.htm.\n------ (2009b). “FOMC Statement,” press release, November 4,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20091104a.htm.\n------ (2011a). “FOMC Statement,” press release, August 9,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20110809a.htm.\n------ (2011b). “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, June 21-22, 2011,”\npress release, July 12,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20110712a.htm.\n------ (2012a). “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,” press release, September 13,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20120913a.htm.\n------ (2012b). “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,” press release, December 12,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20121212a.htm.\n------ (2013). “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, December 11-12, 2012,”\npress release, January 3,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20130103a.htm.\nBureau of Labor Statistics (2013), “Employment Situation--January 2013,” press release,\nFebruary 1, www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf.\nCarpenter, Seth B., Jane E.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n3:30 a.m. EDT (4:30 p.m. Japan Standard Time)\nOctober 11, 2012\nJapan in the Global Economy II\nRemarks by\nJanet L. Yellen\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nInstitute of International Finance Annual Membership Meeting\nTokyo, Japan\nOctober 11, 2012\n\nI greatly appreciate the invitation from the Institute of International Finance to\nparticipate in this session on Japan’s role in the global economy. Today, I will offer\nsome reflections on factors holding back the recovery in advanced economies, the\ncontribution that emerging Asia can make in boosting global growth, and the challenges\nfacing Japan.\nWe have seen marked differences in the strength of countries’ recoveries from the\nglobal financial crisis. Most advanced economies are growing very slowly and operating\nwell short of potential. By historical standards, their performance is even more anemic\nthat we would have expected, given the nature of the previous recession. This shortfall\nlikely reflects the unusually limited scope for fiscal stimulus at present, which very\naccommodative monetary policies have not been able to fully offset. The recovery from\nthe global recession of emerging market economies, especially in Asia, has been more\nrobust, but even these economies are slowing in the face of weak global demand, and\nthey would benefit from further progress toward a more balanced model of growth led by\ndomestic demand. Finally, until its tragic earthquake and tsunami, Japan was also\nrecovering more rapidly than the other advanced economies. But it, too, faces issues with\nthe longer-run sustainability of its debt as well as other structural challenges that need to\nbe addressed.\nThe Weakness of the Recovery in the Advanced Economies\nThe global financial crisis resulted in the most severe worldwide recession since\nthe Great Depression. Historically, such crises tend to leave persistent scars on the real\neconomy, and the current weak recovery in the advanced economies appears to be no\nexception. Economists at the Federal Reserve Board have added to the growing body of\n\n- 2 -\nresearch analyzing recessions and their aftermath, focusing specifically on the factors that\ndetermine the pace of recovery once the economy has hit bottom.1 They find that\nrecoveries tend to be faster following deeper recessions, but slower following long\nrecessions. Recoveries from recessions associated with housing busts also tend to be\nunusually weak.\nThis research finds that for the advanced economies--especially Europe and the\nUnited States--the growth in output has been somewhat weaker than past history would\nhave suggested, even accounting for the depth and duration of the last downturn.\nAlthough monetary policy has been highly accommodative, the pace of fiscal\nconsolidation in Europe and the United States has been much greater during this recovery\nthan is typical following severe recessions. Additionally, in Europe, financial strains\nhave been acute, helping to push the region back into recession. In the United States,\nspillovers from Europe and a still-depressed housing market also help account for our\ntepid recovery and elevated unemployment. As I will discuss a bit later, Japan has fared\nsomewhat better, but faces significant challenges of its own.\nThe Role of Emerging Asia\nIn contrast to the advanced economies, emerging market economies, particularly\nin Asia, recovered sharply from the global downturn, in part by using countercyclical\nfiscal and monetary policies to bolster domestic demand. Based on the research I\nreferred to earlier, the recovery in the Asian economies appears on pace with what we\n1 See Greg Howard, Robert Martin, and Beth Anne Wilson (2011), “Are Recoveries from Banking and\nFinancial Crises Really So Different?” International Finance Discussion Papers 1037 (Washington: Board\nof Governors of the Federal Reserve System, November),\nwww.federalreserve.gov/pubs/IFDP/2011/1037/ifdp1037.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\nmight have expected, given the severity of the previous recession. This swift recovery\nhas not only benefited Asia, but the global economy as well.\nLately, however, the momentum in the emerging Asian economies has weakened,\nin part as their exports to Europe and the United States have slowed. Exports to China\nfrom other countries in the region have also weakened, partly because of the unwinding\nof China’s earlier stimulus programs, but also because China’s exports to the advanced\neconomies have slowed, thus lowering its demand for imported parts and components.\nFor the moment, emerging Asia is offsetting weakness in external demand through\naccommodative monetary and fiscal policies. But ultimately, it would be desirable, both\nfor the region and for the global economy, if emerging Asia were able to rely less on\ntemporary policy stimulus and more on a fundamental rebalancing of growth toward\ndomestic demand. To be sure, progress toward rebalancing has already occurred, as\nevidenced by the substantial reduction in current account surpluses in the region since the\nonset of the global crisis. However, some of this adjustment likely reflects cyclical\nfactors, and, moreover, the aggregate current account of emerging Asia remains\nsubstantially in surplus.\nGreater reliance on domestic demand would not only help shield Asia’s economic\ngrowth from the weakness in the advanced economies; it would also boost the well-being\nof its citizens by enabling them to consume a greater share of the output they produce.\nMoreover, transforming emerging Asia into an independent engine of global growth\nwould put the global economy on a much surer footing, thus helping to achieve the Group\nof Twenty nations’ commitment to strong, sustainable, and balanced growth.\n\n- 4 -\nWhat about Japan?\nFinally, I would like to turn to Japan, whose experience combines elements of\nboth its emerging Asian neighbors and of other advanced economies. Like other Asian\neconomies, Japan shares a history of current account surpluses and export-dependent\ngrowth. Also like other Asian economies, the Japanese economy bounced back faster\nfrom the global financial crisis, at least prior to its tragic earthquake and tsunami, than\nmost advanced economies, and more robustly than in any Japanese recovery since the\nmid-1970s. Strong exports to the rest of Asia supported this rebound. However, Japan\nhas not been immune to the slowdown in trade affecting the region. Japanese exports\nhave flattened out since about the middle of 2010, contributing to a negative trade\nbalance for the first time since 1980. Like its neighbors, Japan will need to look for\nalternative engines of growth.\nNotwithstanding its similarities to emerging Asia, the Japanese economy faces\nfiscal and demographic challenges similar to those of other advanced economies in\nEurope and the United States. Japanese government spending helped propel the\neconomy’s bounceback from recession, but it has also added to public debt, which the\nInternational Monetary Fund now projects will rise to 237 percent of gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) this year, the largest among the major advanced economies.2 Along with\nthis high debt, aging of the population and slow GDP growth pose important concerns for\nfiscal sustainability.\nTo date, the savings of Japanese household and firms have been more than\nenough to finance the government deficit; indeed, interest rates on government debt have\n2 See International Monetary Fund (2012), “Taking Stock: A Progress Report on Fiscal Adjustment,”\nWorld Economic and Financial Surveys, Fiscal Monitor, Table 3: General Government Debt, 2008-13,\np. 17 (Washington: IMF, October), www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fm/2012/02/fmindex.htm.\n\n- 5 -\nfallen to near record lows. Accordingly, Japan, like the United States, has the scope to\ncarry out fiscal consolidation plans that address long-run sustainability issues without\nendangering near-term growth prospects. Currently, policymakers in both Japan and the\nUnited States face the challenge of designing policies that provide a credible commitment\nto medium-term deficit reduction without disrupting the fragile recovery. But once in\nplace, such policies should help reduce uncertainty and boost household and business\nconfidence.\nJapan would also benefit from measures to increase its potential growth, which is\ngenerally estimated to have fallen to less than 1 percent and could decline further as\npopulation aging progresses. It is widely believed that easing regulations could promote\nfaster productivity growth, particularly in the services sector. Declines in the working-\nage population also make it desirable to boost labor force participation. Higher\nemployment and faster productivity gains would help to boost economic activity, enhance\nfiscal sustainability, and restore Japan’s contributions to global economic growth.\nConclusion\nGrowth in the advanced economies is still hampered by critical challenges and\nfull recovery is likely to take several years. Emerging market economies, particularly in\nAsia, have performed better, but both they and the global economy more generally would\nbenefit by further rebalancing of their growth toward domestic demand. Japan initially\nbounced back more quickly than other advanced economies from the global financial\ncrisis, but its growth has slowed recently, and it also faces serious fiscal and structural\nchallenges. By addressing these challenges, Japan can enhance its long-term prospects\nand continue to play a leading role in Asia and the global economy.",

    "text": "Speech to the Emeryville Chamber of Commerce\nEmeryville, CA\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery Tuesday, September 12, 2006, 12:35 PM Pacific, 3:35 PM Eastern\nPresident Janet L. Yellen presented similar remarks at a Community Leaders Luncheon\nin Boise, Idaho, on September 7, 2006.\nProspects for the U.S. Economy\nThanks, Tom, for the very kind introduction. Good afternoon, everyone. It’s a\nreal pleasure to be here in “my own backyard,” so to speak. I was delighted that the\nChamber invited me to be part of your annual Outlook Conference, and I thank you all\nfor coming.\nAs you may know, next week the Federal Open Market Committee meets in\nWashington, D.C. The Committee is charged with setting the nation’s monetary policy to\nachieve its dual mandate of maximum sustainable employment and price stability.\nNaturally, I’m now in the midst of preparations for that meeting, so my focus today will\nbe mainly on the national economy.\nOf course, I’m also keenly interested in what is going on at the local level around\nthe District. One of the great strengths of the Federal Reserve is its connection to the\ncitizenry of the country. In this respect, the twelve Reserve Banks play a particularly\nimportant role. Through our directors, our advisory councils, and through meetings like\nthis one, we can get some insight into the public’s viewpoint on issues that are vital to the\nconduct of monetary policy—issues like labor market conditions, expectations about\ninflation, and industry-specific developments, to name just a few. So I’m very much\nlooking forward to the question and answer session that will follow my remarks, because\nI’m sure that I’m going to learn from you as much as you’re going to learn from me!\n\nBefore I begin, let me note that my comments represent my own views and not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nAt the last meeting of the Committee, in August, something unusual happened.\nAfter raising short-term interest rates at every one of its 17 meetings beginning in June\n2004, the Committee decided not to tighten the stance of monetary policy. As a matter of\nfact, the August meeting was the first since I became President of the Federal Reserve\nBank of San Francisco that the Committee didn’t raise rates. The August pause may\nseem a bit puzzling to some, since we had some rather bad news on inflation for several\nmonths in a row. Today, I’d like to focus my remarks on why I think the pause was a\ngood idea, and, of course, in following that theme, I’ll need to get into the economic\noutlook.\nI’ll start with a quick review of recent developments. The U.S. economy has\nsuffered some significant shocks in the past couple of years: in particular, a sustained\nsurge in energy prices and the devastation from the twin hurricanes just over a year ago.\nDespite these challenges, the economy grew at a solid clip, averaging just over 3¼\npercent for the past two years.\nThis pace of growth is moderately above current estimates of the growth rate that\nis sustainable in the long run, and it has lasted long enough to eliminate much of the slack\nin labor and product markets that was apparent a year ago. Over that time, both the rate\nof unused capacity in the industrial sector and the civilian unemployment rate have fallen\nnoticeably. Indeed, the unemployment rate dropped by about three-fourths of a\npercentage point, coming in at 4¾ percent in August. This rate is actually a little bit\nlower than conventional estimates of so-called “full employment,” and therefore suggests\n\nthat there may be some tightness in labor markets. Here in the Bay Area, we’re also\nseeing some tightness in labor markets, as the unemployment rate is just below the\nnation’s at about 4-1/2 percent.\nTurning to inflation, the recent news, as I said, hasn’t been what I’d like to see.\nHeadline inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index,\nshowed an increase of three and a half percent over the twelve months ending in July.\nWhile this is an important and comprehensive index of changes in the cost of living, the\nCommittee also focuses on a different measure—the core number, which excludes the\nvolatile food and energy components—because it is a better indicator of underlying\ntrends in inflation. This measure rose at an uncomfortably high rate of nearly 2½ percent\nover the past year. Although it is encouraging that the rate has edged down recently, it\nhas remained a bit above my “comfort zone”—a range between one and two percent that\nI consider an appropriate long-run inflation objective for the Fed.\nWith labor and product markets close to full utilization and inflation above the\ncomfort zone, one of the key questions for policy is whether economic growth will\nproceed at a moderate enough rate, and stay there long enough, to avoid a sustained\nbuildup of inflationary pressures. And that is my next topic.\nProspects for Economic Activity\nRecent data suggest that the needed slowdown is indeed underway. After hitting\na rapid 5½ percent pace in the first quarter, real GDP growth slowed in the second quarter\nto a rate of just under 3 percent. In looking ahead to the rest of the year, I see factors\nworking both to support economic activity and to restrain it somewhat. Taken together,\n\nthese lead me to expect that we’ll probably see growth that is healthy, but somewhat\nbelow the rate that is sustainable in the long run.\nThe factors working to support growth include ongoing strength in business\ndemand, fueling relatively rapid growth in spending on nonresidential structures as well\nas in business investment in equipment and software. This sector, of course, includes\nhigh-tech industries, which are important to the Bay Area economy. To the extent that\nbusiness investments in computer equipment continue to grow, this will help sustain the\nlocal economic expansion, which has picked up over the past few years as conditions in\nthe high-tech sector have improved.\nAs for factors that could restrain the nation’s growth, one immediately thinks of\nenergy prices, which have surged over the past couple of years. This increase has been\ndue to developments on both the demand and the supply sides of the market. Demand for\nenergy has been quite strong, not only from industrial economies, but also from emerging\nmarkets, most notably, China. On the supply side, there are reports of limited capacity to\nexpand production, not to mention extraordinary events that threaten to restrict supply,\nlike disruptions in the Middle East.\nIt appears that the resulting higher energy prices have restrained consumer\nspending, even while offsets from job gains, as well as growth in wages and wealth have\nkept it rising overall. Of course, further increases in energy prices could imply some\nadditional restraint. However, futures markets expect energy prices to stabilize around\ncurrent levels. If they do, then the restraint we’ve felt this year should evaporate over\n2007, and that could actually contribute to a pickup in growth next year. But that’s a\nvery big “if.” The fact is that futures markets haven’t done such a hot job at predicting\n\nwhere these prices are headed. Ever since energy prices started to rise in 2004, futures\nmarkets have usually predicted a relatively flat path going forward. When oil was $30 a\nbarrel, they implied the price would flatten out. At $40 a barrel, they implied the price\nwould flatten out. At $50 a barrel—well, you get the picture. And here we are with oil\nfluctuating around $70 a barrel. So energy prices are a bit of a wildcard.\nAnother factor restraining growth is the rise in interest rates over the past couple\nof years as the Fed has removed monetary policy accommodation. Since this process\nbegan in mid-2004, short- and intermediate-term interest rates are up substantially. Long-\nterm rates present a more mixed picture, with some—such as mortgage rates—up\nslightly, and others down slightly. The overall effect of these rate changes should be to\nreduce demand, particularly in interest-sensitive sectors, such as autos, consumer\ndurables, and housing.\nIndeed, we already have seen clear evidence of cooling in the housing sector.\nNationally, housing permits are down noticeably—by more than 20 percent—from a year\nago. In addition, inventories of unsold houses are up significantly, sales of new and\nexisting homes are off their peaks, and surveys of homebuyers and builders are showing\nmuch more pessimistic attitudes. This slowdown has been amply in evidence here in the\nBay Area, where sales of existing homes have dropped by about 20-30 percent from a\nyear ago.\nThe national data on residential investment reflect all of these developments and\nenter directly into the calculation of real GDP growth. After adjusting for inflation, (real)\nresidential investment dropped at nearly a 10 percent annual rate in the second quarter\nfollowing two small declines in the prior two quarters.\n\nThe effects of the housing slowdown go beyond their direct contribution to GDP.\nIn particular, what happens to house prices could have important effects on consumer\nspending, which is a very big part of the economy—roughly 70 percent. As we all know,\nthe pace of house-price appreciation has definitely moderated, after rising at heart-\nstopping rates in recent years. Here in the Bay Area, the pace of appreciation has fallen\ninto the single digits, after reaching about 20 percent in 2005. And there are signs that\nslower price growth nationwide may continue. For example, rents are finally moving up\nmore vigorously after a long period of stagnation. This may reflect, in part, expectations\nthat house-price appreciation will continue to slow, as landlords raise rents to try to\nmaintain the total rate of return on rental properties and as those in the market for housing\ngrow more inclined to rent than to buy.\nSlower increases in house prices could weaken consumer spending in a couple of\nways. Both of them have to do with what I’m going to call the “piggy bank”\nphenomenon. To be honest, I’ve stolen this term from some news stories I’ve seen, but I\nthink the crime is worth it because the description is apt. Back when house prices were\nrising so fast, people saw that more and more equity was being built up in their house\nvalues; in other words, they saw their houses as piggy banks that got fuller and fuller,\nfaster and faster, by just sitting there. Insofar as the piggybank of house value makes up\na good chunk of many households’ portfolios, they might well have felt that they could\nafford to spend pretty freely. In economic terms, this is called the “wealth effect.” A\nsecond factor stimulating spending relates to the ease with which households can now\npull money out of the piggy bank. With home equity loans, refinancings, and so on, the\npiggy bank is now pretty simple to access. So it’s no surprise that homeowners seized\n\nthe opportunity and drew some of the money out to support their spending. Now, with\nthe pace of house-price appreciation slowing, of course, the piggy bank is not getting so\nfull so fast anymore, which may weaken the growth in consumer spending.\nWhile it’s likely that the slowdown in the housing sector will have only\nmoderating effects on economic activity and will continue to unfold in an orderly way, I\nshould note that we can’t ignore the risk that a more unpleasant scenario might develop.\nIn particular, we have heard a lot in recent years about the possibility that there is a\nhouse-price “bubble,” implying that prices got out of line with the fundamental value of\nhouses and that the current softening could be just the beginning of a steep fall. While I\ndoubt that we’ll see anything like a “popping of the bubble”—in part because I’m not\nconvinced there is a bubble, at least on a national level—it is a risk we have to watch out\nfor.\nAnother risk has to do with household saving behavior. In the U.S., the personal\nsaving rate has been declining for more than a decade. During the 1980s, it averaged 9\npercent. This July, it was all the way down to minus 1 percent. Frankly, it’s hard to see\nhow it could go much lower. So the risk is that a sustained rise could occur, which would\nput a real crimp in consumer spending and therefore in overall economic activity.\nThough there’s some uncertainty about why the saving rate has fallen into negative\nterritory, I strongly suspect that part of it is related to the growth in consumer wealth over\nthe last several years both through rising housing values and through rising stock values.\nTherefore, the more recent softening in both of those sources of wealth may provide a bit\nmore impetus for a reversal in the saving trend; in other words, it is conceivable that\npeople will shift gears and try to build up savings the old-fashioned way, by spending\n\nless. Whatever its source, the very low—in fact, negative—saving rate represents a\ndownside risk for the economy, with the chance of sizeable drop-off in consumer\nspending likely to be bigger than a surge in spending.\nProspects for Inflation\nThis brings me to the outlook for inflation. As I’ve indicated, core consumer\ninflation has been a bit above my comfort zone recently. Therefore, in keeping with the\nCommittee’s responsibilities for promoting price stability for the nation, I believe it is\ncritical that inflation trend in a downward direction over the medium term. Indeed, my\nexpectation is that this is the most likely outcome.\nThat said, I must admit that I’m also less sanguine than I was a month ago about\none particular factor in the inflation process—namely, labor compensation. This factor is\na major component of business costs and can therefore affect the prices that firms charge\nfor their products. A month ago it appeared that compensation was growing quite\nmodestly. Moreover, for nonfarm businesses, markups of product prices over costs have\nbeen near historic highs, which means that businesses have had room to absorb higher\ncosts rather than passing them on to their customers. These two developments together\ngave me considerable comfort in thinking about the inflation outlook. However, recently\nrevised information on compensation per hour suggests that wages and benefits are\ngrowing rapidly. This blurs the picture considerably, since another measure, the\nEmployment Cost Index, shows only moderate growth. Blurry though the picture may\nbe, it remains true that markups are very high. So I do draw some comfort from that,\nbecause it means that, even with more wage and cost pressures, firms would have the\n\nroom to absorb the increases without fully passing them on into their prices if competitive\nconditions in product markets induced them to do so.\nBeyond this, I would point to several factors that could make inflationary\npressures recede. The first factor I want to discuss is a somewhat technical point. Try to\nbear with me on this, because it does matter. In statistical analyses of inflation, the data\nhistorically have exhibited persistence. This basically means that, when you’re\nforecasting inflation, it works pretty well to assume that the rate in the future will be the\nsame as it is today. The implication of persistence is frankly worrisome: Since inflation\nis too high today, persistence implies it could stay too high for an extended period.\nHowever, recent research at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco has shed\nnew light on this issue.1 It finds less evidence of persistence during the past ten years.\nThat is, rather than sticking at a certain rate, inflation has tended to revert to its long-run\naverage, which, over that period, is within my comfort zone. Admittedly, the past ten\nyears constitute a relatively small sample from which to draw definitive conclusions.\nNonetheless, this evidence is important because, if it holds up, it implies that inflation\nmay move down from its elevated level faster than many forecasters expect.\nInterestingly, this apparent decline in the persistence of core inflation has\noccurred at roughly the same time that long-run inflation expectations appear to have\nbecome well anchored. The behavior of long-run inflation expectations can serve as a\nkind of proxy for the Fed’s credibility as an inflation-fighter. For example, in the face of\nthe large energy price increases we’ve seen in recent years, this credibility shows up in\nthe stability of survey and market measures of inflation expectations covering the period\n1 John C. Williams, “The Phillips Curve in an Era of Well-Anchored Inflation Expectations,” unpublished\npaper, http://www.frbsf.org/economics/economists/staff.php?jwilliams.\n\nfive-to-ten years ahead. This may not be a coincidence. Research suggests that if a\ncentral bank’s commitment to price stability has gained credibility with the public, then\nthe persistence observed in the inflation data will tend to be dampened.\nI would like to stress that our Bank’s recent research on persistence concerns\nsimple correlations in the inflation data that can be used for forecasting only, and it does\nnot necessarily inform us about how policy decisions affect the economy or about the\nbest course for policy. In other words, low persistence is no reason for the Fed to rest on\nits laurels of credibility. Rather, credibility is something that neither I—nor my\ncolleagues—take for granted for a moment. We know full well that maintaining\ncredibility requires that we act when necessary to keep inflation under control.\nAnother reason to expect inflationary pressures to lessen has to do with energy\nprices and what is called “passthrough.” Even though higher energy prices do not seem\nto have boosted long-term inflation expectations, the energy shock may have been passed\nthrough to recent results for core inflation itself. This might seem surprising, since core\ninflation excludes energy prices. But even so, it is possible that higher energy prices\nhave passed through into the prices of core goods that use energy as an input to\nproduction—airfares are a good example. Now it’s true that recent research suggests that\nthe extent of passthrough for any given rise in energy prices has been lower in the past\ntwenty-five years than it was back in the 1970s. However, it seems likely that energy\npassthrough probably has played at least some role in recent core inflation movements.\nIn this case, if energy prices level out, as expected by futures markets, this upward\npressure on core inflation is likely to dissipate at some point, and this would help on the\ninflation front.\n\nFinally, as I’ve explained, the economy appears to have entered a period of\nslightly below-trend growth. If it continues, as I think is likely, it would tend to moderate\nany underlying inflationary pressures over time. This factor, together with the others I’ve\ndiscussed, provides reason to think that the most likely outcome is that inflation will\nmove gradually lower. However, I am keenly aware that this pattern has yet to show up\nin the data. The inflation outlook remains highly uncertain, and until we actually see\ninflation begin to slow down, I will be focused on the notable upside risks in the outlook.\nPolicy issues\nThis leads me to the concluding topic in my presentation today—monetary policy.\nAs you know, in August the FOMC decided not to raise the funds rate for the first time in\nmore than two years. I think this was the prudent course of action that properly balances\nthe dual mandate given to the Fed by Congress—to foster price stability and maximum\nsustainable employment.\nGiven that inflation is outside of my comfort zone, why do I think it makes sense\nto pause? In these circumstances, it might be thought that policy should continue to\ntighten until the inflation data move back to a rate consistent with price stability. But I\nwould argue that a gradual approach is likely to be better because there is a need to\nincorporate lags between policy actions and effects on the economy. We don’t know\nwhat the lags are with precision, but we still need to do the best we can to take them into\naccount. We simply don’t get the necessary feedback on the effects of our policy actions\nfor a long time. So if we kept automatically raising rates until we saw inflation start to\n\nrespond, we most likely would have gone too far, which would unnecessarily endanger\nthe economic expansion. Instead we need to be forward-looking.\nAnd, by a variety of measures, it appears that the current stance of policy will\nmove inflation gradually back to the comfort zone while giving due consideration to the\nrisks to economic activity. By a variety measures, I’m referring to my forecast that I\nhave outlined today, as well as the recommendations from commonly used monetary\npolicy rules that are used to gauge the stance of policy. Taken as a whole, these rules\nindicate that the funds rate is currently within the range that appears appropriate, given\nthe current condition of the labor market and the position of inflation relative to my\ncomfort zone.\nHowever, since all such approaches are inherently imprecise, policy must be\nresponsive to the data as it emerges. The advantage of pausing is that it allows us more\ntime to observe the data. When I say that policy should be responsive to the data, I mean\nthat any additional firming should depend on how emerging developments affect the\neconomic outlook. And when I say data, I don’t just mean data on inflation, output, and\nemployment. I also mean data on factors that might affect those variables in the future—\nsuch as energy prices, the dollar, the stock market, long-term interest rates, housing\nprices and inflation expectations.\nThe bottom line is this. With inflation too high, policy must have a bias toward\nfurther firming. However, our past actions have already put a lot of firming in the\npipeline. With the lags in policy we haven’t yet seen the full effect of our past actions.\nThese will unfold gradually over time. By pausing, we allowed ourselves more time to\n\nobserve the data and more time to gauge how much, if any, additional firming is needed\nto pursue our dual mandate.\nThank you for having me today, and I will be pleased to address your questions.\n# # #",

    "text": "Speech to the Seattle Community Development Roundtable and the Seattle Chamber of\nCommerce Board of Trustees\nSeattle, Washington\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery Monday, December 3, 2007, 12:30 PM Pacific, 3:30 PM Eastern\nThe U.S. Economy and Monetary Policy1\nGood afternoon, and thanks very much to everyone at the Seattle Community\nDevelopment Roundtable and the Board of Trustees of the Seattle Chamber of Commerce\nfor inviting me to join you. Seattle is home to one of the four branches of the Federal\nReserve Bank of San Francisco, and I was glad to be able to combine a board meeting at\nthe Branch with my talk to you today. As I’m sure you know, there are some nice\nconnections between the Roundtable and our Seattle Branch —Mic Dinsmore is currently\nthe Chairman of the Branch Board of Directors, and Mark Gould is our Senior Vice\nPresident in charge of Information and Technology Services as well as the Branch\nManager here.\nIn my remarks today, I plan to give you my views on the prospects for the\nnation’s economy and discuss some of the implications I see for the conduct of monetary\npolicy. Afterward, I hope there will be ample time for your questions and comments\nbecause I view these events as an opportunity for two-way communication—in other\nwords, not only do you get to hear what’s on my mind, but I get to hear what’s on yours.\nCommunication\n1\nI would like to thank San Francisco Fed staff members, especially John Judd and Judith Goff, for excellent assistance\nin the preparation of these remarks.\n1\n\nIndeed, communication between the Fed and the public has been a special focus\nfor me for the last year and a half. I was part of the FOMC subcommittee—along with\nFed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn and Minneapolis Fed President Gary Stern—that led\nthe discussions on the FOMC’s communications strategy. One outcome was the\ninitiative that Chairman Bernanke announced last month.2 This effort aims to make\nelements of the conduct of monetary policy clearer to the public by providing more\nextensive information about the Committee’s forecasts and goals for the U.S. economy.\nThis new information was first released recently as part of the minutes to the October\nFOMC meeting. So, I’d like to start by discussing some of the reasons for this initiative\nand its main features. Then I’ll couch my discussion of the economy and monetary\npolicy in those terms. As always, these remarks reflect my own views and not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nLet me begin by placing this development in context. It is neither the beginning\npoint nor is it likely to be the endpoint of efforts to improve the Fed’s communication\nwith the public about its goals and its approach to reaching those goals. Some notable\nearlier efforts include releasing a statement explaining policy decisions after each\nmeeting of the FOMC and, most recently, releasing the minutes of each meeting earlier,\nso that they are available to the public not after the subsequent meeting, but before it.\nWhy this emphasis on communication? There are several reasons. The first is\none that is fundamental to our democratic principles: the Federal Reserve’s\naccountability to the public. By making both our goals and our strategies to reach those\n2\nBen S. Bernanke, “Federal Reserve Communications,” The Cato Institute 25th Annual Monetary Conference,\nWashington, D.C., November 14, 2007.\n2\n\ngoals clearer, the public is in a better position to keep an eye on us and to judge how well\nwe are doing our job. Second, greater clarity about the Fed’s goals and strategies actually\nhelps in achieving them. For example, financial sector participants should have a better\nunderstanding of how the Committee is likely to react to economic developments, and, as\na result, asset prices and interest rates should tend to move in ways that further the Fed’s\nobjectives. Furthermore, the public’s expectations of inflation may be better anchored,\nand this not only helps the Fed control inflation but also gives it more flexibility in\nstabilizing the business cycle, the other element in our dual mandate; that is, with well-\nanchored inflation expectations, the Fed can respond quickly to disturbances that threaten\ngrowth without engendering public fears of rising inflation.\nAs I indicated, the communication initiative involves providing more information\non the economic forecasts of all of the FOMC participants. Forecasts play a role because\nthe effects of monetary policy actions are not felt in the economy immediately, but only\nafter some time has passed. These lags between actions and outcomes provide a rationale\nfor monetary policy strategies that are forward-looking —anticipating future\ndevelopments in the economy and how policy actions will influence them.\nI’ll describe the main elements of the enhanced FOMC projections briefly. The\nprojections are now released four times a year, rather than twice a year, as they were in\nthe past. They summarize the point estimates of the outcomes for real GDP, the\nunemployment rate, core inflation, and headline inflation that each participant considers\nmost likely over the forecast horizon. The forecast horizon now extends to three years,\nrather than to just two years, thus giving a better sense of the Committee’s medium-term\noutlook. The forecasts are made under the assumption—and this is a key point—of\n3\n\nappropriate monetary policy. Given this assumption, the three-year-ahead forecasts for\ninflation rates provide better insight into levels that are considered by the participants to\nbe consistent with the Committee’s mandate to achieve price stability. By the same\ntoken, the third-year forecasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate provide\nmore of an indication of the Committee’s estimates of the maximum sustainable rate of\ngrowth for economic activity and level of employment. In the long run, neither of these\nis directly influenced by monetary policy. In the short run, however, monetary policy\ndoes affect the actual growth rates of economic activity and employment. Therefore,\nbusiness cycle developments play a key role in determining our plan for policy over the\nmedium term.\nIn keeping with past practice, the Committee will continue to report the central\ntendency and full range of the independent forecasts deemed most likely by each of the\nFOMC participants. Such independence and diversity of views are longstanding\nstrengths of the Committee’s decisionmaking. Because there is often considerable\nuncertainty and risk associated with gauging appropriate monetary policy, having the\nindependent views of all participants reduces the chance of missing an important\nconsideration in any decision. One new feature is a description—or narrative—that\nsummarizes the key factors that influence the forecasts. It puts the projection numbers\ninto context, and, in particular, in the context of the basic economic “story” underlying\nthe views of the participants. The narrative also highlights factors responsible for\nchanges in participants’ views since the previous forecast. In addition, it portrays not\nonly the central tendency of the participants’ views, but also gives the flavor of the\ndiversity of views on the Committee.\n4\n\nAnother new feature relates to the characterization of risks. Forecasts are subject\nto considerable error, given the inherent uncertainty about both the underlying economic\nrelationships that drive observed outcomes and the prevalence of unanticipated shocks\naffecting economic developments. Policy must take such uncertainty into account,\nparticularly when some possible outcomes could entail unusually high costs. The new\nprojections attempt to characterize qualitatively both whether the degree of forecast\nuncertainty is greater or less than usual and also whether the risks around the economic\nscenario deemed “most likely” are symmetric or skewed to the upside or downside.\nIt is important to recognize that providing more information on our forecasts does\nnot represent a new way to do policy. Rather, it helps clarify what the Committee is\nfocused on. It also makes more explicit that the Committee is looking forward, does have\na plan to pursue its dual mandate, and is attentive to situations where the risks to its\nforecast may be unusually large or asymmetric.\nThe forecasts give the public at least some basis for judging whether incoming\ndata are consistent with the Committee’s expectations or else are surprising, potentially\nleading over time to an updating of forecasts and policy assumptions. If the projections,\nfor example, already incorporate expectations for, say, a “rough patch” ahead for output\nor inflation, incoming data confirming that “rough patch” would not typically alter the\nplan for policy. Rather, a change in the policy plan would be appropriate when the\nforecast shifts due to unanticipated developments in the financial or real economies.\nFurthermore, a change in the policy plan may also be warranted when the forecast itself is\nunchanged, but when the risks around it have changed. I will return to these important\nthemes in my discussion of policy.\n5\n\nFinancial markets\nNow let me turn to my own forecasts—both the one I held at the October meeting\nand the one I am working on for our meeting next week. At present, the ongoing turmoil\nin financial markets plays a crucial role in that outlook, influencing not only the\neconomy’s “most likely” path but also the risks around those projections. The turmoil\nbegan, of course, in mid-July, as global financial markets became highly volatile,\nincreasingly illiquid, and notably more risk averse. These developments led the Fed to\ntake actions on several fronts—as bank regulator and supervisor, as provider of liquidity\nto mitigate financial instability, and as monetary policymaker. In terms of monetary\npolicy, the Committee twice lowered its main policy instrument, the federal funds rate, by\na total of three-quarters of a percentage point to help forestall some of the restraining\neffects on economic activity of this financial shock.\nWhen the shock first hit, I expected the reverberations to subside gradually,\nespecially in view of the easing in the stance of policy, so that by now there would have\nbeen a noticeable improvement in financial conditions. Indeed, though the reverberations\nhave ebbed at times over the last four and a half months, since the October meeting\nmarket conditions have deteriorated again, and indications of heightened risk-aversion\ncontinue to abound both here and abroad.\nFor example, there continues to be a strong demand to hold U.S. Treasury\nsecurities—which are the safest and most liquid in the world—leading to Treasury yields\nthat are much lower than they were before the shock hit in mid-July. Of course, one\n6\n\nreason for the decline in Treasury yields is that the Fed has cut the federal funds rate and\nthe market expects substantial additional cuts in the future, reflecting the view that policy\nwill ease further to offset the contractionary effects on economic activity of the financial\nturmoil. But another important reason is that there has been a worldwide “flight to\nsafety.” Stated differently, the spreads of most risky assets above Treasuries have risen.\nLikewise, the cost of insuring investors against default on securities they hold,\nthrough derivatives known as credit default swaps, has jumped again in recent weeks and\nis far higher than normal. Indeed, the higher costs are particularly evident for instruments\nrelated to mortgages, with lower-rated instruments seeing especially big increases. To\nsome extent, this development may reflect heightened anxiety among market participants\nabout downside risks to economic activity, particularly housing. At the same time, greater\nuncertainty about the future is reflected in implied expected price volatility as derived\nfrom options contracts on a range of assets, from equities to foreign exchange.\nWhile risk spreads have generally risen, it is also important to pay attention to the\nactual interest rates on loans that support the spending of American households and firms.\nOn the corporate side, prime borrowers have, in fact, experienced some net decline in\nrates since the shock first hit—that is, even though risk spreads are higher, they have\nbeen more than offset by lower Treasury rates. Issuers of low-grade corporate bonds\nwith greater credit risk, in contrast, face notably higher interest rates and these rates have\njumped in recent weeks.\nThe mortgage market has been the epicenter of the financial shock, and, not\nsurprisingly, greater aversion to risk has been particularly apparent there, with spreads\nabove Treasuries increasing for mortgages of all types. Although borrowing rates for\n7\n\nlow-risk conforming mortgages have decreased, other mortgage rates have risen, even for\nsome borrowers with high credit ratings. In particular, fixed rates on jumbo mortgages\nare up on net since mid-July. Subprime mortgages remain difficult to get at any rate.\nMoreover, many markets for securitized assets, especially private-label mortgage-\nbacked securities, continue to experience outright illiquidity; in other words, the markets\nare not functioning efficiently, or may not be functioning much at all. This illiquidity\nremains an enormous problem not only for companies that specialize in originating\nmortgages and then bundling them to sell as securities, but also for financial institutions\nholding such securities and for sponsors, including banks, of structured investment\nvehicles—these are entities that relied heavily on asset-backed commercial paper to fund\nportfolios of securitized assets.\nDepository institutions are increasingly facing challenges. For example, there\ncontinue to be strains in the term interbank funding markets; in these markets, banks\nborrow from and lend to each other, with loans maturing in a number of weeks, months,\nor even a year. The problem is that banks that would normally lend their excess funds to\nother banks that need them are reluctant to do so. This may reflect banks’ recognition of\nthe need to preserve liquidity to meet unexpected credit demands, greater uncertainty\nabout the creditworthiness of counterparties, or concerns relating to capital positions. A\nheightened focus on liquidity is logical when the markets for securitized assets held by\nbanks have become highly illiquid and when the potential exists for some customers—\nsuch as struggling mortgage companies and others—to draw on unsecured credit lines.\nPressures on banks’ capital cushions are arising in part because loans they intended to\npush off their balance sheets by securitizing them have become “stuck” on their balance\n8\n\nsheets. In addition, banks may end up moving assets held off-balance sheet back onto\ntheir own books, raising regulatory capital requirements. Furthermore, many institutions\nface required write-downs of the value of mortgage-backed assets on their balance sheets.\nTo the surprise of many, these write-downs and capital strains have even hit Freddie Mac\nand Fannie Mae, the huge government-sponsored enterprises that some observers and\nlegislators hoped could provide support to the mortgage markets by taking more\nmortgages on to their own books.\nGiven some banks’ increasing concerns that their capital ratios will become\nbinding and their increased caution in managing liquidity, it is not surprising to see some\nevidence suggesting that they are tightening credit terms and restricting availability at\nleast to some extent. As yet, however, we do not appear to be at the point of an all-out\ncredit crunch as we were in the early 1990s, when so-called “headwinds” significantly\nrestrained spending and economic activity. Increased concern on the part of lenders\nabout downside risks to the economy that would harm credit quality has the potential to\ncause a further tightening of credit conditions to households and firms. This is clearly an\narea that bears close monitoring.\nTo assess how financial conditions relevant to aggregate demand have changed\nsince the shock first hit, we must consider not only credit markets but also the markets for\nequity and foreign exchange. These markets have hardly been immune to recent financial\nturbulence. Broad equity indices have been very volatile, and, on the whole, they have\ndeclined noticeably since mid-July, representing a restraint on spending. More recently,\nsome of these declines have occurred as profits have come in below market expectations\nfor some financial firms, due to write-downs of the value of mortgage securities.\n9\n\nAs for the dollar, it has been depreciating since early 2002, and has continued to\ndo so since the financial turmoil began. This development will help to improve our\ngaping trade deficit and thereby offset some of the otherwise contractionary effects of the\ntighter credit conditions and lower equity values even though a weaker dollar diminishes\nthe well-being of consumers by lowering their purchasing power.\nEconomic Outlook\nWith these developments in mind, let me review the economic situation. By the\ntime of the October meeting, the data indicated that the economy had turned in a very\nstrong performance in the second and third quarters. However, the fourth quarter is\nsizing up to show only very meager growth. The current weakness probably reflects\nsome payback for the strength earlier this year—in other words, just some quarter-to-\nquarter volatility due to business inventories and exports. But it may also reflect some\nimpact of the financial turmoil on economic activity. If so, a more prolonged period of\nsluggishness in demand seems more likely. The timing of the slowdown certainly\nmatches well with the financial turmoil explanation. Of course, much of the data that\ndrove the third quarter strength cover the earlier part of that quarter, just the very\nbeginnings of the turmoil in July and August, and therefore probably do not reflect its\neffects very much. However, the data for the end of the quarter—that is, for\nSeptember—did come in on the soft side, and the data for the beginning of the fourth\nquarter in October have shown even more of a slowdown.\nI’d like to go into this “story” in more detail. First, the on-going strains in\nmortgage finance markets seem to have intensified an already steep downturn in housing.\nIndeed, forward-looking indicators of conditions in housing markets are pointing lower.\n10\n\nHousing permits and sales are dropping, and inventories of unsold homes are at very high\nlevels. Moreover, rising foreclosures will likely add to the supply of houses on the\nmarket. It’s well known that foreclosures on subprime adjustable rate mortgages have\nincreased sharply over the past couple of years. More recently, we’ve begun to see\nincreases in foreclosures on subprime fixed-rate mortgages and even on prime ARMs.\nThe bottom line is that housing construction will likely be quite weak well into next year\nbefore beginning to turn around.\nTurning to house prices, many measures at the national level have fallen\nmoderately, and the declines appear to be intensifying. Indeed, the ratio of house prices\nto rents, which is a kind of price-dividend ratio for housing, remains quite high by\nhistorical standards, suggesting that further price declines may be needed to bring\nhousing markets into balance. This perspective is reinforced by futures markets for house\nprices, which indicate further—and even larger—declines in a number of metropolitan\nareas this year.\nThis weakness in house construction and prices is one of the factors that has led\nme to include a “rough patch” in my forecast for some time. More recently, however, the\nprospects for housing have actually worsened somewhat, as financial strains have\nintensified and housing demand appears to have fallen further.\nMoreover, we face a risk that the problems in the housing market could spill over\nto personal consumption expenditures in a bigger way than has thus far been evident in\nthe data. This is a significant risk since personal consumption accounts for about 70\npercent of real GDP. These spillovers could occur through several channels. For\nexample, with house prices falling, homeowners’ total wealth declines, and that could\n11\n\nlead to a pullback in spending. At the same time, the fall in house prices may constrain\nconsumer spending by changing the value of mortgage equity; less equity, for example,\nreduces the quantity of funds available for credit-constrained consumers to borrow\nthrough home equity loans or to withdraw through refinancing. Furthermore, in the new\nenvironment of higher rates and tighter terms on mortgages, we may see other negative\nimpacts on consumer spending. The reduced availability of high loan-to-value ratio and\npiggyback loans may drive some would-be homeowners to pull back on consumption in\norder to save for a sizable down payment. In addition, credit-constrained consumers with\nadjustable-rate mortgages seem likely to curtail spending, as interest rates reset at higher\nlevels and they find themselves with less disposable income.\nConsumption spending was moderately above trend in the third quarter, and\nthough I had built in some slowing for it in my October forecast, there are signs\nsuggesting even more moderation over the next year or so. For example, although\nconsumers will continue to receive support from gains in employment and personal\nincome, they will also confront constraints because of the declines in the stock market\nand house prices, the tightening of lending terms at depository institutions, and higher\nenergy prices.\nMoreover, there are significant downside risks to this projection. Recent data on\npersonal consumption expenditures and retail sales are not that encouraging. They have\nbegun to show a significant deceleration—more than was expected—and consumer\nconfidence has plummeted. Reinforcing these concerns, I have begun to hear a pattern of\nnegative comments and stories from my business contacts, including members of our\nHead Office and Branch Boards of Directors. It is far too early to tell if we are in for a\n12\n\nsustained period of sluggish growth in consumption spending, but recent developments\ndo raise this possibility as a serious risk to the forecast.\nLike consumer spending, foreign economic activity has been a source of strength\nfor economic activity. Foreign real GDP—weighted by U.S. export shares—advanced at\nrates of 3¾ to 4 percent from 2004 through 2006 and by over 4 percent in the first two\nquarters of this year. With the trade-weighted dollar falling for some time, U.S. exports\nhave done very well—real exports increased by an average of nearly 8 percent during\n2004 through 2006. Partly for this reason, U.S. net exports, which consistently held\ngrowth down from 2000 to 2005, actually gave it a lift during 2006. I anticipate ongoing\nstrength in net exports, but perhaps somewhat less than in recent years, since foreign\nactivity may be somewhat weaker going forward. Some countries are experiencing direct\nnegative impacts from the ongoing turmoil in financial markets. Others are likely to\nsuffer indirect impacts from any slowdown in the U.S. For example, most Asian\neconomies are now enjoying exceptionally buoyant conditions. But the U.S. and Asian\neconomies are not decoupled, and a slowdown here is likely to produce ripple effects\nlowering growth there through trade linkages.\nI don’t want to give the impression that all of the available recent data have been\nweak or overemphasize the downside risks. There are some significant areas of strength.\nIn particular, labor markets have been fairly robust in recent months. As I mentioned\nbefore, the growth of jobs is an important element in generating the expansion of\npersonal income needed to support consumption spending, which is a key factor for the\noverall health of the economy. In addition, business investment in equipment and\nsoftware also has been fairly strong, although here too, recent data suggest some\n13\n\ndeceleration. Despite the hike in borrowing costs for higher-risk corporate borrowers and\nthe illiquidity in markets for collateralized loan obligations, it appears that financing for\ncapital spending for most firms remains readily available on terms that have been little\naffected by the recent financial turmoil.\nTo sum up the story on the outlook for real GDP growth, my own view is that,\nunder appropriate monetary policy, the economy is still likely to achieve a relatively\nsmooth adjustment path, with real GDP growth gradually returning to its roughly 2½\npercent trend over the next year or so, and the unemployment rate rising only very\ngradually to just above its 4¾ percent sustainable level. However, for the next few\nquarters, there are signs that growth may come in somewhat lower than I had previously\nthought likely. For example, some of the risks that I worried about in my earlier forecast\nhave materialized—the turmoil in financial markets has not subsided as much as I had\nhoped, and some data on personal consumption have come in weaker than expected. I\ncontinue to see the growth risks as skewed to the downside in part because increased\nperceptions of downside economic risk may induce greater caution by lenders,\nhouseholds, and firms.\nTurning to inflation, signs of improvement in underlying inflationary pressures\nare evident in recent data. Over the past twelve months, the price index for the measure\nof consumer inflation on which the FOMC bases its forecasts—personal consumption\nexpenditures excluding food and energy, or the core PCE price index—has increased by\n1.9 percent. Just several months ago, the twelve-month change was quite a bit higher, at\nnearly 2½ percent.\n14\n\nIt seems most likely that core PCE price inflation will edge down to around 1¾\npercent over the next few years under appropriate policy and the gap between total and\ncore PCE inflation will diminish substantially. Such an outcome is broadly consistent\nwith my interpretation of the Fed’s price stability mandate. This view is predicated on\ncontinued well-anchored inflation expectations. It also assumes the emergence of a slight\namount of slack in the labor market, as well as the ebbing of the upward effects of\nmovements in energy and commodity prices. However, we do still face some inflation\nrisks, mainly due to faster increases in unit labor costs, the depreciation of the dollar, and\nthe continuing upside surprises in energy prices. Moreover, labor markets have\ncontinued to surprise on the strong side. All of these factors will need to be watched\ncarefully going forward.\nMonetary policy\nNow I’d like to turn to monetary policy. In September, the Committee reduced\nthe federal funds rate target by 50 basis points, and in late October lowered the target by\nanother 25 basis points. These actions reflected the Committee’s concern that the\nfinancial shock had the potential to intensify the housing correction and thereby to\nrestrain economic growth more generally. The steps were meant to help forestall some of\nthe potential fallout to the economy from the disruptions in financial markets and to\npromote moderate growth over time.\nIn line with the forecast-based policy I’ve described, the Committee’s decisions\nreflected a forward-looking and preemptive approach. In particular, I supported putting a\nsubstantial easing in place so as not to fall “behind the curve.” Given the long lags\n15\n\nbetween policy actions and their impact on the economy, and the possibility that\neconomic downturns can be difficult to reverse once they take hold, an approach that was\nmore gradual and reactive than this would have created unnecessary economic risks.\nSince the October FOMC meeting, financial conditions have deteriorated, and we\nhave seen some unexpected softening in the economic data. These developments\nnecessitate some rethinking of my growth forecast, and have highlighted the downside\nskew in the risks to that forecast. On the inflation front, I continue to expect core\nconsumer prices to rise at a pace that is broadly consistent with price stability, although\nthere are some notable upside risks that bear careful watching and consideration.\nAdditional data bearing on the outlook will become available before the FOMC’s\nmeeting next week, and this information must also be factored into an assessment of the\neconomy’s prospects.\nI hope these remarks provide an indication of the issues that will be on my mind\nas I assess the appropriate approach to policy that will foster full employment while\nmaintaining the success we have achieved on our price stability objective.\nNow I’d be pleased to take any questions or hear any of your thoughts on these\nimportant issues.\n# # #\n16",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n12:30 p.m. EDT\nJuly 10, 2015\nRecent Developments and the Outlook for the Economy\nRemarks by\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe City Club of Cleveland\nCleveland, Ohio\nJuly 10, 2015\n\nThank you, President Mester, and thank you to the City Club for inviting me to\nspeak today. I am aware of the club’s history and its tradition of promoting the free\nexchange of ideas, and I will do my best to allow plenty of time for your questions, which\nI understand are an important part of that tradition.\nCommunicating with the public is an important part of my job. A few weeks ago,\nI held a news conference after the latest meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC). Next week I will deliver the Federal Reserve’s semiannual report on monetary\npolicy and answer questions from members of Congress at public hearings of the House\nand the Senate.\nOn those occasions and in appearances such as this one today, the aim is to\naccount for the FOMC’s policy actions and explain how they are intended to achieve the\nspecific goals that the Congress has assigned us. We do so because it is important that\nthe Federal Reserve remains accountable within the framework of our democracy. We\nalso do so because we can more effectively achieve our mandated goals--maximum\nemployment and price stability--as well as help maintain stability in the financial system\nif people understand what we are doing and why. Finally, it’s important for us to hear\nperspectives and experiences from a wide range of participants in the economy. This\nclub stands for free and open communication, and so does the Federal Reserve.\nThe Recovery from the Great Recession\nThis month marks six years since the end of the Great Recession--our nation’s\nmost severe economic downturn since the 1930s. U.S. economic output--as measured by\ninflation-adjusted gross domestic product, or real GDP--fell more than 4 percent from the\nend of 2007 to the middle of 2009. One of the hardest-hit industries was manufacturing,\n\n- 2 -\nwhich, as you well know, is important to Ohio. The unemployment rate peaked at 10\npercent nationally, and it reached 11 percent here in Ohio. U.S. nonfarm payrolls shrank\nby 8-1/2 million jobs during 2008 and 2009, or about 6 percent of the national workforce.\nOver that same period, Ohio lost more than 400,000 jobs, or 7-1/2 percent of the state’s\nemployment.\nIn response to the financial crisis, the severe recession, and the risk that inflation\nwould fall persistently far below levels consistent with price stability, we at the Federal\nReserve took forceful actions. The FOMC aggressively cut our short-term interest rate\ntarget, the federal funds rate, from above 5 percent to near zero by the end of 2008 to\nlower borrowing costs and help spur household spending and business investment. With\nshort-term interest rates near zero, the FOMC provided further support to the economy\nthrough our large-scale asset purchases--buying large amounts of Treasury and mortgage-\nrelated securities in the open market. These purchases pushed down longer-term\nborrowing rates for millions of American families and businesses. During the economic\nrecovery, we put additional downward pressure on longer-term borrowing rates by\nexplaining publicly that we intended to keep short-term interest rates low for a long time.\nLonger-term borrowing rates, such as those for mortgages and automobile loans, are\nlower if people expect short-term rates in the future to remain low or to rise only very\ngradually.\nAlthough evidence suggests that our policy actions were effective, the pace of the\neconomic recovery has been slow.1 Growth in real GDP has averaged only about\n1 A number of studies have found that the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases put downward pressure on\nlong-term interest rates. These include Joseph Gagnon, Matthew Raskin, Julie Remache, and Brian Sack\n(2011), “The Financial Market Effects of the Federal Reserve’s Large-Scale Asset Purchases,”\nInternational Journal of Central Banking, vol. 7 (March), pp. 3-43; and Stefania D’Amico, William\n\n- 3 -\n2-1/4 percent per year since 2009, about 1 percentage point less than the average rate\nseen over the 25 years preceding the Great Recession. In Ohio, economic output has\nincreased at about the same pace as in the nation as a whole in recent years. In the labor\nmarket, the U.S. unemployment rate stood at 5.3 percent in June, around half as high as\nits peak after the recession and close to many economists’ assessment of its longer-run\nnatural rate--the level that can be sustained without risking excessive inflation. The U.S.\neconomy has created 12 million jobs since the labor market’s low point, and total\nnonfarm payrolls are now 3-1/2 million greater than just prior to the recession. Ohio’s\nunemployment rate has declined even more during the recovery than the nation as a\nwhole, and at 5.2 percent in May, it was somewhat below the U.S. average in that month.\nNevertheless, although nonfarm payrolls in Ohio have increased by around 400,000 jobs\nsince the low point for the state’s employment, payrolls have yet to surpass their level\njust prior to the recession.\nManufacturing is important to Ohio, and people here are keenly aware of the\nchallenges that American manufacturing has faced for many years. U.S. manufacturing\noutput--as measured in the Federal Reserve’s index of industrial production--plunged\nabout 20 percent during the recession. That’s substantially more than the overall\npercentage decline in economic output. Partly as a result, U.S. manufacturing\nemployment fell 2-1/4 million during 2008 and 2009, a significantly larger percentage\ndecline than occurred in overall employment. And while manufacturing employment\nEnglish, David López-Salido, and Edward Nelson (2012), “The Federal Reserve’s Large-Scale Asset\nPurchase Programs: Rationale and Effects,” Economic Journal, vol. 122 (November), pp. F415-46.\nMoreover, the Federal Reserve’s forward guidance and asset purchase policies have been estimated to have\nhelped lower unemployment and boost inflation; see Eric M. Engen, Thomas Laubach, and David\nReifschneider (2015), “The Macroeconomic Effects of the Federal Reserve’s Unconventional Monetary\nPolicies,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2015-005 (Washington: Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System, January), http://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2015.005.\n\n- 4 -\nnationwide has increased about 850,000 since the end of 2009 as production has\nrecovered, there are still almost 1-1/2 million fewer manufacturing jobs than just before\nthe recession.\nUnfortunately, the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs has been generally\ndecreasing since its peak in the late 1970s. A similar trend has also been seen in Ohio,\nwhere manufacturing jobs have shrunk from about 25 percent of the state’s private-sector\nemployment in 1990 to about 15 percent now. So, some of the decline in manufacturing\njobs since the recession reflects the longer-term structural downtrend of employment in\nthis sector. But labeling a part of the losses in manufacturing jobs as structural, rather\nthan related to the recession, in no way diminishes how wrenching those losses have\nbeen. This painful trend reflects a number of long-term challenges faced by domestic\nmanufacturers, including the relative costs of labor and investment in producing\ndomestically versus abroad. However, U.S. factory workers, on average, are more\nproductive than their counterparts abroad, and domestic manufacturers report that they\nare looking for more workers with these greater skills as they increase their use of\nautomation and redesign their production processes.\nCurrent Conditions in the Labor Market\nAs I noted, the national unemployment rate has declined markedly during the\neconomic recovery. But it is my judgment that the lower level of the unemployment rate\ntoday probably does not fully capture the extent of slack remaining in the labor market--\nin other words, how far away we are from a full-employment economy. In assessing\nlabor market slack, we try to distinguish between the effects of cyclical fluctuations in the\neconomy and the influences of longer-term structural changes, such as the aging of the\n\n- 5 -\nworkforce and other demographic trends. Cyclical and structural factors both have\naffected a number of measures of labor market outcomes that bear on our assessment of\nslack, including labor force participation (that is, how many people are working or are\nactively looking for work), the number of people working part time who would rather\nwork full time, the pace of hiring, and the rate at which people are quitting jobs.\nLet’s first consider the labor force participation rate. It continued to decline\nsubstantially after the recession ended, with the pace of those declines slowing only over\nthe past year or so even as the unemployment rate has continued to fall. Many working-\nage people who are not in the labor force have chosen that status voluntarily; examples\nwould include retirees, teenagers and young adults in school, and people staying home to\ncare for children and other dependent family members. Even in a stronger job market, it\nis likely that many of these individuals would prefer not to work. And, indeed, a\nnoticeable portion of the decline in labor force participation seen over the past decade or\nso clearly relates to the aging of baby boomers and their ongoing retirements.2 However,\nthe pace of decline in the participation rate accelerated during the recession, as some\nindividuals who lost their jobs became discouraged and stopped looking for work. It\nappears that, despite a drop in the participation rate reported in June, the pace of this\ndecline has slowed since early last year. Nevertheless I think a significant number of\nindividuals still are not seeking work because they perceive a lack of good job\nopportunities, and that a stronger economy would draw some of them back into the labor\nforce.\n2 See Stephanie Aaronson, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis-Reig, Christopher Smith, and\nWilliam Wascher (2014), “Labor Force Participation: Recent Developments and Future Prospects,”\nBrookings Papers on Economic Activity, Fall, pp. 197-275,\nwww.brookings.edu/~/media/Projects/BPEA/Fall-2014/Fall2014BPEA_Aaronson_et_al.pdf.\n\n- 6 -\nAnother factor we consider when assessing labor market slack is the elevated\nnumber of workers who are employed in part-time jobs but would prefer to have full-time\nwork--in other words, those classified as “part time for economic reasons.” At around\n4-1/2 percent of employment, the share of such workers is notably larger than has been\nhistorically typical in a growing economy. Some portion of the greater share of workers\nwho are part time for economic reasons may reflect structural rather than cyclical\nfactors.3 For example, the ongoing shift in employment away from manufacturing and\ntoward services, a sector which historically relied more heavily on part-time workers,\nmay be boosting the share of part-time jobs. Despite these structural trends, which make\nit difficult to know where the share of those employed part time for economic reasons\nmay settle in the longer run, I continue to think that it probably remains higher than it\nwould be in a full-employment economy.\nOther indicators also generally corroborate the view that while the labor market\nhas improved, it still has not fully recovered. For example, the rate at which employees\nquit their jobs for other opportunities has tended to go up in a strong economy, since\nmore workers voluntarily leave their jobs when they have greater confidence about their\nability to find new ones and when firms are competing more actively for new hires.\nIndeed, the quits rate has picked up as the labor market has improved over the past few\nyears, but it still is not as high as it was through much of the early 2000s. Another\nimportant indicator is the number of available positions, or job openings, that employers\ncurrently have posted. Job openings have increased significantly over the past year and a\n3 See Tomaz Cajner, Dennis Mawhirter, Christopher Nekarda, and David Ratner (2014), “Why Is\nInvoluntary Part-Time Work Elevated?” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System, April 14), www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/notes/feds-notes/2014/why-is-\ninvoluntary-part-time-work-elevated-20140414.html.\n\n- 7 -\nhalf, and, in another encouraging sign, the pace of hiring has also stepped up in the past\nyear or so, though it too continues to run somewhat below the levels that prevailed\nthrough the middle part of the last decade.\nFinally, the pace of wage increases also may help shed some light on the degree\nof labor market slack, since wage movements historically have tended to respond to the\ndegree of tightness in the labor market. Here too, however, the signal is not entirely\nclear, as other factors such as longer-run trends in productivity growth also generally\ninfluence the growth of compensation. Key measures of hourly labor compensation rose\nat an annual rate of only around 2 percent through most of the recovery. More recently,\nhowever, some tentative hints of a pickup in the pace of wage gains may indicate that the\nobjective of full employment is coming closer into view.\nRecent Inflation Developments\nWhile the labor market has moved closer to the FOMC’s mandated goal of\nmaximum employment, less progress has been made in moving inflation close to the\nFOMC’s longer-run objective of 2 percent, which the Committee considers to be\nconsistent with our mandated goal of price stability. Overall consumer price inflation has\nbeen close to zero over the past year, in large part because the big drop in crude oil prices\nsince last summer has pushed down prices for gasoline and other consumer energy\nproducts. Price inflation excluding the volatile categories of energy and food prices, or\nso-called core inflation, is often a better indicator of future overall inflation. But it too is\nrunning below our 2 percent objective and has been over most of the recovery. The\nrecent low level of core inflation--1.2 percent over the past 12 months--partly reflects the\nappreciation of the foreign exchange value of the U.S. dollar during the second half of\n\n- 8 -\nlast year, as global financial markets seemed to judge that our economy was relatively\nstronger than those of many of our trading partners. The stronger dollar has pushed down\nthe prices of imported goods, and that, in turn, has put downward pressure on core\ninflation. In addition, the plunge in oil prices may have had some indirect effects in\nholding down the prices of non-energy items in core inflation, as producers passed on to\ntheir customers some of the cost savings from lower energy prices. In all, however, these\ndownward pressures seem to be abating, and the effects of these transitory factors are\nexpected to fall out of measures of inflation by early next year.\nVery low inflation may not sound like a real problem to many people. However,\npersistently low price inflation, which can tend to slow the pace of wage increases over\ntime, can weaken the economy by, for example, making it more difficult for households\nand firms to pay off their debts. A persistent, very low inflation environment also tends\nto result in chronically low short-term interest rates. This type of situation would leave\nless scope for the FOMC to respond with its conventional monetary policy tool--namely,\na cut in the federal funds rate--to counteract a weakening in the economy.\nThe Outlook for the Economy\nLet me turn now to where I think the economy is headed over the next several\nyears. The latest estimates show that both real GDP and industrial production actually\nedged down in the first quarter of this year. Some of this weakness appears to be the\nresult of factors that I expect will be only transitory, such as the unusually harsh winter\nweather in some regions of the country and the West Coast port labor dispute that briefly\nrestrained international trade and caused disruptions in manufacturing supply chains.\nAlso, statistical noise or measurement issues may have played some role. This is not the\n\n- 9 -\nfirst time in recent years that real GDP has been reported to decline, or grow unusually\nslowly, in the first quarter of the year. There is a healthy debate among economists--\nmany within the Federal Reserve System--about some of the technical factors that may\nlie behind this pattern.4 Nevertheless, at least a couple of other more persistent factors\nalso likely weighed on economic output and industrial production in the first quarter. In\nparticular, the higher foreign exchange value of the dollar that I mentioned, as well as\nweak growth in some foreign economies, has restrained the demand for U.S. exports.\nMoreover, lower crude oil prices have significantly depressed business investment in the\ndomestic energy sector. Indeed, industrial production continued to decline somewhat in\nApril and May. We expect the drag on domestic economic activity from these factors to\nease over the course of this year, as the value of the dollar and crude oil prices stabilize,\nand I anticipate moderate economic growth, on balance, for this year as a whole. As\nalways, however, the economic outlook is uncertain. Notably, although the economic\nrecovery in the euro area appears to have gained a firmer footing, the situation in Greece\nremains unresolved.\nLooking further ahead, I think that many of the fundamental factors underlying\nU.S. economic activity are solid and should lead to some pickup in the pace of economic\n4 See Charles E. Gilbert, Norman J. Morin, Andrew D. Paciorek, and Claudia R.

In particular, I anticipate that employment will continue to\nexpand and the unemployment rate will decline further.\nAn improving job market should, in turn, help support a faster pace of household\nspending growth. Additional jobs and potentially faster wage growth bolster household\nincomes, and lower energy prices mean consumers have more money to spend on other\ngoods and services. In addition, growing employment and wages should make\nconsumers more comfortable in spending a greater portion of their incomes than they\nhave been in the aftermath of the Great Recession. Moreover, increases in house values\nand stock market prices, along with reductions in debt in recent years, have pushed up\nhouseholds’ net worth, which also should support more spending. Finally, interest rates\nfaced by borrowers remain low, reflecting the FOMC’s highly accommodative monetary\npolicies. Indeed, recent encouraging data about retail sales and light motor vehicle\npurchases in the beginning of the second quarter could be an indication that the pace of\nconsumer spending is picking up.\nAnother positive factor for the outlook is that the drag on economic growth in\nrecent years from changes in federal fiscal policies appears to have waned. Temporary\nfiscal stimulus measures supported economic output during the recession and early in the\nrecovery, but those stimulus measures have since expired, and additional policy actions\nwere taken to reduce the federal budget deficit. By 2011, these changes in fiscal policies\nwere holding back economic growth. However, the effects of those fiscal policy actions\nnow seem to be mostly behind us.5\n5 The Congressional Budget Office estimates that current federal fiscal policies will have little effect on\neconomic growth this year, but that earlier fiscal policy actions reduced the rate of real GDP growth\nroughly 1-1/2 percentage points in 2013 and about 1/4 percentage point in 2014 relative to what it would\n\n- 11 -\nThere are a couple of factors, however, that I expect could restrain economic\ngrowth. First, business owners and managers remain cautious and have not substantially\nincreased their capital expenditures despite the solid fundamentals and brighter prospects\nfor consumer spending. Businesses are holding large amounts of cash on their balance\nsheets, which may suggest that greater risk aversion is playing a role. Indeed, some\neconomic analysis suggests that uncertainty about the strength of the recovery and about\ngovernment economic policies could be contributing to the restraint in business\ninvestment.6\nA second factor that could restrain economic growth regards housing. While\nnational home prices have been rising for a few years and home sales have improved\nrecently, residential construction has remained quite soft. Many households still find it\ndifficult to obtain mortgage credit, but, more generally, the weak job market and slow\nwage gains in recent years appear to have induced people to double-up on housing. For\nexample, many young adults continue to live with their parents. Population growth is\ncreating a need for more housing, whether to rent or to own, and I do expect that\ncontinuing job and wage gains will encourage more people to form new households.\nNevertheless, activity in the housing sector seems likely to improve only gradually.\nRegarding inflation, as I mentioned earlier, the recent effects of lower prices for\ncrude oil and for imports on overall inflation are expected to wane during this year.\nCombined with further tightening in labor and product markets, I expect inflation will\nmove toward the FOMC’s 2 percent objective over the next few years. Importantly, a\nhave been otherwise. See Congressional Budget Office, The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2015 to 2025\n(Washington: CBO, January), p. 32, https://www.cbo.gov/publication/49892.\n6 A recent survey of this research is presented by Nicholas Bloom (2014), “Fluctuations in Uncertainty,”\nJournal of Economic Perspectives, vol. 28 (Spring), pp. 153-76.\n\n- 12 -\nnumber of different surveys indicate that longer-term inflation expectations have\nremained stable even as recent readings on inflation have fallen. If inflation expectations\nhad not remained stable, I would be more concerned because consumer and business\nexpectations about inflation can become self-fulfilling.\nImplications for Monetary Policy\nMy own outlook for the economy and inflation is broadly consistent with the\ncentral tendency of the projections submitted by FOMC participants at the time of our\nJune meeting. Based on my outlook, I expect that it will be appropriate at some point\nlater this year to take the first step to raise the federal funds rate and thus begin\nnormalizing monetary policy. But I want to emphasize that the course of the economy\nand inflation remains highly uncertain, and unanticipated developments could delay or\naccelerate this first step. We will be watching carefully to see if there is continued\nimprovement in labor market conditions, and we will need to be reasonably confident that\ninflation will move back to 2 percent in the next few years.\nLet me also stress that this initial increase in the federal funds rate, whenever it\noccurs, will by itself have only a very small effect on the overall level of monetary\naccommodation provided by the Federal Reserve. Because there are some factors, which\nI mentioned earlier, that continue to restrain the economic expansion, I currently\nanticipate that the appropriate pace of normalization will be gradual, and that monetary\npolicy will need to be highly supportive of economic activity for quite some time. The\nprojections of most of my FOMC colleagues indicate that they have similar expectations\nfor the likely path of the federal funds rate. But, again, both the course of the economy\nand inflation are uncertain. If progress toward our employment and inflation goals is\n\n- 13 -\nmore rapid than expected, it may be appropriate to remove monetary policy\naccommodation more quickly. However, if progress toward our goals is slower than\nanticipated, then the Committee may move more slowly in normalizing policy.\nLong-Run Economic Growth\nBefore I conclude, let me very briefly place my discussion of the economic\noutlook into a longer-term context. The Federal Reserve contributes to the nation’s\neconomic performance in part by using monetary policy to help achieve our mandated\ngoals of maximum employment and price stability. But success in promoting these\nobjectives does not, by itself, ensure a strong pace of long-run economic growth or\nsubstantial improvements in future living standards. The most important factor\ndetermining continued advances in living standards is productivity growth, defined as the\nrate of increase in how much a worker can produce in an hour of work. Over time,\nsustained increases in productivity are necessary to support rising household incomes.\nHere the recent data have been disappointing. The growth rate of output per hour\nworked in the business sector has averaged about 1-1/4 percent per year since the\nrecession began in late 2007 and has been essentially flat over the past year. In contrast,\nannual productivity gains averaged 2-3/4 percent over the decade preceding the Great\nRecession. I mentioned earlier the sluggish pace of wage gains in recent years, and while\nI do think that this is evidence of some persisting labor market slack, it also may reflect,\nat least in part, fairly weak productivity growth.\nThere are many unanswered questions about what has slowed productivity growth\nin recent years and about the prospects for productivity growth in the longer run. But we\ndo know that productivity ultimately depends on many factors, including our workforce’s\n\n- 14 -\nknowledge and skills along with the quantity and quality of the capital equipment,\ntechnology, and infrastructure that they have to work with. As a general principle, the\nAmerican people would be well served by the active pursuit of effective policies to\nsupport longer-run growth in productivity. Policies to strengthen education and training,\nto encourage entrepreneurship and innovation, and to promote capital investment, both\npublic and private, could all potentially be of great benefit in improving future living\nstandards in our nation.\nThank you, again, to the City Club for inviting me to Cleveland and for the\nopportunity to speak to you today.",

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Monetary Policy Implementation and Transmission in the Post-Crisis Period,”\na research conference sponsored by\nthe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nWashington, D.C.\nNovember 12, 2015\n\nIt is my pleasure to welcome you to the Federal Reserve Board’s conference on\n“Monetary Policy Implementation and Transmission in the Post-Crisis Period.” The\nconference aims to bring together academic and central bank economists, financial\nmarket practitioners, and policymakers to stimulate debate and research on a topic that is\ncritically important to the Federal Reserve’s mission of conducting monetary policy in\nthe pursuit of maximum employment and stable prices.\nThe global financial crisis had profound effects on our economy, and it altered the\nway many think about monetary policy. At the peak of the crisis and during its\nimmediate aftermath, unconventional monetary policy measures were designed and\nimplemented by the Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world. The post-\ncrisis period has offered policymakers an opportunity to assess a range of novel policy\nand operational issues associated with the conduct of monetary policy and the\neffectiveness of different policy options. Specifically, policymakers have to carefully\nweigh the advantages and disadvantages of alternative monetary implementation\nframeworks in the presence of new policy tools. Moreover, policymakers should be\nmindful of new channels for monetary policy transmission that may have emerged from\nthe intricate economic and financial linkages in our global economy that were revealed\nby the crisis. Finally, it is crucial to understand the effect of regulations and possible\nchanges in financial intermediation on monetary policy implementation and transmission.\nThe impressive conference program covers the following topics in three sessions:\nmonetary policy implementation, the transmission of monetary policy, and the effect of\nregulation and financial intermediation on monetary policy implementation and\ntransmission. The presentations and discussions of the 12 academic papers on the\n\n- 2 -\nconference program will surely provide a foundation for what I expect will be a\nstimulating discussion of important topics over the next two days.\nLooking ahead to later today, I am delighted that Vice Chairman Fischer will\ndeliver keynote remarks on the exchange rate mechanism in the transmission of monetary\npolicy. Tomorrow the conference concludes with two interesting policy panels on the\neffect of regulations on monetary policy and the “optimal design” of monetary policy in\nthe post-crisis world.\nLet me also say that I consider the topics covered during this conference highly\nrelevant for the Federal Reserve System’s ongoing efforts to evaluate potential long-run\nmonetary policy implementation frameworks and to assess a number of issues related to\nthe consideration of alternative frameworks. I hope the work and ideas presented and\ndiscussed over the next two days will spur subsequent research on these issues and\npromote further collaboration among all of you.\nAs I have often stressed before, in addition to its responsibilities for monetary\npolicy and financial regulation and supervision, the Federal Reserve takes very seriously\nits role as a research institution. I want to thank our research conference committee for\nputting together this high-caliber research conference, which has gathered distinguished\nspeakers and guests from around the world and, I am sure, will add to our understanding\nof the implementation and transmission of monetary policy.\nWelcome to the Federal Reserve Board. I hope you all have enjoyable and\nproductive discussions over the next two days.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n12:25 p.m. EDT\nApril 16, 2014\nMonetary Policy and the Economic Recovery\nRemarks by\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nEconomic Club of New York\nNew York, New York\nApril 16, 2014\n\nNearly five years into the expansion that began after the financial crisis and the\nGreat Recession, the recovery has come a long way. More than 8 million jobs have been\nadded to nonfarm payrolls since 2009, almost the same number lost as a result of the\nrecession. Led by a resurgent auto industry, manufacturing output has also nearly\nreturned to its pre-recession peak. While the housing market still has far to go, it seems\nto have turned a corner.\nIt is a sign of how far the economy has come that a return to full employment is,\nfor the first time since the crisis, in the medium-term outlooks of many forecasters. It is a\nreminder of how far we have to go, however, that this long-awaited outcome is projected\nto be more than two years away.\nToday I will discuss how my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) and I view the state of the economy and how this view is likely to shape our\nefforts to promote a return to maximum employment in a context of price stability. I will\nstart with the FOMC’s outlook, which foresees a gradual return over the next two to three\nyears of economic conditions consistent with its mandate.\nWhile monetary policy discussions naturally begin with a baseline outlook, the\npath of the economy is uncertain, and effective policy must respond to significant\nunexpected twists and turns the economy may take. My primary focus today will be on\nhow the FOMC’s monetary policy framework has evolved to best support the recovery\nthrough those twists and turns, and what this framework is likely to imply as the recovery\nprogresses.\n\n- 2 -\nThe Current Economic Outlook\nThe FOMC’s current outlook for continued, moderate growth is little changed\nfrom last fall. In recent months, some indicators have been notably weak, requiring us to\njudge whether the data are signaling a material change in the outlook. The unusually\nharsh winter weather in much of the nation has complicated this judgment, but my\nFOMC colleagues and I generally believe that a significant part of the recent softness was\nweather related.\nThe continued improvement in labor market conditions has been important in this\njudgment. The unemployment rate, at 6.7 percent, has fallen three-tenths of 1 percentage\npoint since late last year. Broader measures of unemployment that include workers\nmarginally attached to the labor force and those working part time for economic reasons\nhave fallen a bit more than the headline unemployment rate, and labor force participation,\nwhich had been falling, has ticked up this year.\nInflation, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures,\nhas slowed from an annual rate of about 2-1/2 percent in early 2012 to less than 1 percent\nin February of this year.1 This rate is well below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run\nobjective. Many advanced economies are observing a similar softness in inflation.\nTo some extent, the low rate of inflation seems due to influences that are likely to\nbe temporary, including a deceleration in consumer energy prices and outright declines in\ncore import prices in recent quarters. Longer-run inflation expectations have remained\nremarkably steady, however. We anticipate that, as the effects of transitory factors\nsubside and as labor market gains continue, inflation will gradually move back toward\n2 percent.\n1 These inflation rates are based on 12-month changes.\n\n- 3 -\nIn sum, the central tendency of FOMC participant projections for the\nunemployment rate at the end of 2016 is 5.2 to 5.6 percent, and for inflation the central\ntendency is 1.7 to 2 percent. 2 If this forecast was to become reality, the economy would\nbe approaching what my colleagues and I view as maximum employment and price\nstability for the first time in nearly a decade. I find this baseline outlook quite plausible.\nOf course, if the economy obediently followed our forecasts, the job of central\nbankers would be a lot easier and their speeches would be a lot shorter. Alas, the\neconomy is often not so compliant, so I will ask your indulgence for a few more minutes.\nThree Big Questions for the FOMC\nBecause the course of the economy is uncertain, monetary policymakers need to\ncarefully watch for signs that it is diverging from the baseline outlook and then respond\nin a systematic way. Let me turn first to monitoring and discuss three questions I believe\nare likely to loom large in the FOMC’s ongoing assessment of where we are on the path\nback to maximum employment and price stability.\nIs there still significant slack in the labor market?\nThe first question concerns the extent of slack in the labor market. One of the\nFOMC’s objectives is to promote a return to maximum employment, but exactly what\nconditions are consistent with maximum employment can be difficult to assess. Thus far\nin the recovery and to this day, there is little question that the economy has remained far\nfrom maximum employment, so measurement difficulties were not our focus. But as the\nattainment of our maximum employment goal draws nearer, it will be necessary for the\n2 These figures are based on the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) submitted in conjunction with\nthe March 2014 FOMC meeting. The SEP is an addendum to the FOMC minutes and is available at Board\nof Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2014), “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee,\nMarch 18-19, 2014,” press release, April 9,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140409a.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nFOMC to form a more nuanced judgment about when the recovery of the labor market\nwill be materially complete. As the FOMC’s statement on longer-term goals and policy\nstrategy emphasizes, these judgments are inherently uncertain and must be based on a\nwide range of indicators.3\nI will refer to the shortfall in employment relative to its mandate-consistent level\nas labor market slack, and there are a number of different indicators of this slack.\nProbably the best single indicator is the unemployment rate. At 6.7 percent, it is now\nslightly more than 1 percentage point above the 5.2 to 5.6 percent central tendency of the\nCommittee’s projections for the longer-run normal unemployment rate. This shortfall\nremains significant, and in our baseline outlook, it will take more than two years to\nclose.4\nOther data suggest that there may be more slack in labor markets than indicated\nby the unemployment rate. For example, the share of the workforce that is working part\ntime but would prefer to work full time remains quite high by historical standards.\nSimilarly, while the share of workers in the labor force who are unemployed and have\nbeen looking for work for more than six months has fallen from its peak in 2010, it\nremains as high as any time prior to the Great Recession.5 There is ongoing debate about\nwhy long-term unemployment remains so high and the degree to which it might decline\n3 See the FOMC’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, as amended effective\nJanuary 28, 2014, which is available on the Board’s website at\nhttp://federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf.\n4 See the SEP in Board of Governors, “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, March 18-19,\n2014,” in note 2.\n5 The share in CPS employment of persons working part time for economic reasons rose from 3 percent\nprior to the recession to 6.5 percent in November 2009, and it has since then declined only to 5\npercent. The share in the labor force of those unemployed for more than 26 weeks rose from less than 1\npercent prior to the recession to 4.5 percent, and it has since declined to just below 2.5 percent; the previous\npeak for this series was 2.5 percent in 1983. The records for long-term unemployed begin in 1948.\n\n- 5 -\nin a more robust economy. As I argued more fully in a recent speech, I believe that long-\nterm unemployment might fall appreciably if economic conditions were stronger.6\nThe low level of labor force participation may also signal additional slack that is\nnot reflected in the headline unemployment rate. Participation would be expected to fall\nbecause of the aging of the population, but the decline steepened in the recovery.\nAlthough economists differ over what share of those currently outside the labor market\nmight join or rejoin the labor force in a stronger economy, my own view is that some\nportion of the decline in participation likely represents labor market slack.7\nLastly, economists also look to wage pressures to signal a tightening labor market.\nAt present, wage gains continue to proceed at a historically slow pace in this recovery,\nwith few signs of a broad-based acceleration. As the extent of slack we see today\ndiminishes, however, the FOMC will need to monitor these and other labor market\nindicators closely to judge how much slack remains and, therefore, how accommodative\nmonetary policy should be.\nIs inflation moving back toward 2 percent?\nA second question that is likely to figure heavily in our assessment of the\nrecovery is whether inflation is moving back toward the FOMC’s 2 percent longer-run\nobjective, as envisioned in our baseline outlook. As the most recent FOMC statement\n6 See Janet L. Yellen (2014), “What the Federal Reserve Is Doing to Promote a Stronger Job Market,”\nspeech delivered at the 2014 National Interagency Community Reinvestment Conference, Chicago, March\n31, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20140331a.htm.\n7 For the view that most of the recent decline in labor force participation reflects retirement, see Shigeru\nFujita (2014), “On the Causes of Declines in the Labor Force Participation Rate,” Federal Reserve Bank of\nPhiladelphia, special report, Research Rap, February 6, available at www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-\ndata/publications/research-rap. The view that a larger share of the recent decline reflects cyclical factors is\nexpressed by Christopher J. Erceg and Andrew T. Levin (2013), “Labor Force Participation and Monetary\nPolicy in the Wake of the Great Recession,” paper presented at “Fulfilling the Full Employment Mandate--\nMonetary Policy and the Labor Market,” 57th Economic Conference of the Federal Reserve Bank of\nBoston, April 12, available at www.bostonfed.org/employment2013/agenda.htm.\n\n- 6 -\nemphasizes, inflation persistently below 2 percent could pose risks to economic\nperformance.\nThe FOMC strives to avoid inflation slipping too far below its 2 percent objective\nbecause, at very low inflation rates, adverse economic developments could more easily\npush the economy into deflation. The limited historical experience with deflation shows\nthat, once it starts, deflation can become entrenched and associated with prolonged\nperiods of very weak economic performance.8\nA persistent bout of very low inflation carries other risks as well. With the federal\nfunds rate currently near its lower limit, lower inflation translates into a higher real value\nfor the federal funds rate, limiting the capacity of monetary policy to support the\neconomy.9 Further, with longer-term inflation expectations anchored near 2 percent in\nrecent years, persistent inflation well below this expected value increases the real burden\nof debt for households and firms, which may put a drag on economic activity.\nI will mention two considerations that will be important in assessing whether\ninflation is likely to move back to 2 percent as the economy recovers. First, we anticipate\nthat, as labor market slack diminishes, it will exert less of a drag on inflation. However,\nduring the recovery, very high levels of slack have seemingly not generated strong\ndownward pressure on inflation. We must therefore watch carefully to see whether\n8 See Ben S. Bernanke (2002), “Deflation: Making Sure ‘It’ Doesn’t Happen Here,” speech delivered at the\nNational Economists Club, Washington, November 21,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2002/20021121/default.htm.\n9 If firms’ and households’ spending decisions depended only on longer-term interest rates, temporarily\nhigher short-term real interest rates due to low inflation at a time that nominal interest rates are constrained\nby the zero lower bound would have little economic effects, provided that these higher short-term real\ninterest rates would be expected to be compensated by lower short-term real interest rates later on.\nHowever, to the extent that these spending decisions depend in part on shorter-term real interest rates, low\ninflation can induce meaningful economic costs.\n\n- 7 -\ndiminishing slack is helping return inflation to our objective.10 Second, our baseline\nprojection rests on the view that inflation expectations will remain well anchored near 2\npercent and provide a natural pull back to that level. But the strength of that pull in the\nunprecedented conditions we continue to face is something we must continue to assess.\nFinally, the FOMC is well aware that inflation could also threaten to rise\nsubstantially above 2 percent. At present, I rate the chances of this happening as\nsignificantly below the chances of inflation persisting below 2 percent, but we must\nalways be prepared to respond to such unexpected outcomes, which leads us to my third\nquestion.\nWhat factors may push the recovery off track?\nMyriad factors continuously buffet the economy, so the Committee must always\nbe asking, “What factors may be pushing the recovery off track?” For example, over the\nnearly 5 years of the recovery, the economy has been affected by greater-than-expected\nfiscal drag in the United States and by spillovers from the sovereign debt and banking\nproblems of some euro-area countries. Further, our baseline outlook has changed as we\nhave learned about the degree of structural damage to the economy wrought by the crisis\nand the subsequent pace of healing.\nLet me offer an example of how these issues shape policy. Four years ago, in\nApril 2010, the outlook appeared fairly bright. The emergency lending programs that the\n10 The uncertainty surrounding the empirical relationship between slack and inflation is discussed in\nJames H. Stock and Mark W.

Olivei, eds., Understanding Inflation and the\nImplications for Monetary Policy: A Phillips Curve Retrospective (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press).\nMoreover, with the share of long-term unemployed in total unemployment unusually elevated in recent\nyears, there is an ongoing discussion about whether short- and long-term unemployment have differential\neffects on inflation. See Robert J. Gordon (2013), “The Phillips Curve Is Alive and Well: Inflation and the\nNAIRU during the Slow Recovery,” NBER Working Paper Series 19390 (Cambridge, Mass.: National\nBureau of Economic Research, August), available at www.nber.org/papers/w19390; and Mark W. Watson\n(forthcoming), “Inflation Persistence, the NAIRU, and the Great Recession,” American Economic Review.\n\n- 8 -\nFederal Reserve implemented at the height of the crisis had been largely wound down,\nand the Fed was soon to complete its first large-scale asset purchase program. Private-\nsector forecasters polled in the April 2010 Blue Chip survey were predicting that the\nunemployment rate would fall steadily to 8.6 percent in the final quarter of 2011.11\nThis forecast proved quite accurate--the unemployment rate averaged 8.6 percent\nin the fourth quarter of 2011. But this was not the whole story. In April 2010, Blue Chip\nforecasters not only expected falling unemployment, they also expected the FOMC to\nsoon begin raising the federal funds rate. Indeed, they expected the federal funds rate to\nreach 1.3 percent by the second quarter of 2011.12 By July 2010, however, with growth\ndisappointing and the FOMC expressing concerns about softening in both growth and\ninflation, the Blue Chip forecast of the federal funds rate in mid-2011 had fallen to\n0.8 percent, and by October the forecasters expected that the rate would remain in the\nrange of 0 to 25 basis points throughout 2011, as turned out to be the case.13 Not only\ndid expectations of policy tightening recede, the FOMC also initiated a new $600 billion\nasset purchase program in November 2010.\n11 See Aspen Publishers (2010), Blue Chip Economic Indicators, vol. 35, no. 4 (April 10). These forecasts\nwere similar to the central tendency of FOMC participants’ projections for the unemployment rate at the\nend of 2011 submitted in conjunction with the April 2010 FOMC meeting, which ranged from 8.1 to\n8.5 percent. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2010), “Minutes of the Federal Open\nMarket Committee, April 27-28, 2010,” press release, May 19,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20100519a.htm.\n12 See Aspen Publishers (2010), Blue Chip Financial Forecasts, vol. 29, no. 4 (April 1).\n13 See, respectively, Aspen Publishers (2010), Blue Chip Financial Forecasts, vol. 29, no. 7 (July 1); and\nAspen Publishers (2010), vol. 29, no. 10 (October 1). In the statement following its August 10, 2010,\nmeeting, the FOMC noted that “the pace of recovery in output and employment has slowed in recent\nmonths.” See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2010), “FOMC Statement,” press\nrelease, August 10, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20100810a.htm.

In April 2011, Blue\nChip forecasters expected the unemployment rate to fall to 7.9 percent by the fourth\nquarter of 2012, with the FOMC expected to have already raised the federal funds rate to\nnear 1 percent by mid-2012.14\nAs it turned out, the unemployment rate forecast was once more remarkably\naccurate, but again this was associated with considerably more accommodation than\nanticipated. In response to signs of slowing economic activity, in August 2011 the\nFOMC for the first time expressed its forward guidance in terms of the calendar, stating\nthat conditions would likely warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at\nleast through mid-2013. The following month, the Committee added to accommodation\nby adopting a new balance sheet policy known as the maturity extension program. 15\nThus, in both 2011 and 2012, the unemployment rate actually declined by about\nas much as had been forecast the previous year, but only after unexpected weakness\nprompted additional accommodative steps by the Federal Reserve. In both cases, I\nbelieve that the FOMC’s decision to respond to signs of weakness with significant\nadditional accommodation played an important role in helping to keep the projected labor\n14 See, respectively, Aspen Publishers (2011), Blue Chip Economic Indicators, vol. 36, no. 4 (April 10);\nand Aspen Publishers (2011), Blue Chip Financial Forecasts, vol. 30, no. 4 (April 1).\n15 For the FOMC’s calendar-based forward guidance as communicated in its August 2011 statement, see\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2011), “FOMC Statement,” press release, August 9,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20110809a.htm.

Now I will turn from the task of monitoring to the policy\nresponse.\nPolicy Challenges in an Unprecedented Recovery\nFundamental to modern thinking on central banking is the idea that monetary\npolicy is more effective when the public better understands and anticipates how the\ncentral bank will respond to evolving economic conditions. Specifically, it is important\nfor the central bank to make clear how it will adjust its policy stance in response to\nunforeseen economic developments in a manner that reduces or blunts potentially\nharmful consequences. If the public understands and expects policymakers to behave in\nthis systematically stabilizing manner, it will tend to respond less to such developments.\nMonetary policy will thus have an “automatic stabilizer” effect that operates through\nprivate-sector expectations. It is important to note that tying the response of policy to the\neconomy necessarily makes the future course of the federal funds rate uncertain. But by\nresponding to changing circumstances, policy can be most effective at reducing\nuncertainty about the course of inflation and employment.\nRecall how this worked during the couple of decades before the crisis--a period\nsometimes known as the Great Moderation. The FOMC’s main policy tool, the federal\nfunds rate, was well above zero, leaving ample scope to respond to the modest shocks\n16 There are a range of estimates on the effectiveness of these policies. A review is provided in Ben S.\nBernanke (2012), “Monetary Policy since the Onset of the Crisis,” speech delivered at “The Changing\nPolicy Landscape,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson\nHole, Wyo., August 30-September 1,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20120831a.htm.\n\n- 11 -\nthat buffeted the economy during that period. Many studies confirmed that the\nappropriate response of policy to those shocks could be described with a fair degree of\naccuracy by a simple rule linking the federal funds rate to the shortfall or excess of\nemployment and inflation relative to their desired values.17 The famous Taylor rule\nprovides one such formula.18\nThe idea that monetary policy should react in a systematic manner in order to\nblunt the effects of shocks has remained central in the FOMC’s policymaking during this\nrecovery. However, the application of this idea has been more challenging. With the\nfederal funds rate pinned near zero, the FOMC has been forced to rely on two less\nfamiliar policy tools--the first one being forward guidance regarding the future setting of\nthe federal funds rate and the second being large-scale asset purchases. There are no\ntime-tested guidelines for how these tools should be adjusted in response to changes in\nthe outlook. As the episodes recounted earlier illustrate, the FOMC has continued to try\nto adjust its policy tools in a systematic manner in response to new information about the\neconomy. But because both the tools and the economic conditions have been unfamiliar,\nit has also been critical that the FOMC communicate how it expects to deploy its tools in\nresponse to material changes in the outlook.\nLet me review some important elements in the evolution of the FOMC’s\ncommunication framework. When the FOMC initially began using its unconventional\ntools, policy communication was relatively simple. In December 2008, for example, the\n17 See the discussion in John B. Taylor and John C. Williams (2011), “Simple and Robust Rules for\nMonetary Policy,” chap. 15 in Benjamin M. Friedman and Michael Woodford, eds., Handbook of Monetary\nEconomics, vol. 3B (San Diego: North-Holland), pp. 829-59.

The European Central Bank\nrecently linked its forward guidance more explicitly to its assessment of economic slack, as discussed in\nPresident Mario Draghi’s press conference on March 6, 2014; see Mario Draghi (2014), “Introductory\nStatement to the Press Conference (with Q&A),” European Central Bank, Frankfurt, March 6,\nwww.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2014/html/is140306.en.html.\n\n- 13 -\npercentage point above the Committee’s objective, and longer-term inflation expectations\ncontinued to be well anchored. This guidance emphasized to the public that it could\ncount on a near-zero federal funds rate at least until substantial progress in the recovery\nhad been achieved, however long that might take. When these thresholds were\nannounced, the unemployment rate was reported to be 7.7 percent, and the Committee\nprojected that the 6-1/2 percent threshold would not be reached for another 2-1/2 years--\nin mid-2015. The Committee emphasized that these numerical criteria were not triggers\nfor raising the federal funds rate, and Chairman Bernanke stated that, ultimately, any\ndecision to begin removing accommodation would be based on a wide range of\nindicators.21\nOur communications about asset purchases have undergone a similar\ntransformation. The initial asset purchase programs had fixed time and quantity limits,\nalthough those limits came with a proviso that they might be adjusted. In the fall of\n2012, the FOMC launched its current purchase program, this time explicitly tying the\ncourse of the program to evolving economic conditions. When the program began, the\nrate of purchases was $85 billion per month, and the Committee indicated that purchases\nwould continue, providing that inflation remained well behaved, until there was a\nsubstantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.22\nBased on the cumulative progress toward maximum employment since the\ninitiation of the program and the improvement in the outlook for the labor market, the\nFOMC began reducing the pace of asset purchases last December, stating that “[i]f\n21 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012), “Transcript of Chairman Bernanke’s\nPress Conference, December 12, 2012,”\nwww.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20121212.pdf.\n22 See Board of Governors, “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,” September 13, 2012, in note 19.\n\n- 14 -\nincoming information broadly supports the Committee’s expectation of ongoing\nimprovement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-\nterm objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further\nmeasured steps at future meetings.”23 Purchases are currently proceeding at a pace of\n$55 billion per month. Consistent with my theme today, however, the FOMC statement\nunderscores that purchases are not on a preset course--the FOMC stands ready to adjust\nthe pace of purchases as warranted should the outlook change materially.\nRecent Changes to the Forward Guidance\nAt our most recent meeting in March, the FOMC reformulated its forward\nguidance for the federal funds rate. While one of the main motivations for this change\nwas that the unemployment rate might soon cross the 6-1/2 percent threshold, the new\nformulation is also well suited to help the FOMC explain policy adjustments that may\narise in response to changes in the outlook. I should note that the change in the forward\nguidance did not indicate a change in the Committee’s policy intentions, but instead was\nmade to clarify the Committee’s thinking about policy as the economy continues to\nrecover. The new guidance provides a general description of the framework that the\nFOMC will apply in making decisions about the timing of liftoff. Specifically, in\ndetermining how long to maintain the current target range of 0 to 25 basis points for the\nfederal funds rate, “the Committee will assess progress, both realized and expected,\ntoward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.”24 In other\nwords, the larger the shortfall of employment or inflation from their respective objectives,\n23 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2013), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC\nStatement,” press release, December 18,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20131218a.htm.\n24 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2014), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC\nStatement,” press release, March 19, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140319a.htm.\n\n- 15 -\nand the slower the projected progress toward those objectives, the longer the current\ntarget range for the federal funds rate is likely to be maintained. This approach\nunderscores the continuing commitment of the FOMC to maintain the appropriate degree\nof accommodation to support the recovery. The new guidance also reaffirms the\nFOMC’s view that decisions about liftoff should not be based on any one indicator, but\nthat it will take into account a wide range of information on the labor market, inflation,\nand financial developments.\nAlong with this general framework, the FOMC provided an assessment of what\nthat framework implies for the likely path of policy under the baseline outlook. At\npresent, the Committee anticipates that economic and financial conditions will likely\nwarrant maintaining the current range “for the federal funds rate for a considerable time\nafter the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run\nbelow the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation\nexpectations remain well anchored.”25\nFinally, the Committee began explaining more fully how policy may operate in\nthe period after liftoff, indicating its expectation that economic conditions may, for some\ntime, warrant keeping short-term interest rates below levels the Committee views as\nlikely to prove normal in the longer run. FOMC participants have cited different reasons\nfor this view, but many of the reasons involve persistent effects of the financial crisis and\nthe possibility that the productive capacity of the economy will grow more slowly, at\nleast for a time, than it did, on average, before the crisis. The expectation that the\nachievement of our economic objectives will likely require low real interest rates for\nsome time is again not confined to the United States but is shared broadly across many\n25 See Board of Governors, “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,” March 19, 2014, in note 24.\n\n- 16 -\nadvanced economies.26 Of course, this guidance is a forecast and will evolve as we gain\nfurther evidence about how the economy is operating in the wake of the crisis and\nensuing recession.\nConclusion\nIn summary, the policy framework I have described reflects the FOMC’s\ncommitment to systematically respond to unforeseen economic developments in order to\npromote a return to maximum employment in a context of price stability.\nIt is very welcome news that a return to these conditions has finally appeared in\nthe medium-term outlook of many forecasters. But it will be much better news when this\nobjective is reached. My colleagues on the FOMC and I will stay focused on doing the\nFederal Reserve’s part to promote this goal.\n26 See the discussion in International Monetary Fund (2014), “Perspectives on Global Real Interest Rates,”\nchap. 3 in World Economic Outlook: Recovery Strengthens, Remains Uneven (Washington: IMF, April),\nwww.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2014/01/pdf/c3.pdf.",

    "text": "Speech to the San Francisco Planning and Urban Research Group\nSan Francisco, California\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery February 12, 2008, 8:05 AM Pacific, 11:05 AM Eastern\nProspects for the U.S. Economy in 2008\nGood morning, and thank you very much for inviting me to speak to you today. I\nwas very pleased that things worked out for us to get together here at the San Francisco\nFed, and I want you to know that we’re delighted to have you. I’d also like to say a word\nof appreciation for all the support this event has received from the people at Shorenstein.\nIt is yet another example of the company’s engagement in and commitment to San\nFrancisco and to the Bay Area.\nToday I’d like to talk about developments in the economy and in monetary policy,\ntwo items that have definitely been making the news lately. On January 22, the Federal\nOpen Market Committee cut its main policy rate—the federal funds rate—by three-\nquarters of a percentage point. Then, on January 30, at the scheduled meeting, the\nCommittee voted to cut the policy rate again, this time by half a percentage point to 3\npercent. Taking these actions together with those that began last September, the\nCommittee has cut that rate by a total of 2¼ percentage points.\nThe purpose of these actions is to stimulate demand in the face of the combined\nimpact of the severe contraction in housing and the related financial market disruptions.\nWhile housing construction has been weak for more than two years, its effects did not\nspill over to most other sectors until fairly recently. That’s why we used to talk about a\n“dual economy,” with housing notably weak, but other sectors doing well. However,\nfinancial markets became disrupted in the middle of last year, which has not only\n1\n\nintensified the housing slump, but also has tightened credit conditions for some\nhouseholds and businesses. The combined impact has led to slowing more broadly\nthrough the economy. It is this broader slowdown that has elicited Federal Reserve\nactions in recent months.\nIn my remarks today, I plan to discuss my views on policy and on the prospects\nfor the nation’s economy this year and beyond.\nFinancial markets\nI’d like to begin with a discussion of the disruptions in U.S. and global financial\nmarkets, because they influence not only the economy’s most likely course but also the\nrisks that could alter that course. In my view, these disruptions are likely to continue for\nsome time. In other words, I think they have laid bare some fundamental issues with the\nstructure of the financial system that will require significant adjustments.\nThe financial disruptions are centered in the markets for asset-backed securities.\nThe aim of such instruments is to diversify and spread risk, potentially enhancing\neconomic welfare by broadening access to credit and lowering its cost. These\ninstruments have been around a long time. For example, for many years, when a bank\noriginated a mortgage, instead of holding it on its books, it may have sold the mortgage to\none of the government-sponsored agencies, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. The agencies,\nin turn, would then bundle that mortgage with other similar mortgages into a security.\nThe virtue of this mortgage-backed security is its liquidity—that is, it can be traded in\nfinancial markets. Since around 2003, private investment banks and commercial banks\nhave increasingly been involved in securitizing mortgages and other assets as well. This\n2\n\nbusiness has grown dramatically, securitizing many types of underlying loans and,\nimportantly, about 75 percent of all subprime mortgages in 2006.\nAdvances in financial engineering have led to new and complex forms of asset-\nbacked securities. For example, CDOs, or collateralized debt obligations, package\nmultiple mortgage-backed securities—essentially securitizing several already securitized\nbundles of long-term debt instruments. Typically, they include tranches—literally,\n“slices”—of mortgage-backed securities with different exposures to risk based on a\nprioritization of the payments from the underlying mortgage securities, and are a type of\n“structured credit.” There are even instruments, known as CDO-squared, that consist of\ntranches based on holdings of other CDOs, rather than “simple” mortgage-backed\nsecurities, and CDO-cubed that, as you might now guess, consist of tranches based on\nholdings of CDO-squared.\nTo deal with the complexity of these instruments, many market participants,\nincluding financial institutions and other sophisticated investors, relied to a great extent\non credit rating agencies for assessments of the risk. However, last summer, to the\nsurprise of many, the rating agencies announced a set of substantial downgradings of\nhighly rated tranches of a number of subprime mortgage-backed securities in light of\nrapidly rising delinquencies in some types of those mortgages. These downgrades raised\nconcerns not only about mortgage-backed securities themselves, but also about the\nquality of rating agencies’ evaluations of risk in other structured credits. As a result,\ninvestors grew wary, as they had trouble knowing what risks were embedded in these\ninstruments, how to price the risks, and who would ultimately bear the risks. The\n3\n\nconsequence is that the markets for many such assets are now highly illiquid and all but\nclosed for new business.\nWith the benefit of hindsight, it is now apparent that underwriting standards\nslipped substantially in the United States as house prices soared. For example,\npermissible combined loan-to-value ratios edged up during 2005 and 2006. And no- or\nlow-documentation loans—so-called “stated income” loans—became more prevalent.\nSuch loans might have performed reasonably well if house prices had continued to rise,\nbut once house prices leveled off and then began to decline, the stage was set for trouble.\nThe financial turmoil has spread beyond the mortgage market in part because\nstructured credits have been based on a wide variety of underlying loans, such as business\nloans, including the loans used to finance the recent wave of leveraged buyouts, or LBOs,\ncommercial real estate, student loans, credit card loans, and subprime mortgages, to name\na few.\nThe bottom line is that, in recent years, the financial system has gone through a\nsignificant restructuring that made evaluating and pricing risk difficult. The\nreverberations of the resulting financial disruption are still with us. I’d like to describe\nsome of them now.\nAs investors have sought to shun risk, there has been a worldwide “flight to\nsafety,” leading to a strong demand to hold U.S. Treasury securities—the safest and most\nliquid instruments in the world. This demand has contributed to a sharp decline in\ninterest rates on Treasuries. Of course, these rates also have declined because of the\nCommittee’s moves to ease policy.\n4\n\nHowever, the potential stimulatory effects of this drop in risk-free Treasury rates\nhave been offset in many cases by another key feature of the financial turmoil, namely, a\nsharp rise in interest rate risk spreads, as riskier borrowers have had to pay higher\npremiums to compensate lenders for a perceived increase in the probability of default or\nlosses in that event. On the corporate side, prime borrowers have actually experienced\nsome net decline in interest rates since the shock first hit—that is, even though risk\nspreads are higher, they have been more than offset by lower Treasury rates. However,\nissuers of low-grade corporate bonds with greater credit risk, in contrast, face notably\nhigher interest rates.\nThe mortgage market has been the epicenter of the shock, and, not surprisingly,\ngreater aversion to risk has been particularly apparent there, with spreads above\nTreasuries increasing for mortgages of all types. Although borrowing rates for low-risk\nconforming mortgages are now lower than they were before the financial shock hit, fixed\nrates on jumbo mortgages are higher on net. Subprime mortgages remain difficult to get\nat any rate. Moreover, many markets for securitized assets, especially non-agency\nmortgage-backed securities, continue to experience severe illiquidity; in other words, the\nmarkets are not functioning efficiently, or may not be functioning much at all.\n5\n\nThe turmoil is reverberating in depository institutions as well.1 One problem is\nan unanticipated buildup of mortgages as well as LBO-related loans on their balance\nsheets. These loans were in the pipeline for securitization but could not be sold. This\nproblem has hit banks in part because they themselves were involved in creating\nstructured credits that held mortgages and the leveraged loans that they had originated.\nIn addition, they face problems with some structured investment vehicles, or SIVs, that\nthey had sponsored and backstopped to hold and fund portfolios of securitized assets\nthrough the issuance of asset-backed commercial paper. When the SIVs were in danger\nof failing, the banks were concerned about reputational effects and decided to rescue\nthem by taking the underlying assets back onto their own balance sheets. Furthermore, as\ninvestors have pulled back from the markets for asset-backed securities, the value of\nthese securities and CDOs has fallen dramatically, so banks and other financial\ninstitutions have had to write down their values, which has shrunk their capital and driven\ntheir stock prices down. Another problem for bank balance sheets is that credit losses\nhave been edging up.\nThe latest reverberation involves monoline financial guarantors. These\ncompanies guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest due on various types of\n1 In recent months, and particularly toward year-end, strains were evident in the term interbank funding\nmarkets; in these markets, banks borrow from and lend to each other, with loans maturing in a number of\nweeks, months, or even a year. The problem has been that banks that would normally lend their excess\nfunds to other banks that need them became reluctant to do so. This may reflect banks’ recognition of the\nneed to preserve liquidity to meet unexpected credit demands, greater uncertainty about the\ncreditworthiness of counterparties and concerns relating to capital positions, on top of typical, year-end\nbalance sheet considerations. A heightened focus on liquidity is logical when the markets for securitized\nassets held by banks have become highly illiquid and when the potential exists for some customers—such\nas struggling mortgage companies and others—to draw on unsecured credit lines. These markets have\nimproved since the end of last year, perhaps in part because of the Fed’s introduction of the Term Auction\nFacility, which gives banks another route besides the discount window to tap into the Fed’s lending\nfunction. (Banks had not used the discount window very much despite their need for liquidity because they\nwere concerned that doing so might erroneously signal to other financial institutions that they were in bad\nstraits. The plan for the TFA, which the Fed created in cooperation with the European Central Bank and the\nNational Bank of Switzerland, was announced on December 12.)\n6\n\nsecurities, including structured credits. The guarantees can increase the credit rating of\nthe covered securities and thus increase the value of those securities on banks’ balance\nsheets. The problem today is that the guarantors are reporting sizable losses because of\nthe increased riskiness of the securities they are covering. Those losses can affect the\nguarantors’ capital positions and even their own credit ratings. A rating downgrade of a\nguarantor reduces the value of its credit enhancements and lowers the price of the\ncovered securities. Holders of those securities such as banks then have to take write-\ndowns to reflect the lower value of the securities.\nFortunately, the banking system entered this difficult period in a strong position.\nMost institutions were extremely well capitalized. However, the combination of\nunanticipated growth in assets and in write-downs has put increased pressure on banks’\ncapital positions. Given their concerns about capital adequacy and their increased\ncaution in managing liquidity, it is not surprising that they are tightening credit terms and\nrestricting availability. At first, the focus was mostly on mortgages, but now it has spread\nto other kinds of loans, including home equity lines of credit, credit cards, and other\nconsumer credit, as well as business loans. The tightening of credit is also a response to a\nnow noticeable deterioration in credit quality, particularly for subprime mortgages; the\nlosses in other parts of the consumer loan portfolio remain at relatively low levels from\nan historical perspective, but they, too, have edged up.\nFinally, equity markets have hardly been immune to recent financial turbulence.\nBroad U.S. equity indices have been very volatile, and, on the whole, have declined since\nAugust, representing a restraint on spending. More recently, some of these declines have\n7\n\noccurred as profits have come in below market expectations for some financial firms due\nto write-downs of the value of mortgage-backed securities.\nMy overall assessment is that the turbulence in financial markets is due to some\nfundamental problems that are not likely to be resolved quickly. The effects of these\nproblems have now made credit conditions tighter throughout most of the economy’s\nprivate sector, and this will restrain spending going forward. The impact hit economic\nactivity mainly in the fourth quarter, and so far, it has been starkly negative. After robust\nperformance in the second and third quarters of last year, growth slowed significantly in\nthe fourth quarter—to a pace of only ½ percent. This brings me to the outlook for the\neconomy.\nEconomic outlook\nCurrent indicators point to continued anemic growth for at least the first half of\nthis year as well as significant downside risks even to those weak expectations. As I\nmentioned at the outset, though the prolonged slump in housing construction did not spill\nover significantly to the rest of the economy during 2006 and much of 2007, when\ncombined with the recent financial market turmoil, it has been central to the emergence\nof today’s slow-growth environment. And the course of its resolution will be a key factor\nin the economic outlook.\nForward-looking indicators of housing activity strongly suggest that the\ndownward cycle may be with us a while longer. Housing permits and sales are dropping,\nand inventories of unsold homes are at very high levels. Those inventories could rise\neven higher as foreclosures continue to mount. I’m not referring only to foreclosures on\n8\n\nsubprime adjustable-rate mortgages, which, as we all know, have increased sharply over\nthe past couple of years. More recently, we’ve begun to see increases in foreclosures on\nsubprime fixed-rate mortgages and even on prime adjustable-rate mortgages.\nWithin this Federal Reserve District, housing has been harder hit in some areas\nthan in others. For example, builders and homeowners in parts of Arizona, Nevada, and\nthe inland regions of California have seen some of the worst of the downturn, watching\nprices fall and equity evaporate as homes sit unsold for extended periods.\nThe Bay Area has not been totally immune to these developments. By the end of\n2007, existing home sales were down about 35 to 40 percent from the previous year,\nreaching their lowest level in at least two decades. Some cities and towns in the eastern\npart of this region were more exposed than others to subprime mortgages, and they\nexperienced a sharp increase in mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures last year. Here\nin San Francisco and other parts of the Bay Area, where house prices routinely exceed\nhalf a million dollars, those in the housing market have run into a problem I already\nmentioned, namely, relatively high rates on jumbo mortgages. Despite the subprime and\njumbo mortgage challenges, home prices were largely stable in the Bay Area during the\nfirst three quarters of 2007. It remains to be seen, of course, how they will do as further\nmarket adjustments occur.\nOn the national level, housing construction probably will continue to contract\nthrough the end of this year. It is true that the residential construction sector is a fairly\nsmall piece of the overall economy and is unlikely to cause significant overall weakness\nin and of itself. But the fallout from the housing cycle has many dimensions, and in the\nfourth quarter there were signs of spillovers to other sectors of the economy, most\n9\n\nworrisomely, to consumer spending. This sector is a huge part of the economy—about\n70 percent—and its growth slowed to a rate that is somewhat below its long-run trend in\nthe face of spillovers from the housing market and rising energy and food prices.\nLooking ahead, developments related to housing are likely to continue to put a\nstrain on consumers. For example, house prices have fallen noticeably and the declines\nhave intensified. Moreover, futures markets for house prices indicate further—and even\nlarger—declines in a number of metropolitan areas this year.\nWith house prices falling, homeowners’ total wealth is declining, and that could\nlead to a pullback in spending. At the same time, the fall in house prices may constrain\nconsumer spending by lowering the value of mortgage equity; less equity reduces the\nquantity of funds available for credit-constrained consumers to borrow through home\nequity loans or to withdraw through refinancing.\nIndeed, it would not be surprising to see even more moderation over the next year\nor so, as consumers face additional constraints due to the declines in the stock market, the\ntightening of lending terms at depository institutions, and the lagged effects of previous\nincreases in energy prices. National surveys show that consumer confidence has\nplummeted. And I have been hearing comments and stories from my business contacts in\nthe retail industry that are also downbeat. The rise in delinquency rates across the\nspectrum of consumer loans is strongly indicative of the growing strains on households.\nFinally, another negative factor for consumption is that labor markets have\nsoftened. In recent months, growth in employment from a survey of business\nestablishments slowed sharply, actually falling in January, and many other indicators\npoint in the same direction. Slower job growth will have a negative impact on the\n10\n\ndisposable income available to households and therefore will provide an additional\nrestraint on consumer spending.\nWith the domestic consumer likely to be pretty hobbled, it is tempting to look at\nconsumers beyond our own borders to be a source of strength for economic activity.\nForeign real GDP has advanced robustly over the past three years. With the dollar falling\nwell below its level of a year ago, U.S. exports have done very well; partly for this\nreason, U.S. net exports—exports minus imports—which consistently held growth down\nfrom 2000 to 2005, actually gave it a lift over the past couple of years. I expect net\nexports to remain a source of strength. But some countries—especially in Europe—are\nexperiencing direct negative impacts from the ongoing turmoil in financial markets.\nOthers are likely to suffer indirect impacts from any slowdown in the U.S. A slowdown\nhere could well produce ripple effects lowering growth there through trade linkages, and\nrecently this factor has been reinforced by a worldwide drop in stock prices.\nEconomic policies are another important factor in gauging the economic outlook.\nAs I have noted, the FOMC has eased the stance of monetary policy substantially in the\npast five months. Moreover, Congress has now passed a fiscal stimulus package to help\nthe economy and it could provide notable stimulus in the latter half of this year.\nEven with such policy stimulus, the overall economy is still likely to turn in a\nvery sluggish performance this year, expanding by a rate well below potential and\ncreating more slack in labor markets. At 4.9 percent, the unemployment rate is already\nslightly above my estimate of its sustainable level. Slow growth this year would most\nlikely push unemployment even higher.\n11\n\nTo sum it up, for the next few quarters, I see economic activity as weighed down\nby the housing slump and the negative factors now impacting consumer spending. It\nremains particularly vulnerable to the continuing turmoil in financial markets. My\ncomments haven’t even touched on possible slowdowns in business investment in\nequipment and software and buildings. I see the growth risks as skewed to the downside\nfor the near term. In circumstances like these, we can’t rule out the possibility of getting\ninto an adverse feedback loop—that is, the slowing economy weakens financial markets,\nwhich induces greater caution by lenders, households, and firms, and which feeds back to\neven more weakness in economic activity and more caution. Indeed, an important\nobjective of Fed policy is to mitigate the possibility that such a negative feedback loop\ncould develop and take hold.\nNow let me turn to inflation. The recent news has been disappointing. Over the\npast three months, the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and\nenergy, or the core PCE price index—one of the key measures included in the FOMC’s\nquarterly forecasts—has increased by 2.7 percent, bringing the increase over the past\ntwelve months to 2.2 percent. This rate is somewhat above what I consider to be price\nstability.\nI expect core inflation to moderate over the next few years, edging down to\naround 1¾ percent under appropriate monetary policy. Such an outcome is broadly\nconsistent with my interpretation of the Fed’s price stability mandate. Moreover, I\nbelieve the risks on the upside and downside are roughly balanced. First, it appears that\ncore inflation has been pushed up somewhat by the pass-through of higher energy and\nfood prices and by the drop in the dollar. However, recently, energy prices have turned\n12\n\ndown in response to concerns that a slowdown in the U.S. will weaken economic growth\naround the world, and thereby lower the demand for energy.\nAnother factor that could restrain inflationary pressures is the slowdown in the\nU.S. economy. This can be expected to create more slack in labor and goods markets, a\ndevelopment that typically has been associated with reduced inflation in the past.\nA key factor for inflation going forward is inflation expectations. These appear to\nhave become well-anchored over the past decade or so as the Fed’s inflation resolve has\ngained credibility. Very recently, far-dated inflation compensation—a measure derived\nfrom various Treasury yields—has risen, but it’s not clear whether this rise is due to\nhigher inflation expectations or to changes in the liquidity of those Treasury instruments\nor inflation risk. Going forward, we will need to monitor inflation expectations carefully\nto ensure that they do indeed remain well anchored.\nMonetary policy\nNow let me turn to monetary policy. The federal funds rate has been cut by 2¼\npercentage points since September and now stands at 3 percent. With near-term expected\ninflation of just above 2 percent, the real—inflation adjusted—funds rate is around 1\npercent or slightly lower, which represents an accommodative posture.\nI believe that accommodation is appropriate because the financial shock and the\nhousing cycle have significantly restrained economic growth. While growth seems likely\nto be sluggish this year, the Fed’s policy actions should help to promote a pickup in\ngrowth over time. I consider it most probable that the U.S. economy will experience\n13\n\nslow growth, and not outright recession, in coming quarters. At the same time, core\nconsumer inflation seems likely to decline gradually to somewhat below 2 percent over\nthe next couple of years, a level that is consistent with price stability.\nHowever, economic prospects are unusually uncertain. And downside risks to\neconomic growth remain. This implies that, going forward, the Committee must\ncarefully monitor and assess the effects of ongoing financial and economic developments\non the outlook and be prepared to act in a timely manner to address developments that\nalter the forecast or the risks to it.\nNow, I’d be glad to take your questions.\n# # #\n14",

    "text": "Speech to the University of California San Diego Economics Roundtable\nSan Diego, California\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery Monday, July 7, 2008, 8:00 AM Pacific, 11:00 AM Eastern\nRisks and Prospects for the U.S. Economy1\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for inviting me to meet with you. The\ntopic of my talk today is the nation’s economic outlook. I recently returned from a\nmeeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, where we voted to leave our policy\ntarget, the federal funds rate, unchanged for the time being. The discussion around the\ntable focused on three developments that for some time have been presenting serious\nchallenges to the Federal Reserve in meeting its dual mandate of low and stable inflation\nand maximum sustainable employment and economic growth. These three\ndevelopments, of course, are the housing slump, the financial market turmoil and ensuing\ncredit crunch, and the surge in commodity prices, especially oil prices.\nToday I’d like to give you my own perspective on these developments, focusing\non where things stand now, their likely impact on the near-term outlook for economic\nactivity and inflation, and their implications for monetary policy.\nBefore discussing the current economic situation—that is, where things stand\nnow—let me set the stage by describing briefly how we got here. To get a little fanciful\nwith the stage-setting metaphor for a moment, it is a bit like the opening of Macbeth, with\nthe three ghastly witches brewing up trouble amid thunder and lightning—only here, the\n1\nThese remarks represent my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve\nSystem. I would like to thank the Economic Research staff for support in preparing these remarks, and in\nparticular, John Fernald, Fred Furlong, Reuven Glick, Rob Valletta, and Judith Goff.\n1\n\nthree troublemakers are the housing market, the financial markets, and commodity prices.\nThe housing market has been declining for a few years now. For example, residential\ninvestment has fallen by more than a third, in inflation-adjusted terms, since the end of\n2005. And house prices have tumbled—according to the various Case-Shiller home price\nindices, they are down some 15 to 20 percent over the past two years. For the first couple\nof years, the housing downturn appears to have had remarkably few spillovers to the rest\nof the economy in terms of curtailed spending. However, knock-on effects to the\nfinancial sector were brewing, for as house prices continued to fall, home mortgage\ndelinquencies started to rise. Indeed, the subprime mortgage market, which took off after\n2001 and ran strong through late 2005 largely on the expectation of continued home price\nappreciation, is now in shambles. After posting delinquency rates in the single digits in\n2005, around 20 percent of subprime mortgages are currently delinquent or in foreclosure\nnationwide.\nLast summer, it became clear that losses on subprime and other mortgages would\nbe far higher than markets had anticipated. This realization contributed to a broad\nreappraisal of credit market risks, which sparked the severe, ongoing financial market\ncrisis and credit crunch.\nMeanwhile, prices for oil and other commodities have continued a breathtaking\nrise. The average retail gasoline price was about $1.10/gallon at the beginning of 2002\nand is now above $4 a gallon. Food prices also spiked in early 2007.\nWeighed down by these growing troubles, the economy slowed sharply starting in\nthe fourth quarter of last year. Indeed, in the first quarter of this year, the growth rate of\nconsumer spending slowed to its lowest pace since the 2001 recession, and business fixed\n2\n\ninvestment stalled. On the consumer side, falling home and equity values have eroded\nhousehold wealth. Employment has fallen steadily since late last year, reducing\ndisposable income. In addition, surging food and gas prices mean that the income\npeople have gotten doesn’t go as far. So it’s not surprising that consumer sentiment has\nsoured on the economy. On the business side, the slowdown in demand, the elevated\nlevels of uncertainty,2 and tight financing conditions have continued to weigh on\ninvestment.\nIn the face of these adverse developments, the recent strength of spending data\nhas been somewhat reassuring. The pace of consumer spending, in particular, has been\nsurprisingly robust of late, fueled in part by tax rebates. The spending appeared to be\nbroad-based, with the not-so-surprising exception of motor vehicles, where sales have\nbeen very weak in recent months. On the business side, orders and shipments of\nnondefense capital goods excluding aircraft also look to have rebounded somewhat in\nrecent months. In addition, export growth has been a continuing bright spot. It has been\nbuoyed by continued strong growth abroad and by the weakening of the dollar. The\nstrong incoming data on spending ease my concerns somewhat about the intensity of the\nslowdown. However, a few months of data don’t make a trend, particularly because we\ncan’t be sure how large the effects of the roughly $100 billion temporary tax rebate\nprogram have been. About $50 billion of the rebates were sent out in May.\nInflation has become an increasing concern. Over the past twelve months, the\npersonal consumption expenditures—or PCE—price index rose 3.1 percent, up from 2.4\npercent over the prior year. An important reason for these disappointing numbers, of\n2 See Nick Bloom, “Will the credit crunch cause a recession?” CenterPiece, Spring 2008, pp. 20-23.\nhttp://www.stanford.edu/~nbloom/CreditCrunch.pdf.\n3\n\ncourse, is the rise in commodity prices. Some of those increases may have also passed\nthrough to core PCE price inflation, which excludes food and energy. This measure has\naveraged 2.1 percent over the past twelve months, which is slightly above the range that I\nconsider consistent with price stability, but very close to its pace of increase over the last\nseveral years.\nLet me say a few words on how conditions in San Diego compare with the\nnational economy. The troubles in the housing and finance sectors have perhaps been\neven more severe than elsewhere, with the unemployment rate in the area rising about 2\npercentage points since 2006—from a rate that was well below to a rate that is somewhat\nabove the national average. Not everyone is affected equally, of course, either here or\nelsewhere. For example, San Diego arguably is the nation’s leading center for\nbiotechnology research and development, and activity in this sector has continued\nexpanding strongly. Tourism is another important element of the local economy, and this\nsector also has been performing well—possibly reflecting, in part, an increase in foreign\ntourism spurred by the lower value of the dollar. The resulting job gains at restaurants\nand hotels, along with the associated income gains, have helped offset losses in other\nsectors. This view from San Diego highlights the point that, although the\nmacroeconomic effects of the shocks hitting the economy are felt broadly, they are not\nfelt evenly—either in San Diego or anywhere else.\nReturning to the national outlook, the key questions looking forward are: when\nwill economic activity get back to normal? And when will inflationary pressures\nmoderate? The answers to these questions depend, to a great extent, on how conditions\n4\n\nin the housing, financial, and commodity markets evolve. Let me discuss each of them in\nturn, beginning with housing.\nHousing\nChanges in housing prices are inextricably linked to household wealth, which in\nturn affects consumer spending, as well as prospects for housing construction.\nUnfortunately, it appears to me that there are at least three reasons for thinking that\nhousing prices have further to fall. First, the ratio of house prices to rents—a kind of\nprice-dividend ratio for housing— still remains quite high by historical standards, despite\nhaving fallen from its historical peak reached in early 2006. That suggests that further\nprice declines may be needed to bring housing markets into balance. Second, inventories\nof unsold homes remain at elevated levels. This “excess supply” of available homes will\nput downward pressure on housing prices. Indeed, these inventories are likely to directly\ndepress construction activity, since there is little point in building new homes when there\nis already a large backlog of unsold homes. Third, the futures market for house prices\npredicts further declines in a number of metropolitan areas this year. In particular, the\nCase-Shiller composite index for home prices shows a 15 to 20 percent year-over-year\ndecline in the second half of this year. The bottom line is that construction spending and\nhouse prices seem likely to continue to fall well into 2009.\nI would note that the housing market slowdown hit earlier and harder in San\nDiego than in most other parts of the state and the nation. Using the Case-Shiller index\nfor San Diego, the cumulative decline from the 2006 peak is approaching 30 percent.\n5\n\nSan Diego illustrates that the housing problems are not simply a consequence of too\nmuch subprime lending, since the growth in subprime mortgages during the housing\nboom was much more limited in the San Diego area than it was in the most highly\nexposed parts of California, Arizona, and Nevada. Nonetheless, mortgage delinquencies\nand home foreclosures in San Diego have grown noticeably over the past two years as\nprices have dropped. As with the rest of the country, it seems likely that further\nunpleasant adjustments in ownership and equity will be necessary before the housing\nmarket stabilizes.\nFinancial Markets\nThe ongoing fall in house prices has important implications for the financial\nmarkets, and it is one reason that we may continue to get troubling news from that part of\nthe economy. As I mentioned, falling house prices and, in particular, their effects on the\nsubprime market, helped trigger the financial market crisis last August. At that time, the\nFed and other central banks took the first steps to pump substantial volumes of reserves\ninto the system to respond to the surge in demand for liquidity. These and other further\nactions helped alleviate some of the stress in financial markets. But earlier this year,\nrenewed stress culminated in the near failure of Bear Stearns in March. Again, the Fed\ntook actions to avert the peril that such a failure could have posed for financial markets\nand the real economy. Since then, market stress has subsided to some degree, and better\nquality borrowers are still able to get credit. For example, investment-grade corporate\nbond issuance has been very strong in recent months, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\nhave been able to issue substantial quantities of mortgage-backed securities.\n6\n\nBut markets remain very fragile. For example, credit-default-swap spreads for\nmany financial institutions are again on the rise, the debt ratings for several important\nbond insurers have been cut, and stock prices for financial institutions have plummeted.\nThere is further evidence that financial markets are still not operating efficiently\nor effectively. In particular, the market for private-label securitized mortgages of even\nthe highest quality remains moribund. These securities were the primary source of\nfinancing for nonconforming residential mortgages, including subprime lending. Outside\nof the expanded FHA lending, there is little or no lending to higher-risk residential\nmortgage borrowers. Jumbo mortgages for prime borrowers are available, but at\nhistorically high spreads over rates on conventional mortgages, as banks have been\nreluctant to make these loans.\nUnfortunately, progress toward sturdier and more efficient financial markets is\ngoing to take some time, and that means the flow of credit is likely to remain impeded.\nLet me explain by using a plumbing metaphor. For one thing, it’s going to take time to\nclear the pipes of the problem debt. The gyrations in the prices of a number of securities\nsuggest that there are still hitches in the price discovery process. This may not be\nsurprising given that there is still a good deal of uncertainty about the valuation of\ncomplex, nontransparent financial instruments. There also is considerable uncertainty\nabout the extent of the ultimate losses and the exposure of different institutions. In the\ncase of residential mortgages, where delinquency rates are still rising, the single most\nimportant determinant of performance has been the pace of house price changes.3 But no\none is sure how much more house prices will fall, or how that will affect delinquency\n3 FRBSF 2007 Annual Report (2008)\nhttp://www.frbsf.org/publications/federalreserve/annual/2007/subprime.pdf.\n7\n\nrates on mortgages. The considerable uncertainty has added to the difficulty of valuing\nthe underlying mortgages and related asset-backed securities. Credit quality problems\nalso are emerging outside residential mortgages. At commercial banks, for example,\ndelinquencies are now rising almost across the board. Especially notable is the rise in\ndelinquency rates on construction loans that is affecting even institutions that had steered\nclear of the subprime market.\nMoreover, it is not just a matter of clearing the pipes of the problem debt. The\nplumbing itself needs to be redesigned and rebuilt. Indeed, to deal with some of the\nvulnerabilities laid bare by the turmoil over the past year requires some restructuring in\nparts of the financial market and the channels for allocating credit. Key areas of change\ninclude the originate-to-distribute model and securitization used to finance higher-risk\nmortgage debt, financial risk management, re-intermediation and deleveraging more\ngenerally, and regulation and oversight of financial markets.\nLet me take these one at a time. First, securitization was a key driver of the credit\nexpansion. Financial institutions originated loans that they then bundled into securities\nand sold to other investors. With hindsight, it is clear that this originate-to-distribute\nmodel suffered severe incentive problems—the originator had insufficient incentive to\nensure the quality of the loans, since someone else ultimately held them. Conflicts of\ninterest and moral hazard problems also are nested in the many other linkages in the\nsecuritization process.4 Before private-label mortgage securitization can recover,\nfinancial markets must design mechanisms to align the incentives of originators with the\n4 See, Adam B. Ashcraft and Til Schuermann (2008), “Understanding the Securitization of Subprime\nMortgage Credit.” Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Reports. no. 318, March 2008.\nhttp://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr318.pdf\n8\n\ninterests of the ultimate investors. Second, there was a widespread failure of risk\nmanagement, both in terms of liquidity and credit risk. An important shortcoming in\ncredit risk management was an excessive reliance on what turned out to be flawed\nassessments of risk by rating agencies of certain asset-backed securities. Investors, even\nlarge sophisticated financial institutions, did not take adequate steps to assess risk\nindependently. The lack of transparency in the credit process and the complexity of\nmany of the newer financial products did not help. Third, even with changes in\ncontracting and financial modeling, the re-intermediation process and deleveraging more\ngenerally is likely to continue. Re-intermediation involves a larger share of financing\nheld in the portfolios of institutions such as commercial banks and less by other investors\nholding securitized assets. The re-intermediation is part of deleveraging—that is less\nreliance on debt and more on equity financing—to the extent banks tend to hold more\ncapital than other less regulated financial institutions. We also will likely see less\nleverage in financing more generally. That is certainly evidenced by the greater shares of\nequity required in leveraged buyouts, as the pendulum is swinging back from the\nleveraged financing run amok that we saw even as late as the first part of 2007. While\nthese changes can improve the functioning of credit markets, they also likely will mean\nthat the cost of credit will be higher going forward. Finally, policymakers are likely to\nrevise the regulatory and supervisory environment in ways that will affect the structure,\nfunctioning, and oversight of financial markets, and that, too, will not be a speedy or\nsimple process.\nDuring the transition, financial institutions are struggling against forces that have\nexpanded their balance sheets even as they have sought to deleverage. Borrowers have\n9\n\ntapped outstanding credit lines, institutions have booked leveraged loans that they\ncouldn’t sell, and banks have brought onto their books assets from off-balance-sheet\nfunding conduits. The potential for further pressures on capital, along with institutions’\nlower tolerance for risk and concern about economic conditions, has resulted in banks\ntightening credit conditions for virtually all borrowers. In recent weeks, large banks have\nbeen cutting back on lending.\nGoing forward, the ability and willingness of commercial banks and other\nintermediaries to extend credit depends in part on their capacity to expand equity capital\ninternally and externally. The encouraging news is that large commercial banks,\ninvestment banks, and mortgage specialists have, to some extent, been able to issue new\nequity capital and to rebuild capital positions that have come under pressure from a\ncombination of losses and growth in assets.\nThe balance-sheet pressures, and broader financial market dislocations, are likely\nto be with us for some time. My expectation is that market functioning will improve\nmarkedly by 2009. But things could get worse before they get better. For example,\nhome prices could fall more than markets expect, leading to larger losses for financial\ninstitutions and further impairing their ability to make new loans. The credit crunch\ncould then lead to further declines in house prices. The resulting decline in household\nwealth could then further reduce spending, leading to additional knock-on effects. So an\nadverse feedback loop could develop, with consequences for both financial markets and\neconomic activity.\nCommodities\n10\n\nAs if housing and a credit crunch weren’t enough, prices for food and energy have\ngone through the roof. The spot price of West Texas intermediate crude oil has surged\nover 40 percent since January and over 100 percent in the last year, rising above $140 per\nbarrel in late June. Prices for other commodities, such as many metals and foods, have\nrisen sharply as well. Corn and wheat prices are up some 50 to 80 percent from a year\nago.\nThe debates about why commodity prices have surged are heard everywhere from\nthe nightly newscasts to the halls of Congress. While I don’t have a definitive answer\nmyself, I do think it makes sense to start by looking carefully at the supply and demand\nfundamentals, and, to my mind, they do appear to play a central role. On the demand\nside, booming economic activity in developing countries has boosted their appetite for\ncommodities. For example, since 2000, world demand for oil has increased by roughly\n11 million barrels per day, with China accounting for roughly 30 percent of this increase,\nand other developing countries accounting for another 60 percent. In addition, ethanol\nproduction accounts for a substantial amount of the increased demand for corn.\nOn the supply side, there have been constraints. Oil production has become more\nexpensive, major discoveries are increasingly difficult to find, and spare capacity to\nsupply more oil in the short run has been declining. As a result, energy supplies have not\nkept pace with growing worldwide demand. In some crop markets, bad weather has\nreduced supply. For example, drought conditions have hampered wheat production in\nAustralia, while excessive rainfall is affecting corn production here in the Midwest.\nNeither supply nor demand for commodities adjusts quickly, so large price\nchanges can occur in response to new information and other shocks to the market.\n11\n\nRecent volatility in oil prices appears to reflect a combination of news related to\nintensifying geopolitical concerns, falling inventories, and further deterioration in\nestimates of long-term supply.\nThere has been much discussion about speculative trading in commodities\nmarkets and its possible influence on recent price movements. Hedge funds, institutional\ninvestors, and other traders have certainly increased their positions in commodity\nmarkets, typically by investing in commodity index funds, which consist of baskets of\ndifferent commodities that trade on exchanges. But I am not yet persuaded that\nspeculation, rather than the fundamentals of global supply and demand, has played an\nimportant role in driving up prices. For example, it should be harder to speculate and\ntake positions on commodities that are not easy to trade on futures markets and are not\nincluded in index funds. But the prices of individual commodities that are not in index\nfunds have risen just as fast as those that are.\nIn addition, if speculators were important in driving prices up, then, at the high\nprices now prevailing, demand by nonspeculative end users would fall short of current\nsupply, causing inventories to rise. In fact, however, inventories appear to have been\ndeclining in most commodity markets.\nThere is no dearth of stories about how rising prices for oil, food, and other\ncommodities are hitting U.S. consumers and businesses. In the case of oil, we all feel the\npain when we go to the gas pump. Businesses also buy gasoline and other products made\nfrom oil, so their costs go up as well. If rising commodity prices reflect supply and\ndemand fundamentals, then the situation is not likely to turn around any time soon, and\nthe consequence is that everyone is going to see that their dollar just doesn’t stretch as far\n12\n\nanymore. In economists’ terms, “real wages”—that is, dollar wages expressed in terms\nof the goods and services they can buy—will rise more slowly or even fall. There is little\nthat monetary policy can do to prevent this.5\nThis is not a pleasant scenario, I grant you. Indeed, it raises the specter of the oil\nprice shocks of the 1970s, when over and above the inflation and real wage cuts due to\nsoaring energy costs, a more general inflation took hold, with wages and prices escalating\nthroughout the economy. The story of how it happened goes roughly like this.6\nWorkers—reasonably enough—asked for wage increases to pay the higher costs of food\nand energy. Their employers—mainly firms outside the energy sector--were in the same\ntough position as their employees: their costs were rising to the extent that they used oil\nas an input in production; and the prices they were receiving for their products were, at\nleast initially, rising no faster than before. But in spite of the fact that firms outside the\nenergy sector were not well positioned to assent to faster wage increases, they granted\nthem anyhow, figuring—reasonably enough, it turned out—that they could pass those\ncosts on into higher prices for their goods. Why was this reasonable enough thinking by\nfirms? Because both they and their competitors were all in the same unpleasant straits,\nand they did not believe that the Fed was willing or able to keep a lid on overall prices.\nThe result was an upward wage-price spiral that led to double-digit inflation. That\ninflation ended only after a major recession that sent the unemployment rate over 10\npercent. So we have learned from hard experience that, as unpleasant as lower real wages\n5 At the margins, the Federal Reserve might have some effect on the relative price of oil to the extent that\nchanges in interest rates affect the exchange rate. But the real value of the dollar has depreciated only\nmodestly over the past year, while oil prices have doubled. For this reason, the price of a barrel of oil has\nrisen sharply, whether valued in terms of a depreciating currency, like the dollar, or in terms of an\nappreciating currency, like the euro.\n6 For one contemporaneous and more complete discussion of the inflation of the 1970s, see Alan Blinder,\nEconomic Policy and the Great Stagflation, Academic Press (1979).\n13\n\nare, they are an unavoidable consequence of a fundamentals-driven rise in commodity\nprices. But the development of a wage-price spiral, due to a loss of credibility in the\nFed’s determination to suppress it, may have even more devastating consequences.\nOutlook\nNow I’d like to pull all of these threads together to give you my outlook for the\neconomy. Activity has been weak since late last year, and, given the three shocks I’ve\ndiscussed, I expect the economy to grow only modestly for the remainder of the year, but\nto pick up next year. The earlier policy easing by the Federal Reserve will help cushion\nthe economy from some of the effects of the shocks, and the fiscal stimulus program is\nhelping at present. Over time, the drag from housing will wane and credit conditions\nshould improve.\nOn the inflation front, the predominant problem so far has been soaring food and\nenergy prices. Headline inflation is likely to remain much higher than I would like over\nthe next few quarters. My best guess, which could easily be wrong, is that, consistent\nwith futures prices, commodity prices will level off and cease to put direct upward\npressure on headline inflation. Core inflation has been better contained, but has still been\nrunning a bit higher than I would like. In the next few quarters, I wouldn’t be surprised if\nit runs modestly higher, as businesses pass some of their higher energy and transportation\ncosts on to customers. By early next year, however, I expect that, assuming commodity\nprices level off, core as well as headline inflation will moderate, as more slack in labor\nand product markets emerges. .\nPolicy\n14\n\nLet me now turn to monetary policy. We’re approaching a crossroads. The\nFOMC responded to the difficult economic conditions that emerged last year by easing\nmonetary policy substantially. Between September and April, the Committee reduced the\nfederal funds rate by 3(cid:1) percentage points to its current rate of 2 percent. With core\nconsumer inflation running at about the same rate, the real funds rate is now around zero.\nThese cuts in the target rate, along with the actions to foster greater liquidity in financial\nmarkets, have mitigated the worst effects of the squeeze on spending. I am somewhat\nreassured by the recent data, which suggest that my biggest fears on the downside have,\nso far, been avoided. Of course, the underlying housing, credit, and commodity-price\nissues are far from fully resolved. My discussion of those issues makes clear that a lot of\nuncertainty surrounds my outlook. A lot could still go wrong.\nBut maximum sustainable employment is only one of our mandates. The other is\nlow and stable inflation. In the wake of rapid increases in prices for gasoline and food,\nconsumer survey measures of longer term inflation expectations have turned up. In\ncontrast, other surveys, such as the Survey of Professional Forecasters, show little erosion\nin long-term inflation expectations. In addition, the anecdotes I hear are more consistent\nwith credibility than with an upward wage-price spiral. In particular, my contacts\nuniformly report that they see no signs of general wage pressures.\nOn balance, I still see inflation expectations as reasonably well anchored and I\nanticipate that consumer survey measures will come down once oil and food prices stop\nrising. But the risks to inflation are likely not symmetric and they have definitely\nincreased. We cannot and will not allow a wage-price spiral to develop.\n15\n\nAs I began with a reference to Shakespeare, let me end with one as well: For\nmonetary policymakers, “readiness is all.” By this I mean that, in the face of these\ncompeting risks, we will monitor developments carefully and be prepared to act as\nneeded to fulfill our mandate for sustainable economic growth and price stability.\n# # #\n16",

Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on September 14, 2009, 12:50 PM Pacific, 3:50 PM Eastern\nThe Outlook for Recovery in the U.S. Economy1\nF\nIt’s a pleasure to appear before a group of professionals who spend as much time trying\nto understand the financial markets and the economy as I do. It’s fair to say that the last two or\nthree years have provided all of us an education—a far-from-welcome one—of just how\ncomplex these subjects are. We have had to rethink old assumptions and question conventional\nwisdom in the face of a crisis whose dimensions few of us might have imagined.\nI am hugely relieved that our financial system appears to have survived this near-death\nexperience. And, as painful as this recession has been, I believe that we succeeded in avoiding\nthe second Great Depression that seemed to be a real possibility. Much of the recent economic\ndata suggest that the economy has bottomed out and that the worst risks are behind us. The\neconomy seems to be brushing itself off and beginning its climb out of the deep hole it’s been in.\nThat’s the good news. But I regret to say that I expect the recovery to be tepid. What’s\nmore, the gradual expansion gathering steam will remain vulnerable to shocks. The financial\nsystem has improved but is not yet back to normal. It still holds hazards that could derail a\nfragile recovery. Even if the economy grows as I expect, things won’t feel very good for some\ntime to come. In particular, the unemployment rate will remain elevated for a few more years,\nmeaning hardship for millions of workers. Moreover, the slack in the economy, demonstrated by\nhigh unemployment and low utilization of industrial capacity, threatens to push inflation lower at\n1 I would like to thank John Judd, Rob Valletta, and Sam Zuckerman for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n1\n\na time when it is already below the level that, in the view of most members of the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC) best promotes the Fed’s dual mandate for full employment and price\nstability.

My comments are my own and do not necessarily reflect the\nviews of my Federal Reserve colleagues.\nAs I noted, we’ve come a long way since last year when the financial system was\nteetering on the edge of collapse. To me, it’s plain that the extraordinary and aggressive\nresponse of governments and central banks around the world saved the day—heading off the\nkind of financial meltdown that would have inflicted catastrophic damage on the economy.\nSome are skeptical about the effectiveness of emergency programs such as TARP, TAF, and\nTALF. But, in my view, these programs staved off disaster. And they have been keeping the\npatient on essential life support as little by little it begins to breathe again on its own.\nWhile the worst was avoided, the financial shock that did hit the economy was awful\nenough. The economy finally fell into recession at the end of 2007 when, on top of an ongoing\ndrag from a contracting housing sector, the ever-dependable American consumer—who had\nshrugged off one shock after another in years past—finally succumbed to the fallout from the\nfinancial crisis. Since the beginning of the downturn, real GDP has fallen by a bit short of 4\npercent and the unemployment rate has jumped by nearly 5 percentage points. Few, if any, parts\nof the economy have escaped the devastation. In addition to the setbacks in housing and\nconsumer spending, business investment, exports, and imports all fell off the table.\n2\n\nI’m happy to report that the downturn has probably now run its course. This summer\nlikely marked the end of the recession and the economy should expand in the second half of this\nyear. A wide array of data supports this view. However, payrolls are still shrinking at a rapid\npace, even though the momentum of job losses has slowed in the past few months. The housing\nsector finally seems to be improving. Home sales and starts are once again rising from very low\nlevels, and home prices appear to be stabilizing, even rising in recent months according to some\nnational measures. Meanwhile, manufacturing is also beginning to show signs of life, helped\nparticularly by a rebound in motor vehicle production. Importantly, consumer spending finally is\nbottoming out.\nA particularly hopeful sign is that inventories, which have been shrinking rapidly, now\nseem to be in better alignment with sales. That’s occurred because firms slashed production\nrapidly and dramatically in the face of slumping sales. Recent data suggest that this correction\nmay be near an end and firms are now poised to step up production to match sales. In fact, I\nexpect the biggest source of expansion in the second half of this year to come from a diminished\npace of inventory liquidation by manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers. Such a pattern is\ntypical of business cycles. Inventory investment often is the catalyst for economic recoveries.\nTrue, the boost is usually fairly short-lived, but it can be quite important in getting things going.\nNowhere is this cycle more evident than in the auto sector. Production cutbacks this year have\nled to sharp reductions in inventories. Recently, sales of light vehicles have begun to rise, in part\ndue to the government’s cash-for-clunkers program. As a result, auto manufacturing has picked\nup and, with inventories lean, prospects are good for further production increases.\nIn all of these sectors, improved financial conditions have played a vital part in\nstimulating greater activity. To be sure, the financial system is not yet back to normal and credit\n3\n\nis still tight. But there have been notable improvements. The stock market rally has helped\nhouseholds recover some of their lost wealth and provided a much-needed psychological boost.\nInvestors have regained some of their appetite for risk. Interest rates on corporate bonds—\nespecially for less-than-prime firms—have dropped sharply and issuance has been brisk. Federal\nReserve programs to support the mortgage market have helped push rates down. And other Fed\nprograms have helped jump-start issuance of securities backed by consumer and small business\nloans. In the short-term wholesale funding markets, measures of stress have also diminished.\nThe fiscal stimulus program passed by Congress in February also deserves credit for\nhelping the economy turn the corner. Its tax cuts have raised disposable income, and\ngovernment spending is directly adding to payrolls, providing another source of household\nincome. Much of the stimulus money remains to be spent and will add to growth as the year\nproceeds.\nThe normal dynamics of the business cycle have also turned more favorable. Some\neconomic sectors are growing again simply because they sank so low. The inventory adjustment\nI just discussed is one factor, although the biggest part of those benefits usually is only felt for a\nfew quarters. But other business cycle patterns can be longer lasting. Demand for houses,\ndurable goods such as autos, and business equipment is beginning to revive as households and\nfirms replace or upgrade needed equipment and structures.\nI’d like to pause for a moment to make a few observations about the Bay Area economy.\nThe recession has been felt keenly here. Employment is down about 6 percentage points from its\npeak in late 2007. The unemployment rate has risen by more than 6 percentage points to just\nover 10 percent from its low point in late 2006, outstripping the national increase.\n4\n\nA harsh slump in information technology, due to plunging business spending on tech\nequipment and services, has prompted extensive job cuts and been a key factor driving down the\narea economy. Employment has fallen especially steeply on the hardware side, although IT\nservice providers have cut back as well.\nFortunately, IT seems to be on the mend. Sales of U.S.-made semiconductors are up\nsubstantially in recent months, prompting some prominent companies to bump up earnings\noutlooks for the remainder of the year. My local contacts have noted an uptick in venture capital\ninvestment, and they say that companies that received venture funding in the past are doing\nbetter at meeting performance benchmarks. Overall, the area’s IT industry is in much better\nshape than it was following the dot-com bust of the early 2000s. Clearly, it has struggled during\nthis downturn. But, this time around, it is not recovering from bubble-driven overexpansion, so\nit is well-positioned to take advantage of an economic upswing.\nThe area’s housing market is also showing signs of life. Sales of existing homes have\nbeen rising since late last year. Of course, the pickup has been propelled in part by sales of\nforeclosed homes and widespread availability of properties at bargain-basement prices. As we\nall know, Bay Area home prices have been decimated. Estimates of the cumulative decline over\nthe past few years range from about 15 percent to as high as 45 percent. Many local\nhomeowners are under water, and that’s helped feed the foreclosure wave. While it’s too soon to\nbe sure, this pernicious process may finally be coming to an end. Some recent data show price\nincreases and a notable pickup in sales of higher-end properties over the past few months.\nReturning to the national economy, the all-important question is how strong the upturn\nwill be. With unemployment at 9.7 percent of the workforce and capacity utilization at its lowest\n5\n\nlevel of the post-World War II period, the economy has an enormous amount of slack. That\ngives us plenty of room to grow rapidly over the next few years. Indeed, we need to grow\nrobustly to alleviate the enormous human toll resulting from high unemployment and the waste\nof so much idle industrial capacity. At first glance, history suggests that a vigorous expansion\ncould very well take place. Following previous deep recessions, the United States typically saw\nV-shaped recoveries. For example, the economy grew at an average rate of nearly 6 percent\nduring the two years following the severe recession in 1981-82.\nThis time though rapid growth does not seem to be in store. My own forecast envisions a\nfar less robust recovery, one that would look more like the letter U than V. And I’m not alone.\nThe Blue Chip consensus forecast, reflecting the views of nearly 50 professional forecasters,\nanticipates by far the weakest recovery of the postwar era over the next year and a half. A large\nbody of evidence supports this guarded outlook. It is consistent with experiences around the\nworld following recessions caused by financial crises.2 That seems to be because it takes quite a\nF F\nwhile for financial systems to heal to the point that normal credit flows are restored. That is\nwhat I expect this time. In the buildup to the recession, financial institutions became highly\nleveraged, a vulnerability compounded by investments in complex and risky assets funded with\nshort-term debt. In an attempt to improve credit quality and reduce risk, banks have now\ntightened business and consumer lending standards. They have been doing so at the same time\nthat rising unemployment and falling house prices have fed additional credit losses.\nUnfortunately, more credit losses are in store even as the economy improves and overall\nfinancial conditions ease. Certainly, households remain stressed. In the face of high and rising\nunemployment, delinquencies and foreclosures are showing no sign of turning around. The\n2 See Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) for evidence on this issue.\n6\n\ndelinquency rate on adjustable-rate mortgages is now up to about 18 percent, and, on fixed-rate\nloans, it’s about 6 percent.3 Delinquencies on both types of loans have increased sharply over\nF F\nthe past year and are still rising. This trend is consistent across other major loan categories, and\nis affecting high- and low-quality borrowers alike. Even recent-vintage loans are experiencing\nrising delinquency rates.\nWhile it is important for economic recovery that lenders provide credit to worthy\nhouseholds and businesses, they also must maintain enough capital to withstand losses—even if\neconomic conditions turn out to be worse than anticipated. In the face of continuing credit\nlosses, moves by lenders to shrink assets, reduce leverage, and conserve capital are restricting the\nprovision of credit in the economy. For example, the Fed’s Senior Loan Officer Survey on Bank\nLending Practices conducted in July showed that, for consumer loans, far more banks are\ntightening standards than easing them, despite some improvements in this measure in recent\nmonths.\nNormally, if credit flows were restricted by these types of financial headwinds, the Fed\nwould ease the stance of monetary policy by cutting its federal funds rate target. But the funds\nrate is already at zero for all practical purposes, leaving the Fed’s traditional policy tool as\naccommodative as it can be. In fact, many versions of the Taylor rule, a well-known policy\nbenchmark based on the state of the economy and inflation, indicate that we should lower the\nfunds rate well below this zero bound—if such a thing were possible. To provide more\naccommodation, the Fed has used unconventional policy tools. Collectively, these programs,\nwhich have provided us a slew of new acronyms, appear to be helping. But we have little\n3 These figures refer to mortgages that are delinquent for 60 or more days or are in foreclosure.\n7\n\nexperience with them and the extent of their effectiveness is highly uncertain. So here’s the\nbottom line: Financial conditions have clearly eased compared to the darkest days of the\nfinancial crisis. But the financial system is still far from healthy and tight credit is likely to put a\ndamper on growth for some time to come.\nA sputtering financial system is not the only challenge before us. The chances are slim\nfor a robust rebound in consumer spending, which represents around 70 percent of economic\nactivity. Of course, consumers are getting a boost from the fiscal stimulus package. But this\nprogram is temporary. Over the long term, consumers face daunting issues of their own. In fact,\nit’s easy to draw a comparison between the financial state of households and that of financial\ninstitutions. For years prior to the recession, households went on a spending spree. This\noccurred during a period that economists call the “Great Moderation,” about two decades when\nrecessions were infrequent and mild, and inflation was low and stable. Credit became ever easier\nto get and consumers took advantage of this to borrow and buy. Stock and home prices rose year\nafter year, giving households additional wherewithal to keep spending. In this culture of\nconsumption, the personal saving rate fell from around 10 percent in the mid-1980s to 1½\npercent or lower in recent years. At the same time, households took on larger proportions of\ndebt. From 1960 to the mid-1980s, debt represented a manageable 65 percent of disposable\nincome. Since then, it has risen steadily, with a notable acceleration in the last economic\nexpansion. By 2008, it had doubled to about 130 percent of income.\nIt may well be that we are witnessing the start of a new era for consumers following the\ntraumatic financial blows they have endured.4 The destruction of their nest eggs caused by\nF F\nfalling house and stock prices is prompting them to rebuild savings. The personal saving rate is\n4 See Glick and Lansing (2009).\n8\n\nfinally on the rise, averaging almost 4½ percent so far this year. While certainly sensible from\nthe standpoint of individual households, this retreat from debt-fueled consumption could reduce\nthe growth rate of consumer spending for years. An increase in saving should ultimately support\nthe economy’s capacity to produce and grow by channeling resources from consumption to\ninvestment. And higher investment is the key to greater productivity and faster growth in living\nstandards. But the transition could be painful if subpar growth in consumer spending holds back\nthe pace of economic recovery.\nWeakness in the labor market is another factor that may keep the recovery in low gear for\na while. As I mentioned, payroll employment has been plummeting for a year and a half. While\nthe August employment report offered more evidence that the pace of the decline has slowed,\nunemployment now stands at its highest level since 1983. My business contacts indicate that\nthey will be very reluctant to hire again until they see clear evidence of a sustained recovery, and\nthat suggests we could see another so-called jobless recovery in which employment growth lags\nthe improvement in overall output. What’s more, wage growth has slowed sharply. Over the\nfirst half of this year, the employment cost index for private-industry workers has risen by a\nmeager three-quarters of one percent. Unemployment, job insecurity, and low growth in\nincomes will undoubtedly take a toll on consumption. When the array of problems facing\nconsumers is considered, it is hard to see how we can avoid sluggish spending growth.\nPutting the whole puzzle together, the main impetus to growth in the second half of this\nyear will be inventory investment. The boost it provides will be a big help for a while, but we\nwill need to look to other sectors to sustain growth. The fact that the largest sector of the\neconomy—consumer spending—is likely to be lackluster implies a less-than-robust expansion.\n9\n\nEven the gradual recovery we expect will be vulnerable to shocks, especially from the financial\nsector. As I said, financial conditions are better, but not back to normal. And the likelihood of\ncontinuing losses by financial institutions will add new fuel to the credit crunch. In particular,\nsmall and medium-size banks could experience damaging losses on commercial real estate loans.\nThus far, the largest losses have been on loans for construction and land development. Going\nforward, however, rising loan losses on other commercial real estate lending is likely because\nproperty values are falling, office vacancy rates are rising, and credit remains tight or nonexistent\nfor those many property owners that will need to refinance mortgages over the next few years.\nFinancial contagion from this sector is one of the most important threats to recovery.\nThe slow recovery I expect means that it could still take several years to return to full\nemployment. The same is true for capacity utilization in manufacturing. It will take a long time\nbefore these human and capital resources are put to full use.\nThis brings me to the complex topic of inflation. In my career, I have never witnessed a\nsituation like the one that exists now, when views about inflation risks have coalesced into two\ndiametrically opposed camps. On the one hand, one group worries about the long-term\ninflationary implications of a seemingly endless procession of massive federal budget deficits.\nAt the same time, others fear that economic slack and downward wage pressure are pushing\ninflation below rates that are considered consistent with price stability and even raising the\nspecter of outright deflation. This dichotomy is on display among the participants in the Survey\nof Professional Forecasters. The lowest quartile of forecasters focuses on disinflation over the\nnext five years. The top quartile is preoccupied with the possibility of rising inflation five to ten\nyears out.\n10\n\nThe fear of higher long-term inflation reflects, to a large degree, worries about Fed\nmonetary policy. Our array of new programs to spur the economy have pumped up our balance\nsheet and created a huge quantity of bank reserves in the process. Some worry that we won’t be\nable to shrink our balance sheet because of political pressures, and in the process we will end up\nmonetizing the government debt. This fear is real, growing, and disruptive. That’s why it’s so\nimportant for me to say the following loud and clear: We at the Fed are and will remain fiercely\nindependent from politics. We have the means—and we certainly have the will—to tighten\npolicy when the time is right. In fact, by raising the interest rate that we pay on excess reserves\nwe can tighten monetary policy even before our balance sheet shrinks. And we are, as always,\nsteadfast in our determination to achieve both of our statutory goals of full employment and price\nstability.\nMy personal belief is that the more significant threat to price stability over the next\nseveral years stems from the disinflationary forces unleashed by the enormous slack in the\neconomy. The 1980s provides a useful historical comparison. During that period, fears about\nburgeoning federal deficits and an unsustainable fiscal situation were widespread, as they are\ntoday. Moreover, the Fed was under significant political pressure, and some worried whether it\nwould be able to safeguard its independence. But those circumstances didn’t ignite a renewed\nbout of inflation. Unemployment nearly hit 11 percent in 1982 and oil prices were sinking. Core\npersonal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation—the Fed’s preferred measure—fell about 6\npercentage points during the first half of the 1980s.\nOf course, that period differed from ours in one critical respect. Then, inflation was\ncoming down from unacceptably high levels. Monetary policy was designed to be tight enough\nto bring inflation down to price stability, a goal we accomplished and have maintained for two-\n11\n\nand-a-half decades. Today, we are starting with very low inflation. Core PCE price inflation has\naveraged just under 1½ percent over the past twelve months, which is already below the 2\npercent rate that I and most of my FOMC colleagues consider an appropriate long-term price\nstability objective. With slack likely to persist for years, it seems likely that core inflation will\nmove even lower, departing yet farther from our price stability objective.\nFrom a monetary policy point of view, the landscape will continue to present challenges.\nWe face an economy with substantial slack, prospects for only moderate growth, and low and\ndeclining inflation. With our policy rate already as low as it can go, it’s no wonder that the\nFOMC’s last statement indicated that “economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally\nlow levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.” I can assure you that we will be\nready, willing, and able to tighten policy when it’s necessary to maintain price stability. But,\nuntil that time comes, we need to defend our price stability goal on the low side and promote full\nemployment. Thank you very much.\n12\n\nReferences\nGlick, Reuven, and Kevin J.

    "text": "Speech to the Central Valley Banking Forum\nFresno, California\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nNovember 14, 2006, 1:00 PM Pacific Standard Time\nExploring the Valley's Unbanked Opportunity\nGood afternoon. I’m Janet Yellen, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of\nSan Francisco. On behalf of the San Francisco Fed and our co-hosts, the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation, the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency, and the Office of Thrift Supervision, I would like to thank\nyou for joining us today to explore innovative ways to help immigrants and low-income\nfamilies in the Central Valley access mainstream financial services.1 As I will discuss\nlater in my remarks, access to a bank account is an important stepping stone to financial\nstability for these families, and I commend you on your efforts.\nBefore I begin, I have to confess that this is my first real visit to Fresno. Like many\ncoastal residents, my Central Valley experience has been limited to driving through it on\nmy way north. While I-5 and highway 99 are iconic symbols of a region that stretches\nfrom Redding to Bakersfield, everyone in this room knows it is a mistake to equate the\nCentral Valley with these narrow bands of asphalt. It is really only when you get off the\nfreeway and venture onto the Valley’s city streets and rural back roads that its richness\nbecomes apparent. The communities of the Valley are incredibly diverse, bringing\ntogether early settlers from Texas and Oklahoma with recent migrants from Mexico and\nSoutheast Asia. Once predominately rural, the Valley has become increasingly urban,\nwith Fresno, Modesto, Sacramento, Stockton and Bakersfield now ranked among the\nlargest 100 cities in the country. And yet agriculture remains a vital part of the region’s\neconomy, producing approximately a quarter of the nation’s food supply and over 300\ndifferent crops. Yesterday, I had the opportunity to drive to Fresno from San Francisco\nand see first-hand one of the richest agricultural regions in the United States.\nDriving along Shaw Avenue in Fresno reveals another side to the Central Valley,\nhowever: the challenge of persistent poverty in the region. More than 400,000 children\nin the Central Valley are growing up in poor families, with significant consequences for\ntheir future well-being.2 This statistic alone highlights the importance of community\ndevelopment in the region, and the role it plays in ensuring that low-income families and\nneighborhoods benefit from the region’s vitality and growth.\nAs President of the San Francisco Fed, I often talk about monetary policy and the Fed’s\nmandated goals of price stability and maximum sustainable output and employment.\n1\nIn this speech, the Central Valley refers to the 19 counties of Butte, Colusa, El Dorado, Fresno, Glenn,\nKern, Kings, Madera, Merced, Placer, Sacramento, San Joaquin, Shasta, Stanislaus, Sutter, Tehama,\nTulare, Yolo, and Yuba.\n2 U.S. Census 2000 Summary File 3 (SF 3) – Table P87. Poverty Status in 1999 by Age.\n\nToday, I’d like to step away from this big picture—to leave the freeway, if you will—and\nreflect on the role of community development in the Valley. While perhaps not as well\nknown as its monetary policy role, the Federal Reserve also conducts research and\noutreach on community development as part of its official responsibility for enforcing the\nCommunity Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws for state member banks.\nMy remarks today will focus on two key themes. The first theme is the importance of\ntailoring community development policies to local needs and priorities, recognizing and\nresponding to the unique factors that shape poverty in places like Patterson and Modesto.\nThe second theme is the importance of using strategic collaborations among public,\nprivate, and nonprofit organizations to leverage resources for community development.\nLessons from the Community Development Field\nThe fact that I’m even talking about “local needs” and the importance of “public/private\npartnerships” is evidence of how much the community development field has changed\nover the last 40 years. In 1964, when President Lyndon B. Johnson famously declared\nthat “for the first time in our history, it is possible to conquer poverty,”3 these concepts\nwere not part of the community development lexicon. Neighborhood revitalization\nprojects were much more likely to involve federal mandates and bulldozers than ‘design\ncharettes’ or ‘asset mapping.’ The large-scale public housing projects of the 1940s and\nthe urban renewal efforts of the 1960s had unintended consequences, isolating residents\nfrom educational and economic opportunities and creating neighborhoods with high\nlevels of concentrated poverty, unemployment, and crime.\nClearly, our approach to community development has evolved considerably since\nJohnson’s day. For one thing, I think we have all become much more humble about our\nability to address the underlying causes of poverty. We now know that effective\ncommunity development isn’t about building affordable housing units alone—it requires\na comprehensive approach that provides job training, supports entrepreneurs, offers\nopportunities to save and build assets, and connects families to important services like\nreliable transportation and child care. We also have become more sophisticated in the\nways we fund community development activities. While early community development\nprojects were funded largely by centralized federal grants, today’s initiatives are more\nlikely to be financed by a combination of public and private dollars, and entails both\nequity and debt financing. Community development efforts are also much more likely to\ninvolve residents in the planning process, compared with just 40 years ago.\nUnderpinning these new approaches to community development are two important\nprinciples. First, in order to be successful, community development programs must\nreflect the needs of local communities and build on local priorities and assets.\nResearchers have demonstrated that poverty is driven by different factors in different\nplaces: while one community may be suffering from deindustrialization and loss of\nemployment opportunities, another community may be poor as the result of rapid\n3\nLyndon B. Johnson's Special Message to Congress, March 16, 1964.\n\npopulation growth and the proliferation of seasonal, low-wage jobs. Successful strategies\ntake into account these differences, and respond to the unique attributes of each\nneighborhood, including the skills of its labor force, its economic base, and the cultural\nvalues of its residents. Programs like the Community Development Block Grant reflect\nthis new approach, and allow local governments to direct CDBG funds to programs that\nbest meet the needs of their communities.\nThe second principle is that today’s community development strategies are much more\nlikely to rely on partnerships across a wide range of stakeholders. This change has been\nparticularly important as emphasis has shifted away from the top-down, government-led\nprojects of the 1950s and 60s. Partnerships among neighborhood leaders, CDCs,\nintermediaries, the private sector, and government are necessary to mobilize the\nfinancing, technical expertise, and political will needed to tackle poverty. The\nCommunity Reinvestment Act has been pivotal in enlisting the support of the banking\nsystem in fostering these partnerships, particularly in the area of community development\nfinance. Today, financial institutions make more than $100 billion in CRA-related loans\nand investments each year.4 These dollars provide one of the largest and most sustained\nsources of capital to low- and moderate-income communities and families. Although the\nCRA has been controversial at times, I believe it has made an important contribution to\nthe field, one with benefits to communities across the country.\nI believe these two principles—tailoring strategies to local priorities and assets, and\nworking through partnerships—are particularly relevant for community development in\nthe Central Valley. Programs developed for other communities may not provide very\ngood road maps for tackling poverty in the Central Valley. Fresno may rank as the city\nwith the most highly concentrated poverty in the country,5 but the communities south of\nShaw do not mirror what we see when we drive around the dilapidated high rise buildings\nof Chicago’s South Shore. How Fresno responds to the problem of concentrated poverty\nwill have to address the unique needs of this community and build on the activities of\nlocal organizations already in the neighborhood.\nWhat makes community development in the Central Valley different? First, the pace and\nscale of population growth in the Central Valley is remarkable, and distinguishes it from\nother regions confronting high rates of poverty. Many rural communities in Appalachia\nand the Mississippi Delta—to which the Central Valley is often compared—have seen\ntheir populations steadily decline.6 Similarly, cities like Detroit and Cleveland—classic\nexamples of cities struggling with high poverty neighborhoods —have lost nearly half\ntheir population in the past forty years.7 In contrast, the Central Valley is one of the\n4 Michael S. Barr (2005). “Credit Where It Counts: The Community Reinvestment Act and Its Critics,”\nNew York University Law Review 75: 101-233.\n5\nAlan Berube and Bruce Katz (2005). “Katrina’s Window: Confronting Concentrated Poverty Across\nAmerica.” The Brookings Institution: Washington, D.C.\n6 Kenneth Johnson (2006). “Demographic Trends in Rural and Small Town America,” Reports on Rural\nAmerica, Volume 1, Number 1, Carsey Institute, The University of New Hampshire, p. 14.\n7 Data from the U.S. Census, historical time series data. Between 1960 and 2003, Detroit’s population\ndropped from 1,670,144 to 911,402; Cleveland’s population dropped from 876,050 to 461,324 over the\nsame time period. In contrast, Fresno grew from 133,929 to 451,455.\n\nfastest growing regions in the state. During the past 10 years, the Central Valley has\ngained more than one million new residents. By 2005, its population had reached 6.5\nmillion, more than the population of 38 states.8 Demographers predict that by 2020, the\nCentral Valley will be home to one in five Californians.9\nSecond, the increasing diversity of the Valley’s population has been as remarkable as its\npopulation growth. As recently as 1980, three out of every four residents in the Valley\nwere non-Hispanic white. Within the next couple of years, no racial or ethnic group will\nconstitute a majority of the Valley’s population. Growth has been especially strong\namong Latino and Asian populations, with the Latino population increasing fivefold and\nthe Asian population increasing more than fourfold between 1970 and 2000.10\nThese two factors alone fundamentally shape the challenge of community development in\nthe Valley. On one hand, this demographic change and growth holds much promise.\nImmigrants are a powerful economic market, and often help to strengthen communities\nby creating a demand for housing and by jumpstarting small businesses. The large\nnumber of families with young children also lends vitality to the region, and can serve as\nthe foundation for healthy and civically engaged communities.\nOn the other hand, the scale of growth places real demands on the region’s ability to\nbuild new schools and roads, provide jobs, supply water and power, and protect the\nenvironment. Government agencies and local nonprofits have not been able to keep pace\nwith the region’s rapid growth, and funding per capita for community development\nactivities falls well below resources available to organizations in places like Los Angeles\nand San Francisco. 11 As the demand for housing in the region has pushed home and land\nvalues upwards, it has become increasingly difficult to build affordable housing. The\nlarge number non-English speaking immigrants, especially those with little education or\nformal job training, also presents challenges for educational and job development\nprograms in the region.\nThese trends raise questions about the types of community development strategies that\nwill be needed to respond to poverty in the Central Valley. How can we meet the\nworkforce development needs of the immigrant population, and take into account the\nseasonal nature of agricultural labor? How can we think more broadly about the\nresources that might be available for community development in the Valley? What\ninnovative financing can be brought to bear on the challenge of providing affordable\nhousing? Is there a role for rural venture capital? And how can we engage religious\norganizations, employers, and other community institutions in the Valley’s community\ndevelopment activities?\n8 Public Policy Institute of California (2006). “Just the Facts: California’s Central Valley.” Public Policy\nInstitute of California: San Francisco, CA.\n9 State of California, Department of Finance, Population Projections by Race/Ethnicity for California and\nIts Counties 2000–2050, Sacramento, California, May 2004.\n10 Hans P. Johnson and Joseph M. Hayes (2004). The Central Valley at a Crossroads: Migration and Its\nImplications.

Great Valley Center: Modesto, CA.\n\nThese are not easy questions to answer. But I think that there is a real opportunity for the\nCentral Valley to develop innovative, creative approaches to them, approaches that will\nserve as models for other rapidly growing areas in the West like Las Vegas, Tucson, and\nEl Paso. Many of the community development initiatives across the Valley have already\ntaken a step in this direction—taking a ‘traditional’ challenge like affordable housing or\nsmall business development and giving the solution a uniquely “Central Valley” stamp.\nWhile I do not have time to discuss all the good programs in the region, let me just\nhighlight three that demonstrate this powerful combination of local innovation and broad\nbased partnerships.\nOne of the early community development efforts in the Central Valley—and, ironically,\nstarting right at the time that East Coast cities were struggling with the unintended\nconsequences of large-scale urban renewal programs—was in the area of affordable\nhousing. In 1965, Self-Help Enterprises opened its doors in Visalia as the first rural self-\nhelp housing organization in the nation.12 Initially established to meet the housing needs\nof migratory farm workers in the Central Valley, the organization’s programs have\nevolved to meet the changing needs of local residents. While still building affordable\nrental units and helping small rural communities in places like Kern County build water\nand sewer connections, Self-Help has expanded its work to help low-income families\nbecome homeowners.\nThis shift to affordable homeownership opportunities reflects a changing local reality—\nimmigrants and farm workers in the Central Valley are becoming less transitory, and are\neager to establish roots in their new home, build assets, and provide community stability.\nAs of the end of 2005, Self-Help has helped over 5,000 low-income families become\nhomeowners.13 In partnership with other community-based organizations and local\ngovernment agencies, Self-Help also provides a wide range of other critical kinds of\nsupport, including computer training classes, English as a Second Language classes, early\nchildhood education, and business education workshops. Today, the Self-Help model is\nbeing replicated in rural communities across the country.\nSecond, the Fresno Regional Jobs Initiative, a public-private partnership that seeks to\ncreate 30,000 new jobs that pay an average annual salary of just under $30,000 by 2008,\nalso reflects this spirit of local innovation.14 This initiative is a partnership involving\nhundreds of business, civic, and public organizations that aims to strengthen and diversify\nthe region’s economic base. What is noteworthy about this effort is that it seeks to build\non the region’s strengths in promoting economic development and new jobs, identifying\nindustry clusters such as irrigation technology, and working with Fresno State to develop\n12 Fannie Mae Foundation (1999).

Implementation Plan. Available at http://www.fresnorji.org/about/.\n\ntraining programs for Valley residents to learn these new technologies. The Regional\nJobs Initiative is also unique in that, before even developing its strategic plan, the staff\nsought out the views and input of business, education, civic, and grass roots leaders. The\nvalues and strategies developed through this collaborative process guide the RJI’s\nmission, and ensure that the initiative’s outcomes are consistent with local priorities.\nFinally, other local partnerships are working to help immigrants become successful\nentrepreneurs. The Valley Small Business Development Corporation, which began by\nworking with Hmong farmers in the region, recently partnered with the Fresno Area\nHispanic Chamber of Commerce and Wells Fargo to extend their services to the Hispanic\npopulation. Wells Fargo provided an initial $250,000 equity-equivalent investment to the\npartnership for a revolving loan pool. The initial pool of capital was disbursed within the\nfirst 30 days of the program’s existence, and Wells Fargo has since invested an additional\n$500,000 in the program. The program has resulted in 35 loans to local Hispanic\nentrepreneurs, helping to stimulate new business activity, create jobs, and contribute to\nthe long-term financial stability of these families. These successes would not have been\npossible without drawing on the cultural knowledge and community connections of the\nHispanic Chamber.15\nI would like to conclude my remarks by coming back to the reason why you’re all here\ntoday. These principles of local innovation and collaboration are evident in the\ndiscussions you had this morning about expanding access to mainstream financial\nservices. A bank account is certainly not a solution to poverty, but it is an important\nbuilding block for financial security for low-income families. Without a bank account,\nfamilies often must resort to check cashers and payday lenders, paying more for basic\nfinancial services. A bank account also forms the basis for saving and access to credit.\nImmigrants in the Central Valley face significant barriers to opening a bank account, and\ntraditional approaches to reaching new customers are unlikely to succeed. Tapping into\nthis market will require a sophisticated understanding of each community’s financial\nservices needs. There are likely to be significant differences in the financial practices of\nHmong refugees and recent immigrants from Mexico, for example. And it will require\ninnovative partnerships with organizations that can serve as “trusted advisors” in these\ncommunities, helping to educate consumers about their financial choices. The pilot\nprojects being undertaken in communities like Newman, Patterson, and Parlier can serve\nas important models for financial institutions trying to understand these rural markets and\nprovide insights into effective strategies for reaching the unbanked.\nI also encourage you to see this effort to reach the unbanked as part of a wider strategy of\nasset building. The partnerships and outreach strategies you develop in providing\nimmigrants financial access can also be leveraged to connect low-income families to\nother opportunities. For example, how can you capitalize on these partnerships to raise\nawareness of the Earned Income Tax Credit? Every year, approximately 20 million\nlower-income households receive tax refunds through the EITC. The average EITC\n15 For a more detailed description of this partnership, see “Supporting Hispanic Entrepreneurs in the Central\nValley,” Community Investments 18(1). The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco: San Francisco, CA.\n\nrefund is around $1,700; some are as high as $4,000. The EITC is now the largest federal\nprogram to help the working poor, and it removes more children from poverty than any\nother single federal program.16 Yet, we know that in the Central Valley a large\npercentage of families eligible for the EITC fail to claim it. What approaches might be\nneeded to help more eligible families claim this important credit? Similarly, how can you\nwork with other organizations to help combat the spread of predatory lending and\nmortgage fraud in your communities? What opportunities are there to provide financial\neducation and raise awareness about the risks and rewards of credit? I am confident that\nthe ideas and partnerships that you develop in forums like these will help to answer these\ncritical questions.\nIn conclusion, I would like to underscore how important your work is to the strength of\nthe communities of the Valley. I encourage you to continue working together to help\nprovide increased economic opportunity in your communities, and I wish you the best of\nluck in your efforts. I look forward to my next visit, and to learning more about your\nsuccesses. Thank you.\n# # #\n16 David Francis (2006 ) The Earned Income Tax Credit Raises Employment.

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Strong Foundations: The Economic Futures of Kids and Communities,” the\n10th Biennial Federal Reserve System Community Development Research Conference\nWashington, D.C.\nMarch 23, 2017\n\nI would like to welcome all of you and thank you for joining us to discuss a set of\ntopics of considerable importance to our country. This is the Federal Reserve’s 10th\nbiennial community development research conference, dedicated as always to issues of\nsignificance to people and communities around the country. The conference is\ncosponsored by, and includes substantive contributions from, the community\ndevelopment offices of all 12 Federal Reserve Banks as well as the Board of Governors.\nThat united effort and level of commitment reflects how consequential we consider these\nissues to be. This conference is intended to present and highlight rigorous research that I\nam confident will inform how you think about your own work, whether from the\nperspective of policymaking, community development practice, or research.\nOur last conference, two years ago, explored various aspects of economic\nmobility, largely among adults. This year, we gather to discuss “The Economic Futures\nof Kids and Communities,” and, in part, I see this topic as an extension of that earlier\nconversation about mobility.\nToday and tomorrow, we focus on research about the foundation or building\nblocks for economic success that are laid even before young people enter the workforce\nand assume responsibility for their own finances.\nWe will hear from leading experts on a range of issues related to how children,\nyouths, and young adults are shaped in ways that may ultimately affect their ability later\nto productively contribute to the economy and manage their finances. We can learn from\nwhat the data and analysis tell us, and our hope is that making use of this information will\nlead to more effective programs and policies and thus better outcomes.\n\n- 2 -\nConsiderable evidence shows that growing up poor makes it harder to succeed as\nan adult, and new research by the Fed likewise shows the strong connection between the\ntypical experiences of poverty in childhood and economic challenges later as an adult.\nThe data come from the Board’s latest Survey of Household Economics and\nDecisionmaking (SHED), which will be published later this spring.1 In the most recent\nsurvey, we asked some of the younger respondents--aged 25 to 39--to think about their\nchildhoods. We asked those young adults whether, during their childhoods, they found\nthemselves worrying about having enough food to eat, having a stable caregiver, or about\ntheir personal safety. About 10 percent said they regularly worried about one or more of\nthese concerns, and an additional 19 percent said they sometimes worried about them.\nWe were then able to compare responses about their experiences in childhood to\nwhat these young adults told us about their current circumstances. Some pretty clear\npatterns emerged. Of those young adults who regularly had one or more of these\nchildhood concerns growing up, more than one-half say that they are currently facing\nchallenges in getting by financially. This fraction compares to just over one-fourth of\nthose who said they never, or only rarely, worried about these concerns as children that\nnow experience this level of financial challenge. Young adults who regularly or\nsometimes worried when they were children about their care, safety, or having enough to\neat are also less likely to be employed, less likely to have consistent income month-to-\n1 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (forthcoming), 2016 Survey of Household Economics\nand Decisionmaking (Washington: Board of Governors). Past SHED surveys are available on the Board’s\nwebsite at https://www.federalreserve.gov/communitydev/shed.htm, which is also where the 2016 survey\nwill be posted when completed.\n\n- 3 -\nmonth, and less likely to be able to pay all of their current monthly bills in full, compared\nwith those who never or rarely worried about these concerns as children.2\nBroadly speaking, children who grow up in insecure circumstances, those often\nexperienced in poverty, seem disproportionately likely to experience financial insecurity\nas adults. This conference is about understanding what kinds of environments and\nresources can best help children meet with economic success after they reach adulthood.\nThere has been a lot of discussion in the aftermath of the Great Recession about how to\nbest connect people with steady jobs. But research presented over the next two days\nmakes a compelling case that there is a need to also think longer term about how to\nprepare people for success in the labor market. In fact, this research underscores the\nvalue of starting young to develop basic work habits and skills, like literacy, numeracy,\nand interpersonal and organizational skills. These habits and skills help prepare people\nfor work, help them enter the labor market sooner, meet with more success over time, and\nbe in a position to develop the more specialized skills and obtain the academic credentials\nthat are strongly correlated with higher and steadier earnings. Indeed, a growing body of\neconomic and education literature has focused on the relative efficiency of addressing\nworkforce development challenges through investments in early childhood development\nand education compared with interventions later in life.\nI believe that data, evidence, and research can help policymakers and practitioners\nthink more clearly about the implications for improving economic and life outcomes for\neveryone. To this end, the speakers at this conference will focus on three broad issues. I\n2 See note 1.\n\n- 4 -\nwould like to briefly mention each, highlighting some of the questions that I believe can\nbe informed by the research that will be presented here.\nFirst, this morning’s panel will address early childhood development and\neducation. In recent years, medicine and social science has revealed more than we ever\nhave known before about which factors and experiences in childhood can make a\ndifference later in life. However, many questions demand further attention. A\nfundamental one is how positive developmental outcomes can be promoted among those\nwho were not born into families with socioeconomic advantages. While we do know\nthere are advantages to good quality early childhood education, we should strive to better\nunderstand what kind of returns on investment this education provides and how to\nmaximize these returns. The answers to these questions may influence thinking about\nhow programs and interventions meant to assist kids and their families should be\nstructured for maximum effectiveness to help put kids on the road to economic success.\nSecond, researchers have explored the effects of neighborhoods and community\nconditions on the development of young people. Some presenters at this conference will\nshare their understanding of how physical surroundings influence personal development.\nFor instance, how do the form and quality of community institutions such as schools,\ncommunity centers, and libraries play a role? What other kinds of community\ncharacteristics--such as public safety, transportation, and environmental quality--might\nhelp or hinder general education and financial skill development? A particularly\nimportant question is how kids’ home environments affect them in ways that matter for\ntheir future economic success. It is also critically important to ask, what kinds of\ninterventions have proven track records, and are these programs scalable?\n\n- 5 -\nThird, and finally, other presenters will explore issues around skill development\nof youths and young adults, workforce outcomes, and the implications for the broader\neconomy. They will ask how we understand which formative experiences most affect the\nability of young people to successfully move to the next chapter in their lives, whether\nthat means college, a job, or other paths such as self-employment. What role does a\nrange of programs--starting with early childhood education all the way through youth\nvocational or apprenticeship training--play in affecting job readiness? How effective are\ndifferent approaches, and what are the returns on investment? We should also pay\nattention to how well young people form the sorts of “soft skills”--things like teamwork,\ncommunication, and the ability to handle conflict--that are so valued by employers. And,\nfor young people whose paths become difficult, such as those who get caught up in the\njuvenile justice system, what effect do such experiences have on their futures as workers\nand consumers, and what are the most promising approaches to foster a course\ncorrection?\nI hope that the data and other evidence presented today and tomorrow are of use\nto you in your work. Community development professionals attending this conference\nmay consider how the design and implementation of their programs may be improved.\nPolicymakers may look more closely at how kids are affected--purposefully or\nunintentionally--by public policies. And researchers may encounter ideas that spark new\nwork that can shed further light on these important topics.\nI think it is important that we better understand these issues, and I applaud you for\ntaking the time to be here to share your knowledge and to learn. Our young people are\nthe future, and we all want them to have the support they need for successful and\n\n- 6 -\nfulfilling lives. As a central banker, I recognize the benefits to the broader economy\nwhen more people are better prepared for work and for managing their finances. In short,\nensuring that all of our kids have “strong foundations” will help build a similarly strong\nfoundation for the U.S. economy.",

    "text": "Presentation to the Haas Business School, University of California, Berkeley\nDean’s Speaker Series\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on May 5, 2009, 7:30 PM Pacific time, 10:30 PM Eastern\nIssues Raised by the Credit Crunch and Global Recession1\nI’m delighted to be with you at the Haas School and be hosted by my friend Rich Lyons.\nAs you know, this is a homecoming for me. I spent almost 25 rewarding years of my\nprofessional life as a faculty member here. And I will always think of the Haas and broader\nBerkeley communities with great fondness. Now, of course, I am with the Federal Reserve, and\nthat’s another institution that means a great deal to me because it’s a place where many of the\nideas and issues that were central to both my teaching and research here at Haas are translated\ninto real-world policy. The decisions we make at the Fed have taken on added significance with\nthe nation and most of the world going through a deep and worrisome recession, one that has\ncaused millions of people to lose their jobs or homes, and threatened or destroyed businesses\nlarge and small.\nI think the most useful thing I can do tonight is to give you my views on the current\neconomic situation and then examine some key issues that will shape the course of the economy\nas we try to dig out from a very deep hole. The story I’m going to tell involves many\ncrosscurrents and uncertainties. This murky picture may actually be good news. I’ve spent the\nlast year or so being so downbeat that I could actually see the faces in my audiences sink as I\nspoke. The fact that I can now talk about crosscurrents may mean that the economy is reaching\nan inflection point. It’s too soon for me to be convinced of that, and I see a lot of downside risk,\nbut at least there is some basis for optimism. That said, I expect the recovery, whenever it does\n1 I would like to thank John Judd and Sam Zuckerman for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n1\n\nbegin, to be quite gradual compared with those following previous deep recessions. As always,\nmy comments represent my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal\nReserve System.\nThe recession is now in its sixth quarter and it’s shaping up as the most severe downturn\nsince the Great Depression. Last week we found out that real GDP contracted at an annual rate\nof slightly more than 6 percent in the first quarter, according to the Commerce Department’s\nadvance estimate. That is about the same pace of decline registered in the final quarter of last\nyear. These are the largest consecutive declines in real GDP since 1958. The recession is also\nvery broad-based. Housing, business fixed investment, exports, and imports are all falling at\neye-popping rates—down more than 30 percent each. The one sector that held up surprisingly\nwell in the first quarter is the largest—consumer spending—which rose by a respectable 2¼\npercent.\nWhether this is a harbinger of good things to come is uncertain, in part because, after\nadjusting for inflation, consumption slowed over the months of the quarter and declined\nabsolutely in March. Still, it does offer a glimmer of hope. In addition, business inventories fell\nby a very large amount in the first quarter. That too is a positive signal. When spending\ncontracted last year, inventories ballooned relative to sales and firms have been struggling to\nbring them into better alignment. The first-quarter data suggest that the necessary inventory\ncorrection may be quite far along. Recent data also offer some hints of stabilization in the\nhousing sector. Home construction contracted sharply in the first quarter as a whole, but we saw\nsigns of improvement late in the period. In the past couple of months, home sales and housing\n2\n\nstarts have leveled off. Meanwhile, depending on the index, home prices have either increased\nslightly or fallen at a slower pace.\nWhile output is at least showing potential for improvement going forward, recent news\nfrom the labor market is still very weak. The unemployment rate has risen by 1.7 percentage\npoints over the past four months and, as bad as that is, I think it actually understates the true\nmagnitude of the labor market deterioration. For one thing, the incidence of permanent, as\nopposed to temporary, layoffs is unusually high compared with past downturns. In addition,\ninvoluntary part-time work has increased during this recession far more than we would expect\nrelative to the rise in unemployment. My business contacts tell me, and the data confirm, that the\nuse of furloughs is now widespread. I know that they are under consideration here at Berkeley as\na way to address the budget crunch. The result is that nationally, we have seen a surge in part-\ntime work for economic reasons occurring broadly across occupations. The underemployment\nrate, a broad measure that adds individuals working part time for economic reasons to the\nunemployed, now stands at 14¼ percent. This is a whopping 6½ percentage points higher than at\nthe start of the recession, nearly twice the increase in the standard unemployment rate.\nLooking forward, my personal forecast for output growth is similar to the Blue Chip\nconsensus. I believe the most likely scenario is that real GDP will advance at a low, but positive,\nrate in the second half of this year followed by trend-like growth in 2010. A forecast that the\neconomy will soon switch from contraction to expansion strikes some people as optimistic. But,\nit takes less than you might think for real GDP growth rates to turn positive. Positive growth\nbecomes likely if some of the economy’s weak sectors stop dragging down GDP going forward.\nResidential construction in particular has been declining for several years, subtracting about 1\n3\n\npercentage point from real GDP growth. This spending can sink only so far, and, as I said,\nwe’ve seen some tentative signs of stabilization recently. If housing starts level out, the sector\nwould no longer weigh down the economy and faster growth would ensue. Similarly, as I noted\nearlier, inventory liquidation has been unusually severe in recent months, especially in motor\nvehicles. A reduction in the pace of liquidation also would raise the GDP growth rate. Finally,\nif consumers become more confident—and there is evidence from surveys that they have\nrecently—pent-up demand actually could boost spending on autos, durable goods, and even\nhousing, providing some real “juice” to economic growth.\nOf course, monetary and fiscal policy are also sharply focused on promoting economic\nrecovery. On the monetary side, the Federal Reserve has pushed its traditional policy lever—the\nfederal funds rate—close to zero. And we haven’t stopped there. We have put in place an array\nof unconventional approaches to spur the flow of credit to households and businesses. These\ninclude measures to improve liquidity and financial market functioning, and facilities to support\nthe issuance of asset-backed securities. Moreover, we are undertaking large-scale purchases of\nTreasury and agency-related debt. These initiatives appear to be lowering longer-term interest\nrates and easing financial conditions more generally. Mortgage and other private borrowing\nrates have fallen, and, as those who’ve been bold enough to open their 401(k) statements again\nwill attest, stock prices have risen: they’re up around 35 percent from the lows reached in March.\nWe’ve also seen improvements in key measures of financial market functioning, such as spreads\nof Libor over the expected federal funds rate. On the fiscal side, the stimulus package passed by\nCongress in February will provide an important economic shot in the arm. While the program\ndoes not appear large enough to solve the economy’s problems on its own, the support it will\n4\n\nprovide to aggregate demand is significant and helpful. We will likely begin seeing its effects on\nthe economy this quarter.\nSo, to summarize, I am hopeful that the recession will end in the second half of this year\ndue to aggressive monetary and fiscal policies, and the operation of typical business cycle\nmechanisms, such as inventory dynamics. Unfortunately, this combination of ingredients is not a\nrecipe for a resounding rebound. My forecast that output growth will turn positive in 2009 and\nproceed near trend in 2010 implies that the unemployment rate will rise from 8½ percent now to\naround 9½ percent by the end of this year, and remain at about that level through 2010. An\nimplication is that inflation is likely to decline below the 2 percent pace that I and most of my\ncolleagues consider most consistent with our congressional mandate to strive for full\nemployment and price stability. Substantial slack in labor and product markets combined with\nlower commodity prices is already restraining overall price increases for goods and services. If,\nas seems likely, this downward pressure continues, core consumer inflation is apt to fall from\nabout 2 percent last year to around 1½ percent this year, and go even lower in 2010. I’ll have\nmore to say about inflation later.\nThe forecast I just described implies that I am not in the ranks of those who believe that\n“V” is the letter that will best describe the economy’s trajectory going forward. Those who\nanticipate a V-shaped recovery argue that growth in the first year after a business-cycle trough\nhas typically been very rapid in previous U.S. downturns, including the deep recession that\noccurred in 1981 and 82. My own forecast, in contrast, implies a far less robust recovery. In my\nview, the explanation for the V-shaped pattern typical of past recessions relates to monetary\npolicy. Most deep recessions in the postwar era happened after the Fed tightened policy to fight\n5\n\ninflation. Once the inflation scare passed, the central bank was able to cut its policy rate sharply,\nand the economy snapped back. But, of course, the current recession is far different, having been\ntriggered by a historic housing bust, and a banking and financial crisis. Carmen Reinhart and\nKen Rogoff have compared recessions around the world and shown that it takes a long time to\nrecover from downturns caused by financial crises. 2 And that is what I expect this time as well.\nI can point to a number of specific factors in this recession that are likely to weaken\nrecovery. First, despite signs that consumer spending is stabilizing, the chance of strong and\nsustained consumption growth appears low. For years prior to the recession, households went on\na spending spree of major proportions. This occurred during what has come to be called the\n“great moderation,” a period of about two decades when recessions were infrequent and mild,\nand inflation was low and stable. This may have lulled households into a false sense of security.\nThe personal saving rate fell from around 8 percent two decades ago to almost zero in recent\nyears as households financed their lifestyles by drawing on increasing stock market and housing\nwealth, and taking on higher levels of debt.\nNow, the era of such low saving may be over. Falling house and stock prices have\nvaporized trillions of dollars in household wealth. The destruction of their nest eggs is\nprompting households to rebuild savings. The deleveraging of household balance sheets could\nrestrain spending for years. Indeed, the personal saving rate is finally on the rise, averaging\nmore than 4 percent so far this year. It wouldn’t surprise me if this effect persists, as the shock\nof the financial crisis convinces many households that they need to save higher fractions of their\nincomes for the long term. Of course, ultimately this would be good for economic growth,\n2 Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff, “Is the 2007 Sub-Prime Financial Crisis So Different? An\nInternational Historical Comparison,” unpublished manuscript, February 5, 2008.\nhttp://www.economics.harvard.edu/files/faculty/51_Is_The_US_Subprime_Crisis_So_Different.pdf\n6\n\nchanneling resources from consumption to investment. That said, the transition could be painful\nif subpar consumption growth restrains the pace of economic recovery.\nMeanwhile, the story for banks and other financial firms is eerily similar. In the buildup\nto the recession, financial institutions, like consumers, became highly leveraged. Their\nvulnerability was compounded because they often invested in complex and risky assets that were\nfunded with short-term debt. Since the crisis hit, in an attempt to increase the soundness of their\nindividual balance sheets, banks have tightened lending standards, trying to improve credit\nquality at the same time that rising unemployment and falling house prices have led to more\ncredit losses. The attempts by banks to cut back the volume of their assets to reduce leverage\nand conserve capital, combined with a breakdown in the flow of lending through securitization,\nhas constricted the provision of credit in the economy. One important purpose of the stress tests,\nnow nearing completion by banking regulators, is to ensure that our largest banking\norganizations establish capital buffers that are large enough for them to withstand losses, while\ncontinuing to provide credit to households and businesses, even if the recession turns out to be\nsignificantly worse than currently anticipated. Such lending is critical to recovery.\nThe challenges facing monetary policy makers are another factor that makes a strong\nrecovery uncertain. With the federal funds rate essentially at zero, the Fed’s traditional policy\ntool has reached its maximum degree of accommodation. Many versions of the Taylor rule, a\nwell-known policy benchmark, indicate that we ought to lower the funds rate well below this\nzero bound, if such a thing were possible. As I noted, the Fed has turned to unconventional\npolicy tools. Through a variety of programs, the Fed has augmented the flow of credit to the\neconomy, provided a reliable source of liquidity to the financial system, and helped prevent the\n7\n\nfailure of systemically important depository and nondepository institutions. Most of the action\nrecently has involved boosting credit flows through large-scale asset purchases. To support the\nhousing sector, the Fed announced last November that it would start buying agency-insured\nmortgage-backed securities (MBS) and agency debt. In March, this program was expanded\nsubstantially. In addition, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) launched a new\nprogram to purchase large quantities of longer-term Treasury debt. These asset purchases have\nthe potential to stimulate aggregate demand through a number of channels, most obviously by\nreducing yields on securities included in the program. Indeed, when the FOMC announced in\nMarch that the Fed would expand these purchases, interest rates declined on both Treasury\nsecurities and agency-backed MBS. Still, even though these programs appear to be having a\nuseful effect, we have little experience with them and the magnitude of their impact is uncertain.\nIn other words, it is difficult to tell if unconventional monetary policies will be as effective in\npromoting recovery as easing the funds rate has been in the past.\nFinally, the global nature of the recession is likely to hold back the pace of our recovery.\nWe haven’t seen anything like this global downturn since the Great Depression. Virtually all\nadvanced economies and many emerging economies are in recession. Financial systems around\nthe globe are under stress, housing markets in some countries have collapsed, and trade has\nshriveled. The International Monetary Fund recently forecast that the global economy would\nrecover very gradually. This makes sense. As I said, recessions caused by financial crises are\ngenerally followed by more measured upswings. In addition, when recessions occur in many\nregions simultaneously, recoveries are slower than when downturns are confined to just a few\n8\n\ncountries.3 Now we have a double whammy—a highly synchronized global recession and a\nfinancial crisis. That’s a daunting combination.\nFor all of these reasons—the need for balance sheet repair by households and financial\nfirms, uncertainties about unconventional monetary policy tools, and the global nature of the\nrecession—I expect the U.S. recovery to be frustratingly tepid once it does get started. It likely\nwill take several more years to bring unemployment back to its long-run equilibrium value.\nAs we think about the course of the economy, we must also be wary of developments that\ncould derail recovery. I see the economy as vulnerable to a number of downside risks, including\nthe possibility of another disruptive financial event—another “shoe” dropping, if you will.\nCommercial real estate is an area that seems vulnerable. Nonresidential construction declined\nsharply in the first quarter as business activity slowed; new buildings came on line; vacancy rates\non office, industrial, and retail space rose; and property values fell. For developers, financing is\nextremely hard to get. The market for commercial MBS has all but dried up and banks are\ntightening lending standards. Many developers will have trouble rolling over debt when it comes\ndue. Banks—especially community banks—are major lenders to this sector and are vulnerable\nto losses.\nWe must also keep an eye on developing nations, which face stark challenges as markets\nfor their products shrink and capital inflows dry up. Emerging market defaults could trigger\nfurther financial turmoil. The downturn in eastern Europe poses especially significant financial\nrisks to western European banks, whose exposure amounts to an estimated $1.5 trillion. With\n3 International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook, April 2009.\nhttp://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2009/01/index.htm\n9\n\nconfidence in the global financial system already fragile, these problems easily could spill over\nto the United States.\nAnother risk I’d like to discuss is inflation—or perhaps I should say deflation. This is an\nextraordinary time when you can hear a warning about inflation from one quarter and a dire\nprediction of deflation from another quarter. I hear from both sides, though more often from\nthose worried about inflation. Concerns about an inflationary surge focus on the expansion of\nthe Fed’s balance sheet, which has increased from under $900 billion in mid-2007 to over $2\ntrillion now, largely financed by increases in bank reserves. The inflation worriers may be\nfocused on these excess reserves as a potential source of inflation down the road. Their fears are\ncompounded because federal budget deficits are ballooning. While I understand that the\ncombination of Fed expansion and big federal budget deficits might seem scary, I don’t see a\nsurge in inflation as very likely. Expansionary monetary policy creates inflation by loosening\nfinancial conditions enough to create excess demand for goods and services. That’s obviously\nnot the problem we face now. In spite of the Fed’s best efforts to enhance the flow of credit,\nfinancial conditions, while somewhat improved, overall remain abnormally tight. In our current\nrecession, we need more demand—not less—to offset the slack in labor and product markets.\nThat said, in theory there’s one way inflation could rise before the economy recovers\nfrom the recession: inflation expectations might increase because of fears that the Fed will not\nshift gears quickly enough when the recession and credit crunch are over. Some people have\nargued that the Fed might find it politically difficult to stop lending to the private sector\nborrowers it has supported during the crisis.4 I don’t find this argument persuasive and I don’t\n4 Jeffrey Lacker, “Government Lending and Monetary Policy,” remarks to the National Association for Business\nEconomics, 2009 Washington Economic Policy Conference, Alexandria, VA, March 2, 2009\n10\n\nsee evidence that the broad public finds it convincing either. The Fed has accumulated\nconsiderable anti-inflation credibility over the past 25 years or so.5 This credibility was evident\na few years ago when prices for energy, food, and other commodities soared to historically high\nlevels. While the direct effects of those price increases showed up in headline consumer\ninflation, very little was passed through to core inflation. Right now, there’s little evidence that\ninflation expectations have deteriorated. Market indicators and survey measures of longer-run\nexpectations have been quite stable.\nOf course, the inflation worriers are correct in an important respect: The Federal Reserve\nwill need to remove monetary accommodation once the credit crunch eases, private spending\nrevives, and the economy picks up steam. If the Fed were to fail to tighten the stance of\nmonetary policy quickly enough, we would see higher inflation. But I want to assure you that\nthe Fed is well aware of this danger and is readying the tools even now. Most importantly, the\nFed is committed to maintaining price stability and, when the time to remove accommodation\ncomes, we have a number of tools in our kit bag that could be quite effective.\nThe simplest approach—the one that we have used traditionally—would be to shrink our\nbalance sheet by selling the Treasuries, agency debt, and agency MBS we accumulated during\nthe crisis. Many of the special liquidity and credit facilities we have developed will be phased\nout as financial markets recover. But it is conceivable that, even with the economy rebounding\nnicely, the credit crunch might not be fully behind us and some financial markets might still need\n(http://www.richmondfed.org/press_room/speeches/president_jeff_lacker/2009/lacker_speech_20090302.cfm); and\nCharles I.

In this case, we could increase the interest rate we pay on bank reserves. This\nwould induce banks to remove funds from the federal funds market and lend them to us, thereby\nincreasing the federal funds rate and longer-term interest rates that are more relevant to private\nborrowers. Importantly, this approach provides us with the flexibility to tighten monetary policy\nin response to an improving macroeconomic picture without shrinking the size of our balance\nsheet or our support to financial markets. It is the main method employed by many central banks\nto influence financial conditions. An alternative approach that could accomplish the same goal,\nand perhaps do it better, would be something completely new for the Federal Reserve—that’s to\nissue interest-bearing debt broadly to private investors. Let’s call this debt Fed bills. Congress\nwould have to authorize this, but it too is a tool available to many central banks. The sale of Fed\nbills would reduce the reserves of the banking system, as in a typical contractionary open-market\noperation. As with interest on reserves, we could accomplish a tightening of policy while\nmaintaining our support of credit markets. But Fed bills would have an advantage over interest\non reserves. The loans to the Fed would come from investors throughout the economy, not just\nfrom banks. At a time when we need banks to lend to the private sector to fight a credit crunch,\nthis is a decided plus.\nAs you can tell, I’m quite skeptical about the risk of higher inflation. My thoughts about\nthe possibility of deflation are more complex. At first blush, there is cause for concern. We are\nstarting from a situation where core inflation is already a bit below 2 percent. The economy has\na great deal of slack and unemployment is likely to rise further, which would put more\ndownward pressure on wage growth and inflation. Indeed, we have already seen evidence that\nwages are rising less rapidly and there have been some outright wage cuts. Furthermore, as I\nnoted, with the funds rate at the zero bound, monetary policy has been forced to ease its stance\n12\n\nthrough unconventional instruments that are hardly tried and true. If deflation were to occur with\nthe funds rate near zero, the effects could be severe. In the textbook case, with no way of\nlowering the nominal funds rate, real interest rates would rise as prices fell. That could drive the\neconomy into a spiral of larger and larger price decreases, with economic activity sinking more\nand more.\nThe risk of such a deflationary spiral depends crucially on the nature of inflation\nexpectations.6 If expectations are unanchored, meaning that people have variable expectations\ndepending on the recent behavior of inflation, then the lower inflation that’s characteristic of\nrecessions can convince them that inflation will go still lower in the future. If a recession is\nsevere and long enough, this process eventually will cause prices to fall, and then create a\ndownward spiral. But I don’t think this is a likely scenario in the United States. I believe that\ninflation expectations are well anchored, in the sense that people expect inflation to be consistent\nwith the Feds’ goals and policies. Based on measures of inflation expectations, people appear to\nthink we will take policy actions that will maintain a positive rate of inflation. This expectation\nacts as a buttress holding inflation up. This does not mean that a short episode of deflation\ncouldn’t occur, but it does help to avoid a prolonged deflationary spiral.\nTo reinforce our commitment to price stability, the FOMC recently began releasing long-\nrun inflation forecasts based on the assumption of appropriate monetary policy. These figures,\nwhich indicate where FOMC members would like inflation to settle in the longer run, show, as I\nmentioned, a consensus of 2 percent for consumer inflation.7 Such words, backed by appropriate\n6 John C. Williams, “The Risk of Deflation,” FRBSF Economic Letter 2009-12 (March 27, 2009).\nhttp://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2009/el2009-12.html\n7 The price index for personal consumption expenditures is used for this calculation.\n13\n\nactions, help keep inflation expectations well anchored and reduce the chances of a deflationary\nspiral. So, for me the bottom line is this: I see little basis to worry that we will develop an\ninflation problem. There is more of a reason to think that we could experience some deflation,\nbut the chances of a severe bout of that ailment seem remote.\nYou may have gotten a case of whiplash hearing me say that, although conditions are\npoor, some hopeful signs are visible, but significant risks remain. Your necks may not have felt\nany better when I said that I hear worries about inflation and deflation at the same time.\nHowever, that’s the situation we find ourselves in now. The good news is that, for the first time\nin a while, there is some good news to savor. But, when it comes to assessing the future of the\neconomy, the dominant theme is uncertainty. The one thing that is sure is that policymakers\naround the globe are working hard to restore economic growth. As for the Federal Reserve, it\nremains fully committed to doing everything in its power to foster recovery while maintaining\nprice stability.\n14",

Minsky Conference on the State of the U.S. and\nWorld Economies—“Meeting the Challenges of the Financial Crisis”\nOrganized by the Levy Economics Institute of Bard College\nNew York City\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on April 16, 2009, 8:00 PM Eastern Time, 5:00 PM Pacific\nA Minsky Meltdown:\nLessons for Central Bankers1\nIt’s a great pleasure to speak to this distinguished group at a conference named for\nHyman P. Minsky. My last talk here took place 13 years ago when I served on the Fed’s Board\nof Governors. My topic then was “The ‘New’ Science of Credit Risk Management at Financial\nInstitutions.” It described innovations that I expected to improve the measurement and\nmanagement of risk. My talk today is titled “A Minsky Meltdown: Lessons for Central\nBankers.” I won’t dwell on the irony of that. Suffice it to say that, with the financial world in\nturmoil, Minsky’s work has become required reading. It is getting the recognition it richly\ndeserves. The dramatic events of the past year and a half are a classic case of the kind of\nsystemic breakdown that he—and relatively few others—envisioned.\nCentral to Minsky’s view of how financial meltdowns occur, of course, are “asset price\nbubbles.” This evening I will revisit the ongoing debate over whether central banks should act to\ncounter such bubbles and discuss “lessons learned.” This issue seems especially compelling now\nthat it’s evident that episodes of exuberance, like the ones that led to our bond and house price\nbubbles, can be time bombs that cause catastrophic damage to the economy when they explode.\nIndeed, in view of the financial mess we’re living through, I found it fascinating to read Minsky\n1 I would like to thank John Judd and Sam Zuckerman for exceptional assistance in preparing these remarks.\n1\n\nagain and reexamine my own views about central bank responses to speculative financial booms.\nMy thoughts on this have changed somewhat, as I will explain.2\nAs always, my comments are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my\ncolleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nMinsky and the current crisis\nOne of the critical features of Minsky’s world view is that borrowers, lenders, and\nregulators are lulled into complacency as asset prices rise.3 It was not so long ago—though it\nseems like a lifetime—that many of us were trying to figure out why investors were demanding\nso little compensation for risk. For example, long-term interest rates were well below what\nappeared consistent with the expected future path of short-term rates. This phenomenon, which\nended abruptly in mid-2007, was famously characterized by then-Chairman Greenspan as a\n“conundrum.”4 Credit spreads too were razor thin. But for Minsky, this behavior of interest\nrates and loan pricing might not have been so puzzling. He might have pointed out that such a\nsense of safety on the part of investors is characteristic of financial booms. The incaution that\nreigned by the middle of this decade had been fed by roughly twenty years of the so-called “great\nmoderation,” when most industrialized economies experienced steady growth and low and stable\ninflation. Moreover, the world economy had shaken off the effects of the bursting of an earlier\nasset price bubble—the technology stock boom—with comparatively little damage.\n2 I want to give credit to PIMCO’s always-astute Paul McCulley—who gave last year’s keynote address—for\nleading the Minsky revival and pointing out the relevance of Minsky’s work to our current financial troubles.\n3 For example, see Hyman P. Minsky, “The Financial Instability Hypothesis,” The Jerome Levy Economics Institute\nof Bard College, Working Paper No. 74, May 1992 (http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=161024);\nand Robert Pollin, “The Relevance of Hyman Minsky,” Challenge, March/April 1997.\n4 Alan Greenspan, “Federal Reserve Board’s semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress,” testimony\nbefore the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, February 16, 2005.\n(http://www.federalreserve.gov/Boarddocs/hh/2005/february/testimony.htm)\n2\n\nChairman Bernanke has argued that other factors besides complacency were responsible\nfor low interest rates in this period.5 A glut of foreign saving mainly generated in developing\ncountries such as China and India fueled demand for dollar-denominated assets. This ample\nsupply of foreign savings combined with a low U.S. personal saving rate, large U.S. government\ndeficits, and high productivity gains to produce a huge current account deficit. As a result, vast\nquantities of funds began “sloshing around” in our economy seeking investment projects.\nFed monetary policy may also have contributed to the U.S. credit boom and the\nassociated house price bubble by maintaining a highly accommodative stance from 2002 to\n2004.6 This accommodative stance was motivated by what Greenspan called “risk management\npolicy,” in which, to reduce the possibility of deflation, the funds rate was held below the level\nthat would otherwise have been chosen to promote a return to full employment.7 In effect, the\nFed took a calculated risk. It took out some insurance to lower the chances of a potentially\ndevastating deflationary episode. The cost of that insurance was an increased possibility of\noverheating the economy. These policy actions arguably played some role in our house price\nbubble. But they clearly were not the only factor, since such bubbles appeared in many countries\nthat did not have highly accommodative monetary policies.\nAs Minsky’s financial instability hypothesis suggests, when optimism is high and ample\nfunds are available for investment, investors tend to migrate from the safe hedge end of the\nMinsky spectrum to the risky speculative and Ponzi end. Indeed, in the current episode,\n5 Ben S. Bernanke, “The Global Saving Glut and the U.S. Current Account Deficit,” remarks at the Sandridge\nLecture, Virginia Association of Economics, Richmond, Virginia, March 10, 2005.\n(http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/200503102/)\n6 John B. Taylor, “The Financial Crisis and the Policy Responses: An Empirical Analysis of What Went Wrong,”\nNBER Working Paper No. 14631, January 2009. (http://www.nber.org/papers/w14631)\n7 Alan Greenspan, “Monetary Policy under Uncertainty,” remarks at a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve\nBank of Kansas City, Jackson Hole, Wyoming, August 29, 2003.\n(http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2003/20030829/default.htm)\n3\n\ninvestors tried to raise returns by increasing leverage and sacrificing liquidity through short-\nterm—sometimes overnight—debt financing. Simultaneously, new and fancy methods of\nfinancial engineering allowed widespread and complex securitization of many types of assets,\nmost famously in subprime lending. In addition, exotic derivatives, such as credit default swaps,\nwere thought to dilute risk by spreading it widely. These new financial products provided the\nbasis for an illusion of low risk, a misconception that was amplified by the inaccurate analyses of\nthe rating agencies. This created a new wrinkle that even Minsky may not have imagined. Some\nof the investors who put money into highly risky assets were blithely unaware of how far out on\na limb they had gone. Many of those who thought they were in the hedge category were shocked\nto discover that, in fact, they were speculative or Ponzi units.\nAt the same time, securitization added distance between borrowers and lenders. As a\nresult, underwriting standards were significantly relaxed. Much of this financing was done in\nthe “shadow banking system,” consisting of entities that acted a lot like banks—albeit very\nhighly leveraged and illiquid banks—but were outside the bank regulatory net. Although these\ndevelopments reached an extreme state in the U.S. subprime mortgage market, risky practices\nwere employed broadly in the U.S. financial system. And this activity extended far beyond our\nborders as players throughout the global financial system eagerly participated. As banks and\ntheir large, nonbank competitors became involved in ever more complicated securitizations, they\nbegan to employ sophisticated “new tools” to measure and manage the credit risks flowing from\nthese transactions. But those tools—which I described in my speech 13 years ago—proved\ninsufficient for the task.\nThis cult of risky behavior was not limited to financial institutions. U.S. households\nenthusiastically leveraged themselves to the hilt. The personal saving rate, which had been\n4\n\nfalling for over a decade, hovered only slightly above zero from mid-2005 to mid-2007. A good\ndeal of this leverage came in the form of mortgage debt. The vast use of exotic mortgages—such\nas subprime, interest-only, low-doc and no-doc, and option-ARMs—offers an example of\nMinsky’s Ponzi finance, in which a loan can only be refinanced if the price of the underlying\nasset increases. In fact, many subprime loans were explicitly designed to be good for the\nborrower only if they could be refinanced at a lower rate, a benefit limited to those who\nestablished a pattern of regular payments and built reasonable equity in their homes.\nIn retrospect, it’s not surprising that these developments led to unsustainable increases in\nbond prices and house prices. Once those prices started to go down, we were quickly in the\nmidst of a Minsky meltdown. The financial engineering that was thought to hedge risks\nprobably would have worked beautifully if individual investors had faced shocks that were\nuncorrelated with those of their counterparties. But declines in bond and house prices hit\neveryone in the same way, inflicting actual and expected credit losses broadly across the\nfinancial system. Moreover, the complexity of securitized credit instruments meant that it was\ndifficult to identify who the actual loan holders might be. Meanwhile, asset write-downs reduced\nequity cushions of financial firms and increased their leverage just when growing risks made\nthose firms seek less leverage, not more. When they tried to sell assets into illiquid markets,\nprices fell further, generating yet more selling pressure in a loss spiral that kept intensifying. We\nexperienced a “perfect storm” in financial markets: runs on highly vulnerable and systemically\nimportant financial institutions; dysfunction in most securitized credit markets; a reduction in\ninterbank lending; higher interest rates for all but the safest borrowers, matched by near-zero\nyields on Treasury bills; lower equity values; and a restricted supply of credit from financial\ninstitutions.\n5\n\nOnce this massive credit crunch hit, it didn’t take long before we were in a recession.\nThe recession, in turn, deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell, and credit\nlosses of financial institutions surged. Indeed, we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse\nfeedback loop for more than a year. A process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to\nnearly every corner of the economy. Consumers are pulling back on purchases, especially on\ndurable goods, to build their savings. Businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying\noff workers to preserve cash. And, financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital\nand improve their chances of weathering the current storm. Once again, Minsky understood this\ndynamic. He spoke of the paradox of deleveraging, in which precautions that may be smart for\nindividuals and firms—and indeed essential to return the economy to a normal state—\nnevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole.\nThe U.S. economy just entered the sixth quarter of recession. Economic activity and\nemployment are contracting sharply, with weakness evident in every major sector aside from the\nfederal government. Financial markets and institutions remain highly stressed, notwithstanding a\nfew welcome signs of stability due mainly to Federal Reserve and federal government credit\npolicies. The negative dynamics between the real and financial sides of the economy have\ncreated severe downside risks. While we’ve seen some tentative signs of improvement in the\neconomic data very recently, it’s still impossible to know how deep the contraction will\nultimately be.\nAs I mentioned earlier, the Minsky meltdown is global in nature, reflecting the ever-\nincreasing interconnectedness of financial markets and institutions around the world. The\nrecession is the first during the postwar period to see simultaneous contractions in output in\nEurope, Japan, and North America. Economic growth in these areas has weakened sharply as the\n6\n\nfinancial pain has spread and the U.S. recession has spilled over to our trading partners.\nForecasts for growth in Europe and Japan in 2009 are now even weaker than for the United\nStates. What’s more, many developing nations face stark challenges as markets for their\nproducts have dried up and capital inflows have abruptly halted, making debt refinancing—if\nnecessary—difficult, if not impossible. The global nature of the downturn raises the odds that\nthe recession will be prolonged, since neither we nor our trade partners can look to a boost from\nforeign demand.\nBubbles and monetary policy\nThe severity of these financial and economic problems creates a very strong case for\ngovernment and central bank action. I’m encouraged that we are seeing an almost\nunprecedented outpouring of innovative fiscal and monetary policies aimed at resolving the\ncrisis. Of course, fiscal stimulus played a central role in Minsky’s policy prescriptions for\ncombating economic cycles. Minsky also emphasized the importance of lender-of-last-resort\ninterventions by the Federal Reserve, and this is a tool we have relied on heavily. I believe that\nMinsky would also approve of the Fed’s current “credit easing” policies. Since the\nintensification of the financial crisis last fall, the Fed has expanded its balance sheet from around\n$850 billion to just over $2 trillion and has announced programs that are likely to take it yet\nhigher. In effect, the government is easing the financial fallout resulting from virulent\ndeleveraging throughout the private sector by increasing its own leverage in a partial and\ntemporary offset.8\n8 Paul McCulley has emphasized the importance of such a government role to address what he refers to as the\n“reverse Minsky journey.” See “Saving Capitalistic Banking from Itself,” Global Central Bank Focus, PIMCO,\nFebruary 2009.\n7\n\nHowever, as I said at the beginning of my talk, this evening I want to address another\nquestion that has been the subject of much debate for many years: Should central banks attempt\nto deflate asset price bubbles before they get big enough to cause big problems? Until recently,\nmost central bankers would have said no. They would have argued that policy should focus\nsolely on inflation, employment, and output goals—even in the midst of an apparent asset-price\nbubble.9 That was the view that prevailed during the tech stock bubble and I myself have\nsupported this approach in the past. However, now that we face the tangible and tragic\nconsequences of the bursting of the house price bubble, I think it is time to take another look.\nLet me briefly review the arguments for and against policies aimed at counteracting\nbubbles. The conventional wisdom generally followed by the Fed and central banks in most\ninflation-targeting countries is that monetary policy should respond to an asset price only to the\nextent that it will affect the future path of output and inflation, which are the proper concerns of\nmonetary policy.10 For example, a surging stock market can be expected to lead to stronger\ndemand for goods and services by raising the wealth of households and reducing the cost of\ncapital for businesses. As a result, higher stock prices mean that the stance of monetary policy\nneeds to be tighter, but only enough to offset the macroeconomic consequences on aggregate\ndemand created by a larger stock of wealth. In other words, policy would not respond to the\nstock market boom itself, but only to the consequences of the boom on the macroeconomy.\n(http://www.pimco.com/LeftNav/Featured+Market+Commentary/FF/2009/GCB+February+2009+McCulley+Savin\ng+Capitalistic+Banking.htm)\n9 Donald L. Kohn, “Monetary Policy and Asset Prices Revisited,” speech at the Cato Institute’s 26th Annual\nMonetary Policy Conference, Washington, D.C., November 19, 2008\n(http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kohn20081119a.htm); Frederick S. Mishkin, “How Should We\nRespond to Asset Price Bubbles,” speech at the Wharton Financial Institutions Center and Oliver Wyman Institute’s\nAnnual Financial Risk Roundtable, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, May 15, 2008.\n(http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/mishkin20080515a.htm)\n10 Glenn D. Rudebusch, “Monetary Policy and Asset Price Bubbles,” FRBSF Economic Letter 2005-18, August 5,\n2005. (http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2005/el2005-18.html)\n8\n\nHowever, other observers argue that monetary authorities must consider responding\ndirectly to an asset price bubble when one is detected. This is because—as we are witnessing—\nbursting bubbles can seriously harm economic performance, and monetary policy is hard-pressed\nto respond effectively after the fact. Therefore, central banks may prefer to try to eliminate, or at\nleast reduce the size of, this threat directly. Under this approach, policymakers would push\ninterest rates higher than would be indicated under conventional policy. The result, of course,\nwould be that output and employment would be reduced in the near-term, which is the price of\nmitigating the risk of serious financial and economic turmoil later on.\nWhat are the issues that separate the anti-bubble monetary policy activists from the\nskeptics? First, some of those who oppose such policy question whether bubbles even exist.\nThey maintain that asset prices reflect the collective information and wisdom of traders in\norganized markets. Trying to deflate an apparent bubble would go against precisely those\n“experts” who best understand the fundamental factors underlying asset prices. It seems to me\nthough that this argument is particularly difficult to defend in light of the poor decisions and\nwidespread dysfunction we have seen in many markets during the current turmoil.\nSecond, even if bubbles do occur, it’s an open question whether policymakers can\nidentify them in time to act effectively. Bubbles are not easy to detect because estimates of the\nunderlying fundamentals are imprecise. For example, in the case of house prices, it is common\nto estimate fundamental values by looking at the ratio of house prices to rents, which can be\nthought of as equivalent to a dividend-price ratio for the stock market.11 If this ratio rises\nsignificantly above its fundamental, or long-run, value, the possibility of a bubble should be\nconsidered. Indeed, from 2002 to early 2006, this ratio zoomed to about 90 percent above its\n11 Joshua Gallin, “The Long-Run Relationship between House Prices and Rents,” Finance and Economics\nDiscussion Series 2004-50, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. (forthcoming in\nReal Estate Economics). (http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2004/200450/200450abs.html)\n9\n\nlong-run value, far outstripping any previous level. Nonetheless, even when house prices were\nsoaring, some experts doubted that a bubble existed. That said, by 2005 I think most people\nunderstood that—at a minimum—there was a substantial risk that houses had become\novervalued. Even at that point though, many thought the correction in house prices would be\nslow, not the rapid adjustment that did occur.12\nNow, even if we accept that we can identify bubbles as they happen, another question\narises: Is the threat so serious that a monetary response is imperative? It would make sense for\nmonetary policy makers to intervene only if the fallout were likely to be quite severe and\ndifficult to deal with after the fact. We know that the effects of booms and busts in asset prices\nsometimes show themselves with significant lags. In those cases, conventional policy\napproaches can be effective. For example, fluctuations in equity prices generally affect wealth\nand consumer demand quite gradually. A central bank may prefer to adjust short-term interest\nrates after the bubble bursts to counter the depressing effects on demand. The tech stock bubble\nseems to fit this mold. The price-dividend ratio for these stocks reached dizzying heights and\nmany observers were convinced that a crash was inevitable. But monetary policy makers did not\ntry to stop the relentless climb of tech stock prices, although they raised interest rates toward the\nend of the period to dampen emerging inflationary pressures. Instead, it was only after tech\nstocks collapsed that policy eased to offset the negative wealth effect and, as unemployment\nrose, to help return the economy to full employment. The recession at the beginning of the\ndecade was fairly mild and did not involve pervasive financial market disruptions.\n12 Kristopher Gerardi, Andreas Lehnert, Shane M. Sherlund, and Paul Willen, “Making Sense of the Subprime\nCrisis,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Fall 2008, pp. 69–160.\n(http://www.brookings.edu/economics/bpea/~/media/Files/Programs/ES/BPEA/2008_fall_bpea_papers/2008_fall_b\npea_gerardi_sherlund_lehnert_willen.pdf)\n10\n\nStill, just like infections, some bursting asset price bubbles are more virulent than others.\nThe current recession is a case in point. As house prices have plunged, the turmoil has been\ntransmitted to the economy much more quickly and violently than interest rate policy has been\nable to offset.\nYou’ll recognize right away that the assets at risk in the tech stock bubble were equities,\nwhile the volatile assets in the current crisis involve debt instruments held widely by global\nfinancial institutions. It may be that credit booms, such as the one that spurred house price and\nbond price increases, hold more dangerous systemic risks than other asset bubbles. By their\nnature, credit booms are especially prone to generating powerful adverse feedback loops between\nfinancial markets and real economic activity. It follows then, that if all asset bubbles are not\ncreated equal, policymakers could decide to intervene only in those cases that seem especially\ndangerous.\nThat brings up a fourth point: even if a dangerous asset price bubble is detected and\naction to rein it in is warranted, conventional monetary policy may not be the best approach. It’s\ntrue that moderate increases in the policy interest rate might constrain the bubble and reduce the\nrisk of severe macroeconomic dislocation. In the current episode, higher short-term interest rates\nprobably would have restrained the demand for housing by raising mortgage interest rates, and\nthis might have slowed the pace of house price increases. In addition, as Hyun Song Shin and\nhis coauthors have noted in important work related to Minsky’s, tighter monetary policy may be\nassociated with reduced leverage and slower credit growth, especially in securitized markets.13\nThus, monetary policy that leans against bubble expansion may also enhance financial stability\nby slowing credit booms and lowering overall leverage.\n13 Tobias Adrian and Hyun Song Shin, “Money, Liquidity, and Monetary Policy,” American Economic Review\nPapers and Proceedings, forthcoming.\n11\n\nNonetheless, these linkages remain controversial and bubbles may not be predictably\nsusceptible to interest rate policy actions. And there’s a question of collateral damage. Even if\nhigher interest rates take some air out of a bubble, such a strategy may have an unacceptably\ndepressing effect on the economy as a whole. There is also the harm that can result from “type 2\nerrors,” when policymakers respond to asset price developments that, with the benefit of\nhindsight, turn out not to have been bubbles at all. For both of these reasons, central bankers\nmay be better off avoiding monetary strategies and instead relying on more targeted and lower-\ncost alternative approaches to manage bubbles, such as financial regulatory and supervisory\ntools. I will turn to that topic in just a minute.\nIn summary, when it comes to using monetary policy to deflate asset bubbles, we must\nacknowledge the difficulty of identifying bubbles, and uncertainties in the relationship between\nmonetary policy and financial stability. At the same time though, policymakers often must act\non the basis of incomplete knowledge. What has become patently obvious is that not dealing\nwith certain kinds of bubbles before they get big can have grave consequences. This lends more\nweight to arguments in favor of attempting to mitigate bubbles, especially when a credit boom is\nthe driving factor. I would not advocate making it a regular practice to use monetary policy to\nlean against asset price bubbles. However recent experience has made me more open to action.\nI can now imagine circumstances that would justify leaning against a bubble with tighter\nmonetary policy. Clearly further research may help clarify these issues.14\n14 The following conference volumes provide an introduction and references to the research literature now available:\nAsset Price Bubbles: The Implications for Monetary, Regulatory, and International Policies, ed. William Hunter,\nGeorge Kaufman, and Michael Pomerleano (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2003); Asset Prices and Monetary Policy,\ned. Anthony Richards and Tim Robinson (Reserve Bank of Australia, 2003).\n(http://www.rba.gov.au/PublicationsAndResearch/Conferences/2003/index.html)\n12\n\nAnother important tool for financial stability\nRegardless of one’s views on using monetary policy to reduce bubbles, it seems plain that\nsupervisory and regulatory policies could help prevent the kinds of problems we now face.\nIndeed, this was one of Minsky’s major prescriptions for mitigating financial instability. I am\nheartened that there is now widespread agreement among policymakers and in Congress on the\nneed to overhaul our supervisory and regulatory system, and broad agreement on the basic\nelements of reform.15\nMany of the proposals under discussion are intended to strengthen micro-prudential\nsupervision. Micro-prudential supervision aims to insure that individual financial institutions,\nincluding any firm with access to the safety net, but particularly those that are systemically\nimportant, are well managed and avoid excessive risk. The current system of supervision is\ncharacterized by uneven and fragmented supervision, and it’s riddled with gaps that enhance the\nopportunity for regulatory arbitrage. Such arbitrage was a central component in the excessive\nrisk-taking that led to our current problems. It is now widely agreed that such gaps and overlaps\nmust be eliminated, and systemically important institutions—whether banks, insurance firms,\ninvestment firms, or hedge funds—should be subject to consolidated supervision by a single\nagency. Systemic institutions would be defined by key characteristics, such as size, leverage,\nreliance on short-term funding, importance as sources of credit or liquidity, and\n15 See, for example, Timothy Geithner, Testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, March 26, 2009\n(http://www.ustreas.gov/press/releases/tg67.htm); Ben S.

Another\ncritical shortcoming of the current system is that it lacks any legal process to enable supervisors\nof financial conglomerates and nonbanks to wind down the activities of failed firms in an orderly\nfashion. The need for a resolution framework that would permit such wind-downs of\nsystemically important firms is also widely accepted.\nThe current crisis has afforded plentiful opportunities for supervisors to reflect on the\neffectiveness of our current system of micro-prudential supervision. The “lessons learned” will\nundoubtedly enhance its conduct going forward.16 But, regardless of how well micro-prudential\nsupervision is executed, on its own it will never be adequate to safeguard the economy from the\ndestructive boom and bust cycles that Minsky considered endemic in capitalistic systems.\nAnalogous to Keynes’ paradox of thrift, the assumption that safe institutions automatically result\nin a safe system reflects a fallacy of composition. Thus, macro-prudential supervision—to\nprotect the system as a whole—is needed to mitigate financial crises.\nThe roles of micro- and macro-prudential supervision are fundamentally different. In\nprinciple, many individual institutions could be managing risk reasonably well, while the system\nas a whole remained vulnerable due to interconnections among financial institutions that could\nlead to contagious cycles of loss and illiquidity. For example, it is prudent for institutions to sell\nrisky assets and pay off debt when a decline in asset prices depletes capital. But the\nsimultaneous behavior of many institutions to protect themselves in this way only intensifies the\ndecline in prices. Moreover, when many institutions try to de-lever simultaneously, market\n16 See President’s Working Group on Financial Markets, “Policy Statement on Financial Market Developments,”\nMarch 13. 2008 (http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/reports/pwgpolicystatemktturmoil_03122008.pdf); Financial\nStability Forum, “Report of the Financial Stability Forum on Enhancing Market and Institutional Resilience,” April\n7, 2008 (http://www.fsforum.org/publications/r_0804.pdf); Senior Supervisors Group, “Observations on Risk\nManagement Practices during the Recent Market Turbulence,” March 6, 2008.\n(http://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/banking/2008/SSG_Risk_Mgt_doc_final.pdf)\n14\n\nliquidity can instantly evaporate. Systemic risk is endogenous to the working of the financial\nsystem.\nCapital requirements could serve as a key tool of macro-prudential supervision. Most\nproposals for regulatory reform would impose higher capital requirements on systemically\nimportant institutions and also design them to vary in a procyclical manner. In other words,\ncapital requirements would rise in economic upswings, so that institutions would build strength\nin good times, and they would fall in recessions. This pattern would counteract the natural\ntendency of leverage to amplify business cycle swings—serving as a kind of “automatic\nstabilizer” for the financial system. Financial stability might also be enhanced by reforming the\naccounting rules governing loan loss reserves. A more forward-looking system for reserving\nagainst such losses could make regulatory capital less sensitive to economic fluctuations.17 In\naddition, most proposals for financial reform emphasize the need for stronger liquidity standards.\nThe funding of long-term assets with short-term, often overnight liabilities, is a source of\nsystemic vulnerability. One interesting recent proposal would disincent overreliance on short-\nterm funding by relating an institution’s capital charges to the degree of maturity mismatch\nbetween its assets and liabilities.18 There has been considerable discussion recently of the need\nfor a new macro-prudential or “financial stability” supervisor—whether the Fed or some other\nagency—with responsibility to monitor, assess, and mitigate systemic risks in the financial\nsystem as a whole.\nAt this stage, the proposed reforms involve broad principles. The translation of those\nprinciples into a detailed supervisory program will be challenging, to say the least. But I am\n17 See Eric S.

    "text": "Keynote speech to FRBSF Conference: Recovery, Renewal, Rebuilding – a Federal Reserve\nConference Series\nLos Angeles, CA\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery Tuesday, July 15, 2008, 12:30 PM Pacific, 3:30 PM Eastern\nStabilizing Communities-Addressing the Negative Impacts of Foreclosure\nGood afternoon everyone. It is a pleasure to be here today. On behalf of my colleagues at the\nSan Francisco Fed, I would like to thank you for taking the time to participate in this symposium,\nand more specifically, to engage in a discussion of what strategies are needed to stabilize\ncommunities in the wake of foreclosures. This discussion is critical: not only to minimize the\nnegative impacts of foreclosure on borrowers and neighborhoods, but also to help promote local\nand regional economic recovery and growth.\nThe rapid rise in mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures has had significant negative ripple\neffects, and not just at the neighborhood level. My colleagues and I have been assessing the\nimpact of these trends on the financial markets and the U.S. economy. Last week, in both San\nDiego and Portland, I shared my views on how the current credit crunch, the downturn in the\nhousing market, and rising commodity prices are affecting the economic outlook. From my\nperspective as a monetary policymaker, these developments pose serious challenges and will\nrequire vigilance both in monitoring events going forward and in acting as needed to achieve our\ndual mandate of low and stable inflation and maximum sustainable employment and economic\ngrowth.\nIn my remarks today, I will take a broader perspective, reflecting not only some of the other\nresponsibilities of a Reserve Bank president, but also a more personal perspective. I have been,\nand remain, deeply concerned about the impact that foreclosures are having on families and\nneighborhoods, and the long-term implications of foreclosure for low-income communities,\nparticularly within the Federal Reserve’s 12th District.\n1\n\nThey say “a picture is worth a thousand words,” so let me begin with a few slides that illustrate\nthe scale of foreclosures in our District. While some communities have been struggling with\nhigh rates of foreclosure for some time,1 the recent rise in delinquencies and foreclosures in\nArizona, California, and Nevada has been sudden and substantial. Data from the Mortgage\nBankers Association show that at the start of 2006, these states had among the lowest foreclosure\nrates in the country; by the first quarter of this year, they were among the top five states in the\nnation in overall foreclosure rates\nMoreover, as the following national maps show, the number of communities affected by\nforeclosures has grown dramatically in a very short time. In September of 2007, data at the zip\ncode level on the percent of loans in foreclosure, as well as properties held by lenders or\nservicers as \"real estate owned,\" or \"REOs,\" showed high foreclosure rates in some areas,\nparticularly in Midwestern states, but also in some distinct hotspots in California’s Central\nValley, Florida, and Colorado. Data from April of this year, however, show that the crisis has\nintensified significantly. This map paints a daunting picture for many regions of the country, but\nit is hard to ignore the wave of foreclosures and REOs in California’s Central Valley and Inland\nEmpire, as well as in the cities of Las Vegas and Phoenix. At a more localized level, cities such\nas Los Angeles are also struggling with areas of concentrated foreclosures and REOs, while\nother neighborhoods seem less affected by the crisis.\nThe impacts of these foreclosures are devastating on a number of levels. For borrowers,\nforeclosures can exact significant costs and hardships, involving not only the loss of home equity\nand impaired credit, but also potentially limiting access to stable, decent housing and disrupting\nlabor market participation.\nIn addition, as foreclosures have become increasingly concentrated in certain neighborhoods,\nthey threaten to have significant negative spillover effects on the wider community. Research\nindicates that foreclosures tend to reduce the value of nearby properties significantly, especially\nwhen vacancies drag out and the local housing market is weak. In such neighborhoods, “For\nSale” signs become bad omens of a self-reinforcing cycle of decline—more homes for sale put\ndownward pressure on the local housing market that in turn can lead to yet more defaults and\n2\n\nforeclosures. While more research is needed to get a better handle on the size of these impacts,\nthere is no doubt that the mortgage crisis is contributing to a loss of equity for a large number of\nhomeowners in low-income communities, and that it threatens to undermine ongoing\nneighborhood revitalization efforts.\nWe are also beginning to see direct impacts from foreclosures and the concurrent decline in\nhouse values on municipal budgets. For example, there’s the loss of tax revenue associated with\nvacant properties, and there are rising costs associated with foreclosure-related services, such as\nincreased policing to deter crime around abandoned properties. As declining property taxes and\ntransfer fees shrink local government revenues, vital services to low- and moderate-income\nfamilies may also suffer.\nWhat this means is that the foreclosure crisis is likely to have profound impacts on low-income\ncommunities, with effects that go well beyond the housing sector. And countering them will\nrequire more robust and direct responses—at both the local and federal level.\nBefore turning to the issue of how to respond to rising neighborhood foreclosures, I would like to\nemphasize that the Federal Reserve views the high rate of mortgage foreclosures as an urgent\nproblem and preventing unnecessary foreclosures should be a key priority for both the private\nand public sectors. Our goal should be to keep existing owners in their homes wherever possible\nas a way of avoiding the significant costs of foreclosure. Over the past year, much emphasis has\nbeen placed on improving borrower outreach through public service announcements and\ncommunity events, developing systematic and streamlined approaches to restructuring adjustable\nrate loans, and creating new refinance options to help borrowers shift into more sustainable loan\nproducts. These efforts are having some success. To use California as an example, according to\ndata reported by the HOPE NOW Alliance, in the 1st quarter of 2008, approximately 11,500\nborrowers received a modification to their loan terms, while another 20,500 entered into formal\nrepayment plans.2 While these efforts are important and reflect significant progress, I would\nnote that in the state we had about same number of foreclosure sales, 32,000 in the 1st quarter,\naccording data from HOPE NOW. Also, the scale of the loan modifications and repayment plans\nto date are small compared to the volume of loans that are 60 or more days delinquent—an\n3\n\nestimated 186,000 loans in California alone. It is critical that we continue to explore a broader\nrange of interventions that would help keep families in their homes, including efforts to give\nservicers more flexibility in the loan modification process.\nAt the same time, we need to maintain a perspective on what can be achieved in terms of\nforeclosure prevention, and many communities are already grappling with large numbers of\nforeclosures. The reasons for this jump in foreclosures are complex and intertwined, yet research\nat the San Francisco Fed finds that house price declines have been the most important\ndeterminant of mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures.3 Areas of Arizona, California, and\nNevada have all seen dramatic adjustments in house prices. By one index (Standard & Poor's\nCase Shiller House Price Index), house prices here in Los Angeles are down over 25 percent\nfrom the peak in late 2006 (September). While there likely has been some feedback from\nforeclosures to house prices in various markets, most of the decline in house values to date\nreflects a realignment of prices that had risen sharply relative to fundamentals during the earlier\nhousing boom. The potential for further realignment and, thus, lower house prices will make it\nthat much more difficult to limit foreclosures.\nThat is why this symposium on responding to the foreclosures that have already occurred and\nwill occur is so important. The central question driving this symposium is: how can we best\nminimize the negative impacts of these foreclosures on cities, neighborhoods, and families?\nThere are no easy answers to this question, and our hope is that this symposium will give you the\nopportunity to discuss emerging strategies and develop solutions that can help to overcome the\nchallenges that nonprofits, municipalities, and lenders face in responding to this still unfolding,\nmulti-faceted crisis. Let me just raise a few of the issues that the symposium will help to\naddress.\nThe first issue—and perhaps the most formidable—is identifying sources of funding to allow\neither nonprofits or local governments to acquire and rehab foreclosed properties where needed.\nSeveral of the workshop panelists will be describing their efforts to leverage investment and\nsubsidies—both public and private—for the redevelopment of foreclosed properties. Some are\n4\n\ndiverting existing funds for housing to respond to rising foreclosures, while others are tapping\ninto financing tools such as equity equivalent, or EQ2 investments, New Markets Tax Credits,\nand loan pools to generate much needed capital. In addition, many of you have been involved in\ndeveloping federal and state legislation that would direct funding to help communities reduce\ndownward pressure on local housing markets. Given the significant negative spillover effects of\nforeclosures, I believe that there is a strong case for directing public funding to the acquisition\nand rehab of REO properties.Yet questions remain regarding the targeting of these types of\nfunds, and determining how they can best be directed to neighborhoods most in need of public\nsubsidy. One particularly important question is how to respond to foreclosures that are occurring\nin suburban neighborhoods in areas like the Central Valley, which saw rapid construction and\ngrowth during the housing boom. How will interventions in these areas need to differ from those\nin older, low-income neighborhoods within the urban core?\nThe second objective of this symposium is to help foster the partnerships that will be needed to\nimplement comprehensive acquisition and redevelopment strategies. The complexity and scale\nof the foreclosure issue calls for broad cross-sectoral partnerships among nonprofits, community\ndevelopment financial institutions, lenders, real estate professionals, and government agencies,\nboth locally and nationally. In addition, local organizations and government agencies will need\nto develop new capacities to manage and redevelop large numbers of foreclosed properties.\nChanges in institutional structures within financial institutions will be necessary as well,\nespecially to promote flexibility in working with nonprofits and the public sector on this issue.\nThe current nature of pooling and servicing agreements—which often include a variety of levels\nof authorization and interests—can not only thwart loan modification efforts, but also limit the\nability of servicers to negotiate with governmental agencies and nonprofits for discounted sales\nof REO properties.\nThird, the symposium sets out the ambitious goal of thinking about how the current crisis can be\nused as an opportunity to expand the supply of affordable housing. Despite recent price declines,\nhousing affordability remains a critical issue in many parts of the12th District.4 During this\nsymposium, we’ll ask you to be creative in wrestling with a number of issues related to\nexpanding affordability. How can we convert foreclosed properties into affordable rental or\nhomeownership opportunities? Is it possible to develop strategies that can keep delinquent\n5\n\nborrowers in their homes—perhaps under lease-to-purchase agreements— thereby avoiding\nforeclosure and contributing to family and neighborhood stability at the same time? The current\nenvironment of tighter credit and underwriting standards means that we also need to develop new\nproducts and programs that can help low-income families access responsible loans going\nforward. We should not view the current crisis as justification to abandon the goal of expanding\naccess to credit among low-income households, since access to credit, and the subsequent ability\nto buy a home, remains one of the most important mechanisms we have to help low-income\nfamilies build wealth over the long term.5\nConclusion\nLet me close by emphasizing the Federal Reserve’s commitment to addressing the mortgage and\nforeclosure crisis on multiple fronts as part of our Homeownership and Mortgage Initiatives. On\nMonday, the Federal Reserve Board issued its new Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act,\nor HOEPA regulations, which are designed to strengthen protections for borrowers and to\nprohibit unfair and deceptive practices in the mortgage market. Importantly, the new regulations\nestablish a new category of “higher-priced mortgages, and prohibit a lender from making a loan\nwithout regard to borrowers’ ability to repay the loan from income and assets other than the\nhome’s value. Moreover, to show that a lender violated this prohibition, a borrower does not\nneed to demonstrate that it is part of a “pattern or practice.” In addition, the rules place tighter\nrestrictions on prepayment penalties.6\nThe Federal Reserve is also leveraging its strengths in data analysis and research, and many of\nthe Reserve Banks are publishing new papers that can help us to understand the multi-faceted\nnature of the current mortgage crisis. Finally, in addition to our regional outreach events that\naim to educate stakeholders about foreclosure trends and support local foreclosure prevention\nefforts, we have also launched a System-wide partnership with NeighborWorks America to share\nbest practices from across the country for mitigating the impact of foreclosures on communities.\nThis symposium is one part of the Fed’s efforts in this area, and is part of a Federal Reserve\nSystem conference series, Recovery, Renewal, Rebuilding, that seeks to develop and disseminate\ninnovative strategies and policies that can help to address the broad range of challenges related to\n6\n\nthe rise in mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures. At the San Francisco Fed, we decided that,\ngiven the scale of foreclosures in communities in Arizona, California, and Nevada, it would be\nmost important to focus the discussion primarily on the issue of redeveloping foreclosed\nproperties into affordable housing. Over the next day and a half, practitioners from across the\ncountry have agreed to share the models that they are developing; some are already well on their\nway to acquiring and redeveloping REO properties, while others are still figuring out how to\nraise capital or structure holding companies. The goal of this symposium is to provide all of you\nwith the chance to share your ideas, your successes and your failures, and to learn from your\ncolleagues in other cities. We hope that you find that these discussions are productive, and we\nlook forward to disseminating the best practices that emerge from this symposium through our\nwebsite and publications, so that others grappling with foreclosures in their communities can\nbenefit as well. Thank you for your time, and I hope you enjoy the rest of the conference.\n1 For example, cities such as Chicago and Minneapolis were experiencing high levels of foreclosure well before the\ncurrent national increase in foreclosure rates.\n2 HOPE NOW Alliance (2008), April State Data Tables, accessed online on July 8, 2008 at\nhttp://www.hopenow.com/upload/data/files/April%20State%20Date%20Tables.pdf.\n3\nSee, Doms, Mark, Frederick Furlong, and John Krainer. 2007. “Subprime Mortgage Delinquency Rates.” Federal\nReserve Bank of San Francisco Working Paper 2007-33., and “House Prices and Subprime Mortgage\nDelinquencies.” FRBSF Economic Letter 2007-14 (June 8); and FRBSF 2007 Annual Report (2008).\n4 The State of the Nation’s Housing 2007 (Joint Center for Housing Studies, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA,\n2007).\n5 This assumes responsible lending and that homeownership is sustainable.

    "text": "Presentation to the 18th Annual Hyman P. Minsky Conference on the State of the U.S. and\nWorld Economies—“Meeting the Challenges of the Financial Crisis”\nOrganized by the Levy Economics Institute of Bard College\nNew York City\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on April 16, 2009, 8:00 PM Eastern Time, 5:00 PM Pacific\nA Minsky Meltdown:\nLessons for Central Bankers1\nIt’s a great pleasure to speak to this distinguished group at a conference named for\nHyman P. Minsky. My last talk here took place 13 years ago when I served on the Fed’s Board\nof Governors. My topic then was “The ‘New’ Science of Credit Risk Management at Financial\nInstitutions.” It described innovations that I expected to improve the measurement and\nmanagement of risk. My talk today is titled “A Minsky Meltdown: Lessons for Central\nBankers.” I won’t dwell on the irony of that. Suffice it to say that, with the financial world in\nturmoil, Minsky’s work has become required reading. It is getting the recognition it richly\ndeserves. The dramatic events of the past year and a half are a classic case of the kind of\nsystemic breakdown that he—and relatively few others—envisioned.\nCentral to Minsky’s view of how financial meltdowns occur, of course, are “asset price\nbubbles.” This evening I will revisit the ongoing debate over whether central banks should act to\ncounter such bubbles and discuss “lessons learned.” This issue seems especially compelling now\nthat it’s evident that episodes of exuberance, like the ones that led to our bond and house price\nbubbles, can be time bombs that cause catastrophic damage to the economy when they explode.\nIndeed, in view of the financial mess we’re living through, I found it fascinating to read Minsky\n1 I would like to thank John Judd and Sam Zuckerman for exceptional assistance in preparing these remarks.\n1\n\nagain and reexamine my own views about central bank responses to speculative financial booms.\nMy thoughts on this have changed somewhat, as I will explain.2\nAs always, my comments are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my\ncolleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nMinsky and the current crisis\nOne of the critical features of Minsky’s world view is that borrowers, lenders, and\nregulators are lulled into complacency as asset prices rise.3 It was not so long ago—though it\nseems like a lifetime—that many of us were trying to figure out why investors were demanding\nso little compensation for risk. For example, long-term interest rates were well below what\nappeared consistent with the expected future path of short-term rates. This phenomenon, which\nended abruptly in mid-2007, was famously characterized by then-Chairman Greenspan as a\n“conundrum.”4 Credit spreads too were razor thin. But for Minsky, this behavior of interest\nrates and loan pricing might not have been so puzzling. He might have pointed out that such a\nsense of safety on the part of investors is characteristic of financial booms. The incaution that\nreigned by the middle of this decade had been fed by roughly twenty years of the so-called “great\nmoderation,” when most industrialized economies experienced steady growth and low and stable\ninflation. Moreover, the world economy had shaken off the effects of the bursting of an earlier\nasset price bubble—the technology stock boom—with comparatively little damage.\n2 I want to give credit to PIMCO’s always-astute Paul McCulley—who gave last year’s keynote address—for\nleading the Minsky revival and pointing out the relevance of Minsky’s work to our current financial troubles.\n3 For example, see Hyman P. Minsky, “The Financial Instability Hypothesis,” The Jerome Levy Economics Institute\nof Bard College, Working Paper No. 74, May 1992 (http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=161024);\nand Robert Pollin, “The Relevance of Hyman Minsky,” Challenge, March/April 1997.\n4 Alan Greenspan, “Federal Reserve Board’s semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress,” testimony\nbefore the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, February 16, 2005.\n(http://www.federalreserve.gov/Boarddocs/hh/2005/february/testimony.htm)\n2\n\nChairman Bernanke has argued that other factors besides complacency were responsible\nfor low interest rates in this period.5 A glut of foreign saving mainly generated in developing\ncountries such as China and India fueled demand for dollar-denominated assets. This ample\nsupply of foreign savings combined with a low U.S. personal saving rate, large U.S. government\ndeficits, and high productivity gains to produce a huge current account deficit. As a result, vast\nquantities of funds began “sloshing around” in our economy seeking investment projects.\nFed monetary policy may also have contributed to the U.S. credit boom and the\nassociated house price bubble by maintaining a highly accommodative stance from 2002 to\n2004.6 This accommodative stance was motivated by what Greenspan called “risk management\npolicy,” in which, to reduce the possibility of deflation, the funds rate was held below the level\nthat would otherwise have been chosen to promote a return to full employment.7 In effect, the\nFed took a calculated risk. It took out some insurance to lower the chances of a potentially\ndevastating deflationary episode. The cost of that insurance was an increased possibility of\noverheating the economy. These policy actions arguably played some role in our house price\nbubble. But they clearly were not the only factor, since such bubbles appeared in many countries\nthat did not have highly accommodative monetary policies.\nAs Minsky’s financial instability hypothesis suggests, when optimism is high and ample\nfunds are available for investment, investors tend to migrate from the safe hedge end of the\nMinsky spectrum to the risky speculative and Ponzi end. Indeed, in the current episode,\n5 Ben S. Bernanke, “The Global Saving Glut and the U.S. Current Account Deficit,” remarks at the Sandridge\nLecture, Virginia Association of Economics, Richmond, Virginia, March 10, 2005.\n(http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/200503102/)\n6 John B. Taylor, “The Financial Crisis and the Policy Responses: An Empirical Analysis of What Went Wrong,”\nNBER Working Paper No. 14631, January 2009. (http://www.nber.org/papers/w14631)\n7 Alan Greenspan, “Monetary Policy under Uncertainty,” remarks at a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve\nBank of Kansas City, Jackson Hole, Wyoming, August 29, 2003.\n(http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2003/20030829/default.htm)\n3\n\ninvestors tried to raise returns by increasing leverage and sacrificing liquidity through short-\nterm—sometimes overnight—debt financing. Simultaneously, new and fancy methods of\nfinancial engineering allowed widespread and complex securitization of many types of assets,\nmost famously in subprime lending. In addition, exotic derivatives, such as credit default swaps,\nwere thought to dilute risk by spreading it widely. These new financial products provided the\nbasis for an illusion of low risk, a misconception that was amplified by the inaccurate analyses of\nthe rating agencies. This created a new wrinkle that even Minsky may not have imagined. Some\nof the investors who put money into highly risky assets were blithely unaware of how far out on\na limb they had gone. Many of those who thought they were in the hedge category were shocked\nto discover that, in fact, they were speculative or Ponzi units.\nAt the same time, securitization added distance between borrowers and lenders. As a\nresult, underwriting standards were significantly relaxed. Much of this financing was done in\nthe “shadow banking system,” consisting of entities that acted a lot like banks—albeit very\nhighly leveraged and illiquid banks—but were outside the bank regulatory net. Although these\ndevelopments reached an extreme state in the U.S. subprime mortgage market, risky practices\nwere employed broadly in the U.S. financial system. And this activity extended far beyond our\nborders as players throughout the global financial system eagerly participated. As banks and\ntheir large, nonbank competitors became involved in ever more complicated securitizations, they\nbegan to employ sophisticated “new tools” to measure and manage the credit risks flowing from\nthese transactions. But those tools—which I described in my speech 13 years ago—proved\ninsufficient for the task.\nThis cult of risky behavior was not limited to financial institutions. U.S. households\nenthusiastically leveraged themselves to the hilt. The personal saving rate, which had been\n4\n\nfalling for over a decade, hovered only slightly above zero from mid-2005 to mid-2007. A good\ndeal of this leverage came in the form of mortgage debt. The vast use of exotic mortgages—such\nas subprime, interest-only, low-doc and no-doc, and option-ARMs—offers an example of\nMinsky’s Ponzi finance, in which a loan can only be refinanced if the price of the underlying\nasset increases. In fact, many subprime loans were explicitly designed to be good for the\nborrower only if they could be refinanced at a lower rate, a benefit limited to those who\nestablished a pattern of regular payments and built reasonable equity in their homes.\nIn retrospect, it’s not surprising that these developments led to unsustainable increases in\nbond prices and house prices. Once those prices started to go down, we were quickly in the\nmidst of a Minsky meltdown. The financial engineering that was thought to hedge risks\nprobably would have worked beautifully if individual investors had faced shocks that were\nuncorrelated with those of their counterparties. But declines in bond and house prices hit\neveryone in the same way, inflicting actual and expected credit losses broadly across the\nfinancial system. Moreover, the complexity of securitized credit instruments meant that it was\ndifficult to identify who the actual loan holders might be. Meanwhile, asset write-downs reduced\nequity cushions of financial firms and increased their leverage just when growing risks made\nthose firms seek less leverage, not more. When they tried to sell assets into illiquid markets,\nprices fell further, generating yet more selling pressure in a loss spiral that kept intensifying. We\nexperienced a “perfect storm” in financial markets: runs on highly vulnerable and systemically\nimportant financial institutions; dysfunction in most securitized credit markets; a reduction in\ninterbank lending; higher interest rates for all but the safest borrowers, matched by near-zero\nyields on Treasury bills; lower equity values; and a restricted supply of credit from financial\ninstitutions.\n5\n\nOnce this massive credit crunch hit, it didn’t take long before we were in a recession.\nThe recession, in turn, deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell, and credit\nlosses of financial institutions surged. Indeed, we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse\nfeedback loop for more than a year. A process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to\nnearly every corner of the economy. Consumers are pulling back on purchases, especially on\ndurable goods, to build their savings. Businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying\noff workers to preserve cash. And, financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital\nand improve their chances of weathering the current storm. Once again, Minsky understood this\ndynamic. He spoke of the paradox of deleveraging, in which precautions that may be smart for\nindividuals and firms—and indeed essential to return the economy to a normal state—\nnevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole.\nThe U.S. economy just entered the sixth quarter of recession. Economic activity and\nemployment are contracting sharply, with weakness evident in every major sector aside from the\nfederal government. Financial markets and institutions remain highly stressed, notwithstanding a\nfew welcome signs of stability due mainly to Federal Reserve and federal government credit\npolicies. The negative dynamics between the real and financial sides of the economy have\ncreated severe downside risks. While we’ve seen some tentative signs of improvement in the\neconomic data very recently, it’s still impossible to know how deep the contraction will\nultimately be.\nAs I mentioned earlier, the Minsky meltdown is global in nature, reflecting the ever-\nincreasing interconnectedness of financial markets and institutions around the world. The\nrecession is the first during the postwar period to see simultaneous contractions in output in\nEurope, Japan, and North America. Economic growth in these areas has weakened sharply as the\n6\n\nfinancial pain has spread and the U.S. recession has spilled over to our trading partners.\nForecasts for growth in Europe and Japan in 2009 are now even weaker than for the United\nStates. What’s more, many developing nations face stark challenges as markets for their\nproducts have dried up and capital inflows have abruptly halted, making debt refinancing—if\nnecessary—difficult, if not impossible. The global nature of the downturn raises the odds that\nthe recession will be prolonged, since neither we nor our trade partners can look to a boost from\nforeign demand.\nBubbles and monetary policy\nThe severity of these financial and economic problems creates a very strong case for\ngovernment and central bank action. I’m encouraged that we are seeing an almost\nunprecedented outpouring of innovative fiscal and monetary policies aimed at resolving the\ncrisis. Of course, fiscal stimulus played a central role in Minsky’s policy prescriptions for\ncombating economic cycles. Minsky also emphasized the importance of lender-of-last-resort\ninterventions by the Federal Reserve, and this is a tool we have relied on heavily. I believe that\nMinsky would also approve of the Fed’s current “credit easing” policies. Since the\nintensification of the financial crisis last fall, the Fed has expanded its balance sheet from around\n$850 billion to just over $2 trillion and has announced programs that are likely to take it yet\nhigher. In effect, the government is easing the financial fallout resulting from virulent\ndeleveraging throughout the private sector by increasing its own leverage in a partial and\ntemporary offset.8\n8 Paul McCulley has emphasized the importance of such a government role to address what he refers to as the\n“reverse Minsky journey.” See “Saving Capitalistic Banking from Itself,” Global Central Bank Focus, PIMCO,\nFebruary 2009.\n7\n\nHowever, as I said at the beginning of my talk, this evening I want to address another\nquestion that has been the subject of much debate for many years: Should central banks attempt\nto deflate asset price bubbles before they get big enough to cause big problems? Until recently,\nmost central bankers would have said no. They would have argued that policy should focus\nsolely on inflation, employment, and output goals—even in the midst of an apparent asset-price\nbubble.9 That was the view that prevailed during the tech stock bubble and I myself have\nsupported this approach in the past. However, now that we face the tangible and tragic\nconsequences of the bursting of the house price bubble, I think it is time to take another look.\nLet me briefly review the arguments for and against policies aimed at counteracting\nbubbles. The conventional wisdom generally followed by the Fed and central banks in most\ninflation-targeting countries is that monetary policy should respond to an asset price only to the\nextent that it will affect the future path of output and inflation, which are the proper concerns of\nmonetary policy.10 For example, a surging stock market can be expected to lead to stronger\ndemand for goods and services by raising the wealth of households and reducing the cost of\ncapital for businesses. As a result, higher stock prices mean that the stance of monetary policy\nneeds to be tighter, but only enough to offset the macroeconomic consequences on aggregate\ndemand created by a larger stock of wealth. In other words, policy would not respond to the\nstock market boom itself, but only to the consequences of the boom on the macroeconomy.\n(http://www.pimco.com/LeftNav/Featured+Market+Commentary/FF/2009/GCB+February+2009+McCulley+Savin\ng+Capitalistic+Banking.htm)\n9 Donald L. Kohn, “Monetary Policy and Asset Prices Revisited,” speech at the Cato Institute’s 26th Annual\nMonetary Policy Conference, Washington, D.C., November 19, 2008\n(http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kohn20081119a.htm); Frederick S. Mishkin, “How Should We\nRespond to Asset Price Bubbles,” speech at the Wharton Financial Institutions Center and Oliver Wyman Institute’s\nAnnual Financial Risk Roundtable, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, May 15, 2008.\n(http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/mishkin20080515a.htm)\n10 Glenn D. Rudebusch, “Monetary Policy and Asset Price Bubbles,” FRBSF Economic Letter 2005-18, August 5,\n2005. (http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2005/el2005-18.html)\n8\n\nHowever, other observers argue that monetary authorities must consider responding\ndirectly to an asset price bubble when one is detected. This is because—as we are witnessing—\nbursting bubbles can seriously harm economic performance, and monetary policy is hard-pressed\nto respond effectively after the fact. Therefore, central banks may prefer to try to eliminate, or at\nleast reduce the size of, this threat directly. Under this approach, policymakers would push\ninterest rates higher than would be indicated under conventional policy. The result, of course,\nwould be that output and employment would be reduced in the near-term, which is the price of\nmitigating the risk of serious financial and economic turmoil later on.\nWhat are the issues that separate the anti-bubble monetary policy activists from the\nskeptics? First, some of those who oppose such policy question whether bubbles even exist.\nThey maintain that asset prices reflect the collective information and wisdom of traders in\norganized markets. Trying to deflate an apparent bubble would go against precisely those\n“experts” who best understand the fundamental factors underlying asset prices. It seems to me\nthough that this argument is particularly difficult to defend in light of the poor decisions and\nwidespread dysfunction we have seen in many markets during the current turmoil.\nSecond, even if bubbles do occur, it’s an open question whether policymakers can\nidentify them in time to act effectively. Bubbles are not easy to detect because estimates of the\nunderlying fundamentals are imprecise. For example, in the case of house prices, it is common\nto estimate fundamental values by looking at the ratio of house prices to rents, which can be\nthought of as equivalent to a dividend-price ratio for the stock market.11 If this ratio rises\nsignificantly above its fundamental, or long-run, value, the possibility of a bubble should be\nconsidered. Indeed, from 2002 to early 2006, this ratio zoomed to about 90 percent above its\n11 Joshua Gallin, “The Long-Run Relationship between House Prices and Rents,” Finance and Economics\nDiscussion Series 2004-50, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. (forthcoming in\nReal Estate Economics). (http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2004/200450/200450abs.html)\n9\n\nlong-run value, far outstripping any previous level. Nonetheless, even when house prices were\nsoaring, some experts doubted that a bubble existed. That said, by 2005 I think most people\nunderstood that—at a minimum—there was a substantial risk that houses had become\novervalued. Even at that point though, many thought the correction in house prices would be\nslow, not the rapid adjustment that did occur.12\nNow, even if we accept that we can identify bubbles as they happen, another question\narises: Is the threat so serious that a monetary response is imperative? It would make sense for\nmonetary policy makers to intervene only if the fallout were likely to be quite severe and\ndifficult to deal with after the fact. We know that the effects of booms and busts in asset prices\nsometimes show themselves with significant lags. In those cases, conventional policy\napproaches can be effective. For example, fluctuations in equity prices generally affect wealth\nand consumer demand quite gradually. A central bank may prefer to adjust short-term interest\nrates after the bubble bursts to counter the depressing effects on demand. The tech stock bubble\nseems to fit this mold. The price-dividend ratio for these stocks reached dizzying heights and\nmany observers were convinced that a crash was inevitable. But monetary policy makers did not\ntry to stop the relentless climb of tech stock prices, although they raised interest rates toward the\nend of the period to dampen emerging inflationary pressures. Instead, it was only after tech\nstocks collapsed that policy eased to offset the negative wealth effect and, as unemployment\nrose, to help return the economy to full employment. The recession at the beginning of the\ndecade was fairly mild and did not involve pervasive financial market disruptions.\n12 Kristopher Gerardi, Andreas Lehnert, Shane M. Sherlund, and Paul Willen, “Making Sense of the Subprime\nCrisis,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Fall 2008, pp. 69–160.\n(http://www.brookings.edu/economics/bpea/~/media/Files/Programs/ES/BPEA/2008_fall_bpea_papers/2008_fall_b\npea_gerardi_sherlund_lehnert_willen.pdf)\n10\n\nStill, just like infections, some bursting asset price bubbles are more virulent than others.\nThe current recession is a case in point. As house prices have plunged, the turmoil has been\ntransmitted to the economy much more quickly and violently than interest rate policy has been\nable to offset.\nYou’ll recognize right away that the assets at risk in the tech stock bubble were equities,\nwhile the volatile assets in the current crisis involve debt instruments held widely by global\nfinancial institutions. It may be that credit booms, such as the one that spurred house price and\nbond price increases, hold more dangerous systemic risks than other asset bubbles. By their\nnature, credit booms are especially prone to generating powerful adverse feedback loops between\nfinancial markets and real economic activity. It follows then, that if all asset bubbles are not\ncreated equal, policymakers could decide to intervene only in those cases that seem especially\ndangerous.\nThat brings up a fourth point: even if a dangerous asset price bubble is detected and\naction to rein it in is warranted, conventional monetary policy may not be the best approach. It’s\ntrue that moderate increases in the policy interest rate might constrain the bubble and reduce the\nrisk of severe macroeconomic dislocation. In the current episode, higher short-term interest rates\nprobably would have restrained the demand for housing by raising mortgage interest rates, and\nthis might have slowed the pace of house price increases. In addition, as Hyun Song Shin and\nhis coauthors have noted in important work related to Minsky’s, tighter monetary policy may be\nassociated with reduced leverage and slower credit growth, especially in securitized markets.13\nThus, monetary policy that leans against bubble expansion may also enhance financial stability\nby slowing credit booms and lowering overall leverage.\n13 Tobias Adrian and Hyun Song Shin, “Money, Liquidity, and Monetary Policy,” American Economic Review\nPapers and Proceedings, forthcoming.\n11\n\nNonetheless, these linkages remain controversial and bubbles may not be predictably\nsusceptible to interest rate policy actions. And there’s a question of collateral damage. Even if\nhigher interest rates take some air out of a bubble, such a strategy may have an unacceptably\ndepressing effect on the economy as a whole. There is also the harm that can result from “type 2\nerrors,” when policymakers respond to asset price developments that, with the benefit of\nhindsight, turn out not to have been bubbles at all. For both of these reasons, central bankers\nmay be better off avoiding monetary strategies and instead relying on more targeted and lower-\ncost alternative approaches to manage bubbles, such as financial regulatory and supervisory\ntools. I will turn to that topic in just a minute.\nIn summary, when it comes to using monetary policy to deflate asset bubbles, we must\nacknowledge the difficulty of identifying bubbles, and uncertainties in the relationship between\nmonetary policy and financial stability. At the same time though, policymakers often must act\non the basis of incomplete knowledge. What has become patently obvious is that not dealing\nwith certain kinds of bubbles before they get big can have grave consequences. This lends more\nweight to arguments in favor of attempting to mitigate bubbles, especially when a credit boom is\nthe driving factor. I would not advocate making it a regular practice to use monetary policy to\nlean against asset price bubbles. However recent experience has made me more open to action.\nI can now imagine circumstances that would justify leaning against a bubble with tighter\nmonetary policy. Clearly further research may help clarify these issues.14\n14 The following conference volumes provide an introduction and references to the research literature now available:\nAsset Price Bubbles: The Implications for Monetary, Regulatory, and International Policies, ed. William Hunter,\nGeorge Kaufman, and Michael Pomerleano (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2003); Asset Prices and Monetary Policy,\ned. Anthony Richards and Tim Robinson (Reserve Bank of Australia, 2003).\n(http://www.rba.gov.au/PublicationsAndResearch/Conferences/2003/index.html)\n12\n\nAnother important tool for financial stability\nRegardless of one’s views on using monetary policy to reduce bubbles, it seems plain that\nsupervisory and regulatory policies could help prevent the kinds of problems we now face.\nIndeed, this was one of Minsky’s major prescriptions for mitigating financial instability. I am\nheartened that there is now widespread agreement among policymakers and in Congress on the\nneed to overhaul our supervisory and regulatory system, and broad agreement on the basic\nelements of reform.15\nMany of the proposals under discussion are intended to strengthen micro-prudential\nsupervision. Micro-prudential supervision aims to insure that individual financial institutions,\nincluding any firm with access to the safety net, but particularly those that are systemically\nimportant, are well managed and avoid excessive risk. The current system of supervision is\ncharacterized by uneven and fragmented supervision, and it’s riddled with gaps that enhance the\nopportunity for regulatory arbitrage. Such arbitrage was a central component in the excessive\nrisk-taking that led to our current problems. It is now widely agreed that such gaps and overlaps\nmust be eliminated, and systemically important institutions—whether banks, insurance firms,\ninvestment firms, or hedge funds—should be subject to consolidated supervision by a single\nagency. Systemic institutions would be defined by key characteristics, such as size, leverage,\nreliance on short-term funding, importance as sources of credit or liquidity, and\n15 See, for example, Timothy Geithner, Testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, March 26, 2009\n(http://www.ustreas.gov/press/releases/tg67.htm); Ben S.

Another\ncritical shortcoming of the current system is that it lacks any legal process to enable supervisors\nof financial conglomerates and nonbanks to wind down the activities of failed firms in an orderly\nfashion. The need for a resolution framework that would permit such wind-downs of\nsystemically important firms is also widely accepted.\nThe current crisis has afforded plentiful opportunities for supervisors to reflect on the\neffectiveness of our current system of micro-prudential supervision. The “lessons learned” will\nundoubtedly enhance its conduct going forward.16 But, regardless of how well micro-prudential\nsupervision is executed, on its own it will never be adequate to safeguard the economy from the\ndestructive boom and bust cycles that Minsky considered endemic in capitalistic systems.\nAnalogous to Keynes’ paradox of thrift, the assumption that safe institutions automatically result\nin a safe system reflects a fallacy of composition. Thus, macro-prudential supervision—to\nprotect the system as a whole—is needed to mitigate financial crises.\nThe roles of micro- and macro-prudential supervision are fundamentally different. In\nprinciple, many individual institutions could be managing risk reasonably well, while the system\nas a whole remained vulnerable due to interconnections among financial institutions that could\nlead to contagious cycles of loss and illiquidity. For example, it is prudent for institutions to sell\nrisky assets and pay off debt when a decline in asset prices depletes capital. But the\nsimultaneous behavior of many institutions to protect themselves in this way only intensifies the\ndecline in prices. Moreover, when many institutions try to de-lever simultaneously, market\n16 See President’s Working Group on Financial Markets, “Policy Statement on Financial Market Developments,”\nMarch 13. 2008 (http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/reports/pwgpolicystatemktturmoil_03122008.pdf); Financial\nStability Forum, “Report of the Financial Stability Forum on Enhancing Market and Institutional Resilience,” April\n7, 2008 (http://www.fsforum.org/publications/r_0804.pdf); Senior Supervisors Group, “Observations on Risk\nManagement Practices during the Recent Market Turbulence,” March 6, 2008.\n(http://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/banking/2008/SSG_Risk_Mgt_doc_final.pdf)\n14\n\nliquidity can instantly evaporate. Systemic risk is endogenous to the working of the financial\nsystem.\nCapital requirements could serve as a key tool of macro-prudential supervision. Most\nproposals for regulatory reform would impose higher capital requirements on systemically\nimportant institutions and also design them to vary in a procyclical manner. In other words,\ncapital requirements would rise in economic upswings, so that institutions would build strength\nin good times, and they would fall in recessions. This pattern would counteract the natural\ntendency of leverage to amplify business cycle swings—serving as a kind of “automatic\nstabilizer” for the financial system. Financial stability might also be enhanced by reforming the\naccounting rules governing loan loss reserves. A more forward-looking system for reserving\nagainst such losses could make regulatory capital less sensitive to economic fluctuations.17 In\naddition, most proposals for financial reform emphasize the need for stronger liquidity standards.\nThe funding of long-term assets with short-term, often overnight liabilities, is a source of\nsystemic vulnerability. One interesting recent proposal would disincent overreliance on short-\nterm funding by relating an institution’s capital charges to the degree of maturity mismatch\nbetween its assets and liabilities.18 There has been considerable discussion recently of the need\nfor a new macro-prudential or “financial stability” supervisor—whether the Fed or some other\nagency—with responsibility to monitor, assess, and mitigate systemic risks in the financial\nsystem as a whole.\nAt this stage, the proposed reforms involve broad principles. The translation of those\nprinciples into a detailed supervisory program will be challenging, to say the least. But I am\n17 See Eric S.

    "text": "For release of delivery\n8:45 a.m. EDT\nApril 15, 2014\nRemarks by\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s 2014 Financial Markets Conference\nAtlanta, Georgia\nApril 15, 2014\n\nGood morning. I’m delighted to have this opportunity to speak to you today, even\nthough I am unable to be with you in person. I’d like to share a few thoughts about the\nimportant issues that the Financial Markets Conference (FMC) is addressing this year.\nMany of these issues, of course, are ones the FMC has grappled with every year since the\ncrisis, an event which elevated the importance of this gathering and of the vital\ncontributions made by the research and the policy discussion the FMC fosters.\nOne of those issues is liquidity. Maturity transformation is a central part of the\neconomic function of banks and many other types of financial intermediaries. But as we\nsaw in the crisis, maturity transformation also exposes intermediaries to liquidity risk,\nparticularly when intermediaries are heavily reliant on short-term wholesale funding. In\n2007 and 2008, short-term creditors ran from firms such as Northern Rock, Bear Stearns,\nand Lehman Brothers, and from money market mutual funds and asset-backed\ncommercial paper programs. Together, these runs were the primary engine of a financial\ncrisis from which the United States and the global economy have yet to fully recover.\nIn response to the crisis, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s first task\nwas to strengthen bank capital requirements through the adoption of the Basel III capital\naccord and, last summer, our domestic rule implementing the Basel III capital\nrequirements in the United States. Strong bank capital rules remain the foundation of\nbank regulation. But capital requirements as currently constructed are generally based on\ncredit and market risks from the asset side of the balance sheet and from off-balance-\nsheet transactions. They do not directly address liquidity risk.\nThus, the Basel Committee’s second task was to develop new liquidity standards\nfor global banking firms: the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Net Stable\n\n- 2 -\nFunding Ratio (NSFR). The LCR is designed to improve a bank’s ability to withstand\nsevere short-term liquidity stress events by requiring banking firms to hold a buffer of\nhighly liquid assets to cover net cash outflows in a 30-day stress scenario. The NSFR is\nmeant to promote resilience over a one-year horizon by requiring banks that hold less\nliquid assets to fund their activities with more stable sources of funding.\nAs others have observed, the new Basel liquidity standards address financial\nstability risks associated with excessive maturity transformation through at least two\nchannels.\nFirst, the new standards insulate banks from liquidity shocks. In the case of the\nLCR, requiring firms to hold a buffer of highly liquid assets will help to ensure that they\nhave a means of generating liquidity in the event of creditor runs. In the case of the\nNSFR, requiring firms to use higher levels of stable funding for less liquid assets reduces\nthe vulnerabilities of a firm to structural maturity mismatches. Banking firms that self-\ninsure against liquidity risk in these ways are less likely to need government liquidity\nsupport in times of stress.\nSecond, the new standards provide an incentive for firms to move to more stable\nfunding structures. Under the LCR and NSFR, firms that engage in unstable forms of\nmaturity transformation will be required to maintain buffers of highly liquid assets and\nuse stable funding, both of which will impose costs for the firms. Reducing the amount\nof maturity transformation they engage in will help firms minimize these costs.\nWhile the LCR and NSFR are important steps forward, they do not fully address\nthe financial stability concerns associated with short-term wholesale funding. These\nstandards tend to focus on the liquidity positions of firms taken in isolation, rather than\n\n- 3 -\non the financial system as a whole. They only apply to internationally active banks, and\nnot directly to shadow banks, despite the fact that liquidity shocks within the shadow\nbanking system played a major role in the crisis. Furthermore, the current versions of the\nLCR and NSFR do not address financial stability risks associated with so-called matched\nbooks of securities financing transactions.\nFederal Reserve staff are actively considering additional measures that could\naddress these and other residual risks in the short-term wholesale funding markets. Some\nof these measures--such as requiring firms to hold larger amounts of capital, stable\nfunding, or highly liquid assets based on use of short-term wholesale funding--would\nlikely apply only to the largest, most complex banking organizations. Other measures--\nsuch as minimum margin requirements for repurchase agreements and other securities\nfinancing transactions--could, at least in principle, apply on a marketwide basis. In\ndesigning such measures, we are carefully thinking through questions about the tradeoffs\nassociated with tighter liquidity regulation that will be discussed at this conference.\nWhile these cost-benefit questions are difficult to answer with either certainty or\nprecision, let me highlight one data point that suggests that there may be net social gains\nfrom introducing further reforms to address short-term wholesale funding risks. In 2010,\nthe Basel Committee assessed the long-term economic impact of stronger capital and\nliquidity requirements for global banks. Factoring in the Basel III capital requirements\nand the NSFR, the Basel study suggested that tightening risk-based capital and liquidity\nrequirements would, on net, provide economic benefits, and that benefits would continue\nto accrue at even higher levels of risk-based capital than are part of Basel III.\n\n- 4 -\nWhile it would be a mistake to give undue weight to any one study, this study\nprovides some support for the view that there might be room for stronger capital and\nliquidity standards for large banks than have been adopted so far.\nAs the Board continues to weigh such steps to further strengthen the financial\nsystem, I expect that conferences like the FMC will continue to be a vital part of the\nprocess, providing the ideas, analysis, and debate that will help us make the best possible\njudgments. Thank you for listening and for this opportunity to be a part of this important\nconference.\n.",

    "text": "Presentation to the Commonwealth Club of California\nSan Francisco, CA\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on Tuesday, June 30, 2009, 6:00 PM Pacific time, 9 PM Eastern.\nA View of the Economic Crisis and the Federal Reserve’s Response1\nF\nThank you very much. I’m very glad to be here before this thoughtful and engaged\naudience to talk about the economy and the Federal Reserve’s response. The Fed has faced\nextraordinary challenges over the past two years and these challenges continue as this very\npainful recession grinds on. I don’t have to tell you how difficult these times have been for the\nAmerican people. You are reminded of it every time you look at your retirement portfolio or\nhear about rising foreclosures and plunging home values. Your businesses may be squeezed as\ncustomers retreat and credit remains scarce. You may have seen colleagues get pink slips or you\nyourselves may be struggling to find a job. I’m happy to offer some good news: We’ve seen\nencouraging signs lately that the economy is poised to turn the corner. But as California’s 11.5\npercent unemployment rate attests, we still find ourselves slogging through the starkest economic\nlandscape most of us have known in our lifetimes.\nFor economic policymakers, this crisis has been like a hundred-year flood—a disaster of\nthe highest order which has put us on a continuous emergency footing. That is especially true at\nthe Federal Reserve—the institution where I serve as one of 12 regional bank presidents—which\nis charged with promoting maximum employment and controlling inflation. Later in my talk, I’ll\ndescribe how we’ve responded to what not so long ago seemed perilously close to financial and\neconomic meltdown. For now, all I’ll say is that, in the face of unprecedented challenges, we’ve\n1 I would like to thank John Williams and Sam Zuckerman for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n\ndeveloped a number of creative programs far beyond the confines of our usual focus on interest\nrates to make sure that everything that reasonably could be done to get the economy turned\naround is being done.\nI want to start by discussing where the economy has been and where I see it going over\nthe next few years. As always, my comments represent my own views and not necessarily those\nof my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System. To understand where we’re headed, it’s useful\nto review how we got to the present situation. I think it’s helpful to divide the recent turmoil,\nlike a play, into three acts. I hope the curtain is now rising on the final act, one defined by\neconomic recovery.\nThe first act began early in the new century, amid a frenzied housing boom and a\nmortgage market where loans were available to just about everyone on unbelievably generous\nterms. Interest rates were unusually low, partly because of a huge supply of foreign savings that\nflooded the U.S. market and partly because the Fed promoted very low interest rates after the\ntech bubble burst to prevent deflation.2 With money so cheap, investors borrowed to the hilt and\nF F\ntook ever-greater risks in search of higher returns.\nIt may be that investors—and regulators too—got overly complacent. Many had come to\nbelieve that the new and mind-bendingly complex forms of financial engineering that had swept\nWall Street virtually guaranteed the safety of banks and investment firms. A new era had\ndawned: financial innovation and sophisticated risk management had changed the rules. What’s\nmore, the business cycle had been tamed. For two decades, recessions had been rare and mild.\n2 See Bernanke (2005) for a discussion of the global influences on interest rates. See Taylor (2009) for a critical\nevaluation of U.S. monetary policy during this period.\n2\n\nThis whole process fed on itself. In the housing market, loan standards became\nincreasingly lax. Investors had an insatiable appetite for securities created from home loans,\nbuying them by the truckload from the institutions that made the loans, even though they offered\nreturns just a shade higher than ultra-safe U.S. Treasury securities. These risky practices spread\nfar beyond the subprime mortgage market where they were most visible, reaching into all kinds\nof credit products around the world.\nThis brings us to the second act of the play. House prices leaped higher every year,\nthanks to this frothy financial market. But they couldn’t go up forever. Once they started to fall\nin 2006, loan delinquencies surged and the sophisticated financial engineering collapsed. The\nfinancial system spread those losses like a runaway infection. Banks and investment firms\naround the world saw the value of their housing-related investments plummet, in some cases\nthreatening their solvency. The financial engineering was so unfathomable that it was nearly\nimpossible to identify which institutions were safe and which were in jeopardy. That prompted\nfinancial firms to hunker down and avoid lending money to anybody.\nThis all came to a head last fall. The weakest links in the financial chain were unable to\nborrow the money they needed to meet day-to-day obligations—a classic liquidity crisis. And\nwhen the venerable Wall Street firm Lehman Brothers collapsed, the system broke down\nentirely. The financial markets that banks and businesses rely on to fund daily operations froze\nup. The value of investments held by financial institutions plunged as everyone tried to sell\nwhatever they could to raise cash. Even the most solid institutions feared for their lives.\nSuch a breakdown of the financial system had the direst implications for the broader\neconomy, threatening to choke off credit to households and Main Street businesses. For\n3\n\nCongress, the Fed, the Treasury Department, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, it\nwas a signal to take emergency steps to keep credit flowing to the economy. Congress approved\nthe TARP program and it was quickly used to provide capital to banks. And the Fed created\nnever-before-seen programs to stabilize money market mutual funds and the short-term\ncommercial paper market. In addition, the Fed and Treasury jointly intervened to support\nimportant institutions whose collapse was judged to threaten the entire financial system.\nI am not going to go into detail about the alphabet soup of Fed programs created during\nthis period. But I want to stress that these policies—in some cases improvised in very short\norder—did succeed in averting a full-blown meltdown. The panic of 2008 subsided.\nIncreasingly, banks and corporations have been able to raise funds on reasonable terms.\nConfidence in the financial system is slowly returning.\nStill, our brush with financial collapse came at great cost. As financial institutions\nstruggled to survive, they cut back on lending. And private securitization markets seized up\nentirely. These are markets in which a variety of types of loans, including auto, student, credit\ncard, Small Business Administration, jumbo mortgage, and commercial real estate loans, are\npackaged as securities and sold to investors. The resulting massive credit crunch caused the\neconomy to nosedive in the final quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year. Job losses\nreached more than 700,000 per month and the unemployment rate skyrocketed to levels not seen\nsince the early 1980s, reaching 9.4 percent in May. Some 6 million jobs vaporized during the\nrecession. Each of these was once held by a real human being, who likely depended on that\npaycheck to pay the mortgage, buy the groceries, and put gas in the car. The loss of these jobs is\nan immense tragedy. We should never forget that this awful recession is a flesh-and-blood thing\nthat robs our families, neighbors, and friends of their livelihood.\n4\n\nEarlier I described some of the emergency measures the Fed has taken to prop up the\nfinancial system. Now I’d like to talk about the policies we’ve adopted to fight the recession\ndirectly. Our policymaking body is called the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC. It\nconsists of the presidents of the Fed’s regional banks, like me, plus the governors of the Federal\nReserve Board in Washington, including Chairman Ben Bernanke. Traditionally, our main\nmonetary policy tool is the federal funds rate, which is what banks charge each other for\novernight loans. We control this rate by pumping cash into the banking system or withdrawing\nit. This is a powerful tool because the interest banks pay to borrow determines what they charge\nfor loans and ultimately works its way through to the rates businesses and households pay for\ncredit. This December, we cut the federal funds rate essentially to zero—an extraordinary step\non its own—and we’ve said repeatedly that low rates would likely be warranted “for an extended\nperiod.” As a result, many other interest rates in the economy are at very low levels. Other\nmajor central banks have taken similar steps.\nStill, given the depth of the crisis we’ve faced, a near-zero federal funds rate hasn’t been\nenough to turn the economy around. So we’ve developed a variety of alternative ways to\nstimulate the economy. For example, we’ve become a major buyer of securities issued by the\ngiant mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a move that has helped push\nconforming mortgage interest rates to near-record low levels—a support to the housing sector,\nwhich is under tremendous duress. In addition, the FOMC launched a program to purchase large\nquantities of longer-term Treasury debt, to help bring down corporate bond and other rates that\nare linked to Treasury yields. In total, the FOMC has committed up to $1.75 trillion—that is,\ntrillion with a “T”—for these asset purchases by the end of this year.\n5\n\nThe Fed and other government bodies have also worked hard to put our banking sector on\na more secure footing. The recent stress tests of the 19 largest U.S. banks provided a thorough\nevaluation of their financial health and capital needs. Since these tests, many banks have raised\ncapital or issued debt without FDIC guarantees—a very encouraging sign.\nIn addition, the Fed and Treasury Department jointly developed the Term Asset-Backed\nSecurities Loan Facility, or TALF, program to help revive vital securitization markets.\nSecuritization is one of the great financial innovations of the last generation, greatly expanding\nthe market for these loans and reducing their cost compared with the days when banks and other\nfront-line lenders had to keep such credits in their own portfolios. There’s no question that\nsecuritization of certain types of loans like subprime mortgages contributed to the crisis. But we\nmust not throw out the baby with the bath water. Securitization markets will continue to play a\nmajor role in our financial system. As I mentioned, in the midst of the financial storm late last\nyear, these markets froze up entirely, with the exception of the market for mortgage-backed\nsecurities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. That made it tough, if not impossible, for\nordinary people to borrow to buy a car, pay college tuition, or finance a business. Restoring\nsecuritization markets to health is one of the key challenges we face. Our TALF program got off\nto a slow start, but is now clearly helping to bring rates down and increase the issuance of a wide\nrange of securitized loan products.\nWe now come to the present—the third act—in which the economy hopefully recovers.\nRight now, we’re like a patient in intensive care whose condition has stabilized and whose fever\nis just starting to come down. We’re just completing the sixth quarter of recession, but the pace\nof decline has slowed markedly. The news during the past few months has been encouraging.\nEven though house prices are continuing to fall in most markets, housing sales and new\n6\n\nconstruction appear to have stabilized. Consumers have recovered some spirit and their spending\nhas also stabilized, thanks in part to government stimulus programs. Payrolls are still shrinking\nat an awful pace, but the momentum of job losses has slowed considerably in the past two\nmonths.\nFinancial markets are in much better shape today than we ever would have dreamed six\nmonths ago. Investors have gone from disregarding risk, to being paralyzed by it, to once again\nbeing willing to take on a reasonable bit. The stock market has rallied and investor appetite for\ncorporate bonds and other assets has rebounded, restoring access to capital for healthy\ncompanies. Even so, I am concerned that mortgage rates, which have risen of late, could place a\ndrag on a still very sick housing market, potentially driving home prices still lower and pushing\nmore borrowers into foreclosure. The recent run-up in oil prices may also reflect greater\nconfidence in the global outlook. But it too is troublesome because it impedes recovery by\nforcing consumers and businesses to pay more for gas and energy, thereby reducing their ability\nto buy other goods and services.\nStill, I expect the recession will end sometime later this year. That would make it the\nlongest and probably deepest downturn since the Great Depression. Growth will come from a\nvariety of sources. One is federal government spending resulting from the stimulus program\npassed by Congress earlier this year. This package provides tax cuts that leave more cash in\nconsumers’ pockets, as well as direct government spending increases that add to payrolls and\nboost economic output. But it will take more than fiscal policy to really get the economy moving\nforward.\n7\n\nFortunately, some sectors are poised to rebound. For example, the auto industry has cut\nback production so far that inventories have begun to shrink—even in the face of historically\nweak demand for motor vehicles. As the economy stabilizes, just slowing the pace of this\ninventory shrinkage will boost gross domestic product, or GDP, which is the nation’s total output\nof goods and services. This story holds through broad sectors of the economy, where cautious\nconsumers and businesses have cut back on purchases of durable goods, such as computers and\nappliances. Eventually, old and broken-down goods will need to be replaced, and the resulting\ndemand will add to economic growth.\nThe housing sector too will eventually rise from the ashes. Home construction has fallen\ndramatically over the past few years as the nation works off the massive overbuilding of the\nboom years. But, once this adjustment is complete, housing construction will need to increase\nsignificantly just to keep pace with the growth in the number of households. Finally, the vicious\ncycle of tight credit and a weak economy can turn into a virtuous cycle. Once the economy starts\ngrowing and jobs and income are increasing, fewer borrowers will default and lenders will be\nwilling to increase the supply of credit.\nI don’t like taking the wind out of the sails of our economic expansion, but a few\ncautionary points should be considered. I expect the pace of the recovery will be frustratingly\nslow. It’s often the case that growth in the first year after a recession is very rapid. That’s what\nhappened as we came out of a very deep downturn in the early 1980s. Although I sincerely wish\nwe would repeat that performance, I don’t think we will. In past deep recessions, the Fed was\nable to step on the accelerator by cutting the federal funds rate sharply, causing the economy to\nshoot ahead. This time, we already have our foot planted firmly on the floor. We can’t take the\nfederal funds rate any lower than zero. I believe that the Fed’s novel programs are stimulating\n8\n\nthe flow of credit, but they simply aren’t as powerful levers as large rate cuts, so this time\nmonetary policy alone can’t power a rapid recovery.\nHistory also teaches us that it often takes a long time to recover from downturns caused\nby financial crises.3 In particular, financial institutions and markets won’t heal overnight. Our\nF F\nmajor banks have made excellent progress in establishing the capital buffers needed to continue\nlending even through a downturn that is more serious than we anticipate. But they are still\nnursing their wounds and credit will remain tight for some time to come.\nI also think that a massive shift in consumer behavior is under way—one that will\nproduce great benefits in the long run but slow our recovery in the short term.4 American\nF F\nhouseholds entered this recession stretched to the limit with mortgage and other debt. The\npersonal saving rate fell from around 8 percent of disposable income two decades ago to almost\nzero. Households financed their lifestyles by drawing on increasing stock market and housing\nwealth, and taking on higher levels of debt. But falling house and stock prices have destroyed\ntrillions of dollars in wealth, cutting off those ready sources of cash. What’s more, the stark\nrealities of this recession have scared many households straight, convincing them that they need\nto save larger fractions of their incomes. In the long run, higher saving promises to channel\nresources from consumption to investment, making capital more readily available to retool\nindustry and fix our infrastructure. But, in the here and now, such a rediscovery of thrift means\nfewer sales at the mall, and fewer jobs on assembly lines and store counters.\n3 See Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) for evidence on this issue.\n4 See Glick and Lansing (2009) for a discussion of household deleveraging.\n9\n\nA fourth factor that could slow recovery is the unprecedented global nature of the\nrecession.5 Neither we nor our trading partners can count on a boost from strong foreign\nF F\ndemand. Finally, developments in the labor market suggest it could take several years to return\nto full employment. During this recession, an unusually high proportion of layoffs have been\npermanent as opposed to temporary, meaning workers won’t get called back when conditions\nimprove. Also, we’ve seen an unprecedented level of involuntary part-time work, such as state\nworkers on furlough a few days per month. Those workers are likely to return to full-time status\nbefore new workers are hired. To summarize, I expect that we will turn the growth corner\nsometime later this year, but I am not optimistic that the economy will spring back to normal\nanytime soon. What’s more, I expect the unemployment rate to remain painfully high for several\nmore years.\nThat’s a dreary prediction, but there is also some risk that things could turn out worse.\nHigh on my worry list is the possibility of another shock to the still-fragile financial system.\nCommercial real estate is a particular danger zone. Property prices are falling and vacancy rates\nare rising in many parts of the country. Given the weak economy, prices could fall more rapidly\nand developers could face tough times rolling over their loans. Many banks are heavily exposed\nto commercial real estate loans. An increase in defaults could add to their financial stress,\nprompting them to tighten credit. The Fed and Treasury are providing loans to investors in\nsecuritized commercial mortgages, which should be a big help. But a risk remains of a severe\nshakeout in this sector.\nLet me now turn to an issue that has lately garnered a great deal of attention—inflation.\nJust a short time ago, most economists were casting a wary eye on the risk of deflation—that is\n5 See IMF (2009) for a discussion of the global economic outlook.\n10\n\nthat prices might drop, perhaps falling into a downward spiral that would squeeze the life out of\nthe economy. Now, though, all I hear about is the danger of an outbreak of high inflation.\nI’ll put my cards on the table right away. I think the predominant risk is that inflation\nwill be too low, not too high, over the next several years. I take 2 percent as a reasonable\nbenchmark for the rate of inflation that is most compatible with the Fed’s dual mandate of price\nstability and maximum employment. This is also the figure that a majority of FOMC members\ncited as their long-run forecast for inflation, according to the minutes of the committee’s April\nmeeting.\nFirst of all, this very weak economy is, if anything, putting downward pressure on wages\nand prices. We have already seen a noticeable slowdown in wage growth and reports of wage\ncuts have become increasingly prevalent—a sign of the sacrifices that some workers are making\nto keep their employers afloat and preserve their jobs. Businesses are also cutting prices and\nprofit margins to boost sales. Core inflation—a measure that excludes volatile food and energy\nprices—has drifted down below 2 percent. With unemployment already substantial and likely to\nrise further, the downward pressure on wages and prices should continue and could intensify.\nFor these reasons, I expect core inflation will dip to about 1 percent over the next year and\nremain below 2 percent for several years.\nIf the economy fails to recover soon, it is conceivable that this very low inflation could\nturn into outright deflation. Worse still, if deflation were to intensify, we could find ourselves in\na devastating spiral in which prices fall at an ever-faster pace and economic activity sinks more\nand more. But I don’t view this as likely. The vigorous policy actions of the Fed and other\ncentral banks, combined with sizable fiscal stimulus here and abroad, have sent a clear message\n11\n\nthat deflation won’t be tolerated. Based on measures of inflation expectations, the public appears\nconfident that the Fed will adopt policies that will maintain a low, positive rate of inflation.\nEvidently, the credibility that the Fed and other central banks have built over the past few\ndecades in bringing inflation down has spilled over into a belief that we won’t allow inflation to\nget too low either. This does not mean that a short episode of deflation couldn’t occur, but it\nmakes a prolonged and devastating deflationary spiral less likely.\nNone of what I just said will satisfy those who worry about inflation. Indeed, if you\nlisten to popular business news channels, you might hear a drumbeat of concern that the Fed\ncould let inflation get too high. Those who hold this view point to the rise in Treasury yields and\ncommodity prices this year as signs that runaway inflation is on the horizon. They muster three\narguments. The first is that the Fed has pumped up the money supply and expanded its balance\nsheet to fund its financial rescue programs, potentially igniting inflation. The second is that the\nFed runs the risk of repeating the errors of the 1970s by focusing on mistaken views of economic\nslack rather than rising prices. The third is that large fiscal budget deficits will create higher\ninflation. I take all of these concerns very seriously and will address each in turn.\nFirst, I’ll talk about the Fed’s balance sheet. As I discussed earlier, the Fed has taken a\nnumber of strong steps to avert a financial and economic meltdown, and to support the flow of\ncredit. These policies have caused the assets on the Fed’s balance sheet to more than double,\nfrom under $900 billion at the start of the recession to over $2 trillion now. This expansion is\nlargely financed by increases in bank reserves, that is, surplus cash that banks deposit with us.\nSome worry that the Fed’s balance sheet expansion is pumping money into the economy and will\nbe inflationary. But, as I will explain in a moment, we have the tools needed to tighten policy\nand head off future inflation. There is also some concern that the Fed could be trapped by\n12\n\nconflicting goals if, at some point, a growing economy requires a higher federal funds rate,\nbefore credit markets are fully healed. Finally, some worry that the Fed may lack the political\nwill to tighten policy when the time comes.\nI will be the first to say that it is always difficult to get monetary policy just right. But the\nFed’s analytical prowess is top-notch and our forecasting record is second to none. The FOMC\nis committed to price stability and has a solid track record in achieving it. With respect to our\ntool kit, we certainly have the means to unwind the stimulus when the time is right. Many of the\nspecial programs we developed to provide emergency credit to the financial system are already\ntapering off as market conditions improve. Many of the assets that we have accumulated during\nthe crisis, such as Treasury and mortgage-backed agency securities, have ready markets. And\nthe Fed can push up the federal funds rate by raising the rate of interest that we pay to banks on\nthe reserve balances they have on deposit with us—authority that was granted to us by Congress\nlast year. An increase in the interest rate on reserves will induce banks to lend money to us\nrather than to other banks and borrowers, thereby pushing up the federal funds rate and other\nrates charged to private borrowers throughout the economy. The ability to pay interest on\nreserves is an important tool because, as I mentioned, it’s conceivable that, even if the economy\nrebounds nicely, the credit crunch might not be fully behind us and some financial markets might\nstill need Fed support. This tool will enable us to tighten credit conditions even though our\nbalance sheet wouldn’t shrink.\nLet me turn to the second concern, that we could have a rerun of the stagflation of the\n1970s. Some economists have argued that the Fed misjudged how low the unemployment rate\ncould go without igniting inflation and, as a result, lowered the federal funds rate too far for too\n13\n\nlong, an overly accommodative stance that contributed to runaway prices.6 This is an issue we\nF F\nhave studied in great depth, looking at a wide range of data sources and using a variety of\ntechniques to estimate slack in labor and product markets. Not surprisingly, these estimates\nvary. But they all plainly show that labor and product markets are currently operating well\nbelow the levels that would trigger inflation. We must beware of overconfidence that we have\ntoo precise a handle on these questions. But, to me, the evidence is clear that the economy has\nsubstantial slack and we are far from the kinds of unemployment rates that would make inflation\na danger.\nThe third concern is that big federal budget deficits might eventually be inflationary. In\nmy years of teaching at Berkeley, I regularly lectured on the relationship between fiscal deficits\nand inflation. A glance at history shows that many countries with massive structural deficits and\nwithout an independent central bank turned to the printing press to pay off their debts. That’s a\nrecipe for high inflation and, in some cases, hyperinflation.\nBut I don’t believe the United States faces that threat. Looking back in history, runaway\nfiscal deficits have often been accompanied by high inflation.7 But, since World War II, such a\nF F\nrelationship has only held in developing countries.8 In countries with advanced financial\nF F\nsystems and histories of low inflation, no such connection is found.\nSo where exactly do the dangers with fiscal deficits lie? To answer that question, it’s\nimportant to distinguish between cyclical deficits and long-run or structural deficits. The recent\nsharp rise in the federal deficit in large part stems from the government’s appropriate response to\n6 See, for example, Orphanides (2002).\n7 See Sargent (1982) for a discussion of the fiscal sources of high inflation.\n8 See Fischer et al. (2002) and Catao and Terrones (2005) for analysis of the relationship between deficits and\ninflation in the post-World War II period.\n14\n\na severe recession and financial crisis. These near-term cyclical deficits vastly overstate the\nproblem of ongoing structural deficits. But the United States does have a large structural budget\ndeficit, and it will remain when the economy finally recovers. To a great extent, the structural\nbudget gap reflects demographic shifts resulting in an aging population coupled with a chronic\nescalation in health-care costs. The issue of rising entitlement and health-care spending is not\nnew. In fact, I spent many of my waking hours grappling with these problems a decade ago\nwhen I chaired the Council of Economic Advisers in the Clinton administration.\nIt is essential that we come to grips with structural budget deficits, but not because such\ndeficits will cause inflation. It’s because large, sustained structural deficits vacuum up savings\nthat could be put to more productive uses. Once the economy is back on track, these deficits will\nmake capital more expensive for private borrowers, crowding out the investments that are\nessential to boost productivity and fuel growth in real wages and living standards.\nConsider the case of the large deficits in the United States in the 1980s. We did not see a\nrun-up in inflation then. On the contrary, the deficits soared just as inflation was coming down.\nThose deficits did, however, contribute to higher interest rates, which made education and\ninvestment more expensive. Japan provides another example. Japan has run very large fiscal\ndeficits through much of the past two decades, yet its problem is persistent deflation—precisely\nthe opposite of inflation.\nFinally, there’s the matter of whether the Fed’s resolve is firm enough to tighten policy\nwhen the time comes to do so. Let me be unequivocal. The Fed is committed to doing\neverything in its power to foster recovery while maintaining price stability. When it’s necessary\nto withdraw the extraordinary stimulus we have put in place, we won’t hesitate. The Fed was\n15\n\ncreated as a politically independent central bank, and that tradition is deeply embedded in our\nculture and practice. We have worked closely with the Treasury and other agencies during this\ncrisis, and it was appropriate to do so. But, in our conduct of monetary policy, we are guided\nsolely by our statutory mandates of maximum employment and price stability. In March, the\nTreasury Department and the Fed signed an accord reaffirming our independence in setting\nmonetary policy.\nIn sum, although I take these concerns about inflation seriously, I do not believe that\nthere is a real threat of high inflation in the current situation. Monetary policy fosters inflation\nwhen it loosens financial conditions enough to create excess demand for goods and services.\nWhat could be clearer than the fact that right now we need more demand—not less—to offset the\nslack in labor and product markets?\nIf anything, I’m more concerned that we will be tempted to tighten policy too soon,\nthereby aborting recovery. That’s just what happened in 1936 when, following two years of\nrobust recovery, the Fed tightened policy because it was worried about large quantities of excess\nreserves in the banking system. The result? In 1937, the economy plunged back into a deep\nrecession.9 Japan too learned that hard lesson in the 1990s, when both monetary and fiscal\nF F\npolicies were tightened in the mistaken belief that the economy was rebounding.\nThese episodes teach us a valuable lesson that we should heed in the present situation.\nLet this not be another 1937, but a time when policymakers have the wisdom and patience to\nnurse the economy back to health.

Wright and Janet L. Norwood\ninto the Department of Labor’s Hall of Honor\nU.S. Department of Labor\nWashington, D.C.\nOctober 20, 2015\n\nWe are here to honor two exceptional public servants and the great institution\nthey helped build. Let’s consider for a moment why the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)\nhas succeeded and how Carroll Wright and Janet Norwood contributed to that success.\nIn 1884, a time of great strife and mistrust between management and labor, the\nfederal government created an agency with the mission of providing detailed and\nobjective information on American workers. That task fell to Carroll Wright, who had\nwon the confidence of workers and management as chief of the Massachusetts Bureau of\nLabor Statistics in the years after that state became the first to legalize labor unions.\nAt that point, before the United States itself had recognized such rights and before\nthe federal government could agree on labor standards, the public needed an\nunimpeachable assessment of the conditions faced by workers. Under Carroll Wright,\nwhat was then called the Bureau of Labor investigated major labor disputes and issued\nreports that shaped public opinion and were the basis for executive action and legislation.\nHe initiated the collection of data on hours, wages, and prices and was responsible for\nmany important advances that successively improved the reliability of these data. The\nrespect for the thoroughness and objectivity of the research that Wright oversaw led to\nthe dismantling of damaging trade barriers in the 1890s and later raised public awareness\nabout the deplorable conditions faced by women in the workplace.\nIn the U.S. Constitution, there is not a requirement that government statistics be\naccurate and free of political influence or bias. Carroll Wright recognized that this\nsimple, powerful idea could help build public confidence for the government’s effort to\nreduce conflicts between management and workers and move our nation forward. He and\nothers are responsible for a fundamental feature of our democracy that is now often taken\n\n- 2 -\nfor granted--the public’s expectation and insistence that information provided by the\ngovernment can be trusted. To Carroll Wright’s descendants, one of whom is with us\ntoday, thank you, on his behalf, for this valuable contribution.\nThis legacy lives on in the agency Carroll Wright founded, and few of his\nsuccessors did as much to advance this principle as Janet Norwood. One reason for this\nsuccess, I am sure, is that she rose from the ranks, and the values of the BLS were deeply\ningrained in her over the 28 years she served this agency. Those who worked with Janet\nsay she strongly believed the BLS was uniquely positioned to contribute to the economic\npolicy debate as an authoritative, unimpeachable source of information and analysis\nabout the economy.\nIn her 13 years as commissioner, Janet succeeded in winning support for an\nambitious expansion of the BLS. She launched the annual Consumer Expenditure\nSurvey, as well as many other important data series, and elevated the skills and quality of\nstatistical analysis throughout the agency. To supplement the traditional measurement of\nproductivity as output per hour of labor, she oversaw the creation of a new measure of\nmultifactor productivity in the private sector, estimating productivity as the result of both\nlabor and capital inputs. When budget pressures threatened to end important data series\ncollected elsewhere at the Department of Labor, she found the means to continue these\nseries at the BLS.\nAt the same time, Janet faced challenges to the BLS’s tradition of professionalism\nand objectivity. From 1979, when she was appointed by President Carter, to 1991, when\nshe retired, the news on employment, productivity, and inflation was often bad. In this\n\n- 3 -\ncircumstance, the BLS was sometimes accused of overstating economic problems, and it\noccasionally came under pressure to alter the basis for its data.\nJanet Norwood fended off these challenges with a mixture of resolve and\nflexibility, channeling some of the pressure into deliberate and constructive processes that\neventually yielded improvements in the consumer price index and generated alternative\nprice measures. As commissioner and like her predecessors, Janet helped preserve the\nBLS’s deserved reputation for accuracy and integrity by continually improving the\ndesign, procedures, and techniques of data collection.\nAfter government service, Janet had a long and active retirement in which she\ncontinued her contributions to the economic profession and the science of statistics. She\npassed away on March 31 of this year.\nTo members of her family who are with us today, thank you for her extraordinary\nservice to our country. Janet’s legacy continues in the ongoing work of the exceptional\nagency she helped build, on the foundation laid by Carroll Wright, whom she so\nappropriately joins today in this Hall of Honor.\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics is exceptional, and in that way, I hope it serves as\nan example of how effective, reliable, and trusted government can be.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\nMay 1, 2014\n8:30 a.m. EDT\nTailored Supervision of Community Banks\nRemarks\nby\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nIndependent Community Bankers of America\n2014 Washington Policy Summit\nWashington, D.C.\nMay 1, 2014\n\nThank you for inviting me to ICBA’s policy summit. I am pleased to have this\nopportunity to share my views on some of the key issues facing community banks and how I see\nthe community banking model fitting into the financial system in the years ahead. In particular, I\nwill discuss steps the Federal Reserve has taken to address the “too-big-to-fail” problem and how\nthese steps affect community banks; I will describe how the Fed strives to improve our\nunderstanding of the unique role that community banks play in the economy; and then I’ll show\nhow we are using this knowledge to better tailor our supervisory expectations and approaches to\ncommunity banks.\nAs you may know, before I rejoined the Federal Reserve Board as Vice Chair in 2010, I\nhad the privilege of serving for six years as president and chief executive of the Federal Reserve\nBank of San Francisco. The 12th district is the largest of the Fed’s districts, covering nine\nwestern states, and it is home to a significant number of community banks, the majority of which\nare supervised by the San Francisco Fed directly or indirectly through bank holding companies.\nCommunity bankers helped me, when I served as president, to take the pulse of the local\neconomy and also to understand how regulatory and policy decisions in Washington affect\nfinancial institutions of different sizes and types, sometimes in very different ways. During the\nfinancial crisis, I saw firsthand the challenges that community banks faced in a crisis they did\nlittle to cause, and I have felt strongly ever since that the Fed must do what it can to ensure that\nthe actions taken following the crisis do not place undue burdens on your institutions.\nI believe a healthy financial system relies on institutions of different sizes performing a\nvariety of functions and serving different needs. In some communities, your banks are actually\nsituated on Main Street, but all community banks serve Main Street by providing credit to small\nbusiness owners, homebuyers, households, and farmers.\n\n- 2 -\nBecause of their important role, I am pleased that the condition of many community\nbanks has been improving. Although there is still considerable revenue pressure from low\nmargins, earnings for most community banks have rebounded since the financial crisis. Asset\nquality and capital ratios continue to improve, and the number of problem banks continues to\ndecline. Notably, after several years of reduced lending following the recession, we are starting\nto see slow but steady loan growth at community banks. While this expansion in lending must\nbe prudent, on balance I consider this growth an encouraging sign of an improving economy.\nAddressing Too Big to Fail\nLet me begin by discussing an issue that I know has been on the minds of many\ncommunity bankers: how policymakers are addressing the problem of banks that are perceived\nto be too big to fail.1 Community banks share the interest we all have in reducing the systemic\nrisk posed by firms that are large, complex, and interconnected, and also in reducing any\npotential competitive advantages that such firms may enjoy as a result of too-big-to-fail.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act)\naddresses the too-big-to-fail issue through steps intended to limit both the likelihood that\nsystemically important firms would fail and the potential damage from any that do. The Federal\nReserve and the other financial regulatory agencies have issued a number of regulations to\nimplement the requirements set forth in the legislation and to enhance the supervision of the\nlargest financial firms.\n1 This topic has been addressed in greater detail in previous speeches by Federal Reserve governors, including\nDaniel K. Tarullo (2013), “Evaluating Progress in Regulatory Reforms to Promote Financial Stability,” speech\ndelivered at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Washington, May 3; Jerome H. Powell (2013),\n“Ending ‘Too Big to Fail,’” speech delivered at the Institute of International Bankers 2013 Washington Conference,\nWashington, March 4; and Janet L. Yellen (2013), “Regulatory Landscapes: A U.S. Perspective,” speech delivered\nat the International Monetary Conference, Shanghai, June 3. These speeches are available at\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/2013speech.htm.\n\n- 3 -\nBut even before Dodd-Frank became law, the Federal Reserve began to strengthen its\noversight of the largest, most complex banking firms and require these firms to materially\nimprove their capital adequacy. For example, in 2009, we conducted the first stress tests of the\nlargest 19 U.S. bank holding companies. That test has subsequently evolved into our annual\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, known as CCAR, which requires all bank holding\ncompanies with total assets of $50 billion or more to submit annual capital plans for review by\nthe Federal Reserve. CCAR helps ensure that the largest banking organizations will have\nenough capital to continue operating through times of economic and financial stress.2 To be\nclear, as the federal banking agencies have stated previously, these stress testing and capital\nplanning requirements do not, and should not, apply to community banks.3\nIn addition to strengthening requirements for stress testing and capital planning, the\nagencies have also strengthened capital requirements for the largest firms by approving more\nrobust risk-based and leverage capital requirements. Because the financial crisis demonstrated\nthe importance of having adequate levels of high-quality capital at banks of all sizes, many\nelements of the revised capital framework apply to all banking organizations. In designing the\nrevised capital rules, however, the agencies considered financial stability risks and adjusted the\n2 The results of the 2014 CCAR exercise are available on the Federal Reserve’s website. Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System (2014), “Federal Reserve Releases Results of Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review\n(CCAR),” press release, March 26, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20140326a.htm.\nPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve and the other federal banking agencies require banking\norganizations with total consolidated assets between $10 billion and $50 billion to conduct annual company-run\nstress tests. The agencies recently published guidance to clarify supervisory expectations for these firms. See Board\nof Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board of Governors), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC),\nand Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) (2014), “Agencies Issue Final Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test\nGuidance for Medium-Sized Firms,” press release, March 5,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20140305a.htm.\n3 Board of Governors (2012), “Agencies Clarify Supervisory Expectations for Stress Testing by Community Banks,”\npress release, May 14, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20120514b.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nfinal rules to make the requirements substantially more rigorous for the largest, most\nsystemically important banking organizations than for community banks.4\nWhile we have taken a number of steps to address too-big-to-fail concerns, our work is\nnot finished. Because the failure of a systemic institution could impose significant costs on the\nfinancial system and the economy, the Board recently finalized a requirement for the eight large,\nglobally systemic banks to meet a significantly higher leverage requirement than other banking\norganizations. And we are working to implement risk-based capital surcharges for these\nsystemically important firms. We also need to ensure that the new rules are embedded in our\nsupervision of the largest firms; and, we must continue to watch for emerging sources of\nsystemic risk and take steps as appropriate to address these risks.\nOne such risk that the Federal Reserve has been monitoring closely is the reliance of\nsome firms on potentially volatile short-term wholesale funding.5 We are carefully considering\nthe systemic vulnerabilities that may be posed by overreliance on short-term wholesale funding\nand are weighing potential policy responses. While it would be premature to indicate whether or\nhow we might address these vulnerabilities, I can say that few, if any, community banks are\nreliant on levels of short-term wholesale funding that could raise concerns about systemic risk,\nand regulators would carefully consider the ramifications of any action, including the effect on\ncommunity banks.\n4 To help non-complex community banking organizations better understand the new capital rule, the agencies\npublished a guide that summarizes changes to the capital rules for exposures commonly held by such organizations.\nSee Board of Governors, FDIC, and OCC (2013), New Capital Rule: Community Bank Guide (Washington: Board\nof Governors, FDIC, and OCC, July),\nwww.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/basel/files/capital_rule_community_bank_guide_20130709.pdf.\n5 See, for example, Daniel K. Tarullo (2013), “Shadow Banking and Systemic Risk Regulation,” speech delivered at\nthe Americans for Financial Reform and Economic Policy Institute Conference, Washington, November 22,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/tarullo20131122a.htm; and Daniel K. Tarullo (2013), “Macroprudential\nRegulation,” speech delivered at the Yale Law School Conference on Challenges in Global Financial Services, New\nHaven, CT, September 20, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/tarullo20130920a.htm.\n\n- 5 -\nImproving Our Understanding of Community Banks\nIn carefully considering how our actions affect community banks, the Federal Reserve is\ncommitted to understanding your institutions and the challenges you face. We continue to try to\nimprove that understanding in two important ways--research and outreach. The Fed is uniquely\npositioned to employ these two methods because of our traditional strength as a research\ninstitution and because of our structure, with Reserve Banks that have deep roots in communities\nin every region of the country.\nIn the past several years, research staff across the Federal Reserve System who were\nindependently exploring issues related to community banking have developed an informal\nnetwork to share findings and identify areas for further research. After some of the fruits of this\neffort were shared with the Board, we decided to join with the Conference of State Bank\nSupervisors (CSBS) to host a research and policy conference focused on community banks. This\nconference, “Community Banking in the 21st Century,” was held in October 2013 at the Federal\nReserve Bank of St. Louis.6 It was one of very few research conferences to focus specifically\non community banks and also brought together researchers, community bankers, policymakers,\nand bank supervisors to discuss the practical implications of the papers presented.\nAmong the topics that researchers addressed in their papers were the link between bank\nfailures and local economic performance,7 the role of management in the performance of\n6 Conference materials, including research papers, are available on the conference website at\nwww.stlouisfed.org/banking/community-banking-conference/.

At the most basic level, supervisory staff at each Reserve Bank\ngain insights from their regular contact with community bankers. Additional knowledge comes\nby way of community outreach initiatives, which provide the added benefit of informing the Fed\nabout local economic conditions. Here in Washington, in addition to participating in events like\nthis one, the Board of Governors meets twice a year with the Community Depository Institutions\nAdvisory Council (CDIAC).11 The council, which includes representatives from small banks,\ncredit unions, and savings associations from each Federal Reserve district, provides information\nabout economic conditions around the country and those issues that are of greatest concern to\ncommunity institutions.\nIn addition, we have been taking steps to improve our communication with community\nbankers. In that regard, we have been using various platforms to go beyond formal policy\nissuances and better explain our supervisory expectations for community banks. We have also\n8 Dean F. Amel and Robin A.

In particular, we have\ndeveloped two programs--Ask the Fed and Outlook Live--that have become quite popular with\ncommunity bankers who are interested in learning more about topics that are of importance to\nboth banks and supervisors. Ask the Fed is a program for officials of state member banks, bank\nand thrift holding companies, and state bank commissioners. Outlook Live, which is a\ncompanion program to the Federal Reserve’s quarterly Consumer Compliance Outlook\npublication, is a webinar series on consumer compliance issues that is led by Federal Reserve\nstaff.12\nWe are also now using periodic newsletters and other communication tools to highlight\ninformation that community bankers may be interested in knowing and to provide information on\nhow examiners will assess compliance with Federal Reserve policies. In addition to Consumer\nCompliance Outlook, in 2012 the Federal Reserve System established a Community Banking\nConnections website and quarterly newsletter to focus on safety-and-soundness issues that are of\npractical interest to community bankers and bank board members.13 The Federal Reserve also\nlaunched a series of special-purpose publications called FedLinks.14 These publications\nhighlight key elements of specific supervisory topics and discuss how examiners will typically\naddress the topic. The common goal for all of these outreach efforts is building and sustaining\nan ongoing dialogue with community bankers.\n12 Consumer Compliance Outlook is available at www.philadelphiafed.org/bank-resources/publications/consumer-\ncompliance-outlook/, and Outlook Live is available at www.philadelphiafed.org/bank-\nresources/publications/consumer-compliance-outlook/outlook-live/.\n13 Community Banking Connections is available at www.communitybankingconnections.org/.\n14 FedLinks is available at www.communitybankingconnections.org/fedlinks.cfm.\n\n- 8 -\nTailored Community Bank Supervision\nOne theme that has come through loud and clear in this outreach is concern about\nregulatory burden. The financial crisis has prompted significant changes to regulation, so the\nFederal Reserve understands this concern and strives to minimize regulatory burden for all\ninstitutions, including community banks. At the same time, we are taking a fresh look at how we\nsupervise community banks and possible ways that supervision can be smarter, more nimble, and\nmore effective. In that regard, and consistent with my earlier points about too big to fail, we\nknow that a one-size-fits-all approach to supervision is often not appropriate. In recent years, we\nhave taken a number of actions to tailor supervisory expectations to the size and complexity of\nthe banking organizations we supervise.\nThe first step is taking a disciplined approach to judging which supervisory policies\nshould apply to community banking organizations. This involves not only weighing the costs\nand benefits of proposed rules and their implementation, but in some cases also asking whether it\nmakes sense for a specific policy to apply to community banks.\nIn other cases, it may not make sense to exclude community banking organizations\nentirely from the scope of a supervisory policy, but we may be able to scale expectations to the\nsize and complexity of the supervisory portfolio, to minimize the burden where possible and\nappropriate. The final capital rules for community banks that I mentioned earlier illustrate this\nkind of tailoring.\nLet me turn now to upcoming changes in the accounting standard for credit losses on\nloans and securities. We have heard the concern that overly complex accounting rules in this\narea would increase costs with little benefit for the users of community bank financial\nstatements. We are working with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) to help\n\n- 9 -\nensure that the new standard, which is an important component of financial reform efforts, can\nbe implemented in a reasonable and practical way for community banks. We have stressed to\nFASB that its proposal should not require community banks to utilize complex modeling\nprocesses. We expect that a final standard will permit loss-estimation techniques that build upon\ncurrent credit-risk management techniques used by community banks.15 We will work with\ncommunity banks to help implement the new standard when it is final. In addition, our\nsupervisory guidance will emphasize that regulatory expectations for implementation of the\nstandard will differ based on bank size and complexity.\nIn addition to tailoring our rules, we are also taking steps to tailor and improve our\nexamination processes to be more efficient and effective. For example, we are currently in the\nprocess of developing and adopting common technology tools across the Federal Reserve System\nthat should allow our examiners to more effectively focus their time and enhance the consistency\nof our examination processes nationwide.\nFurthermore, we are exploring ways that our community bank examiners may be able to\ncomplete more examination work off site. For example, for banks that have electronic loan files,\nexaminers may be able to read these files off site rather than on the bank premises. We are also\nseeking ways to utilize the financial information that we collect from banks to tailor the\nexamination procedures that are used on site, with less work being required at institutions with\n15 Financial Accounting Standards Board (2012), “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Subtopic 825-15),”\nExposure Draft: Proposed Accounting Standards Update (Norwalk, CT: December 20),\nwww.fasb.org/cs/BlobServer?blobkey=id&blobnocache=true&blobwhere=1175825477164&blobheader=applicatio\nn%2Fpdf&blobheadername2=Content-Length&blobheadername1=Content-\nDisposition&blobheadervalue2=1381874&blobheadervalue1=filename%3DProposed_ASU%25E2%2580%2594Fin\nancial_Instruments%25E2%2580%2594Credit_Losses_%2528_Subtopic_825-\n15%2529.pdf&blobcol=urldata&blobtable=MungoBlobs.\n\n- 10 -\nlower risk profiles. These efforts should reduce the disruption that an on-site examination can\ncause to a bank’s day-to-day operations.\nWe recently adopted a new consumer compliance examination framework for community\nbanks.16 Under this new program, our consumer compliance examiners base examination\nintensity more explicitly on the individual community bank’s risk profile, weighed against the\neffectiveness of the bank’s compliance controls. We expect that examiners will spend less time\non low-risk compliance issues at community banks, increasing the efficiency of our supervision\nand reducing regulatory burden on many community banks.\nMuch of the work to tailor our supervisory requirements and programs is being overseen\nby the community bank subcommittee of the Board’s Committee on Bank Supervision. This\nsubcommittee oversees the supervision of community and regional banks and reviews proposed\nsupervisory policies to help ensure that they are appropriate for, and tailored to, community\nbanks. This subcommittee was formed several years ago under the direction of now former\ngovernors Betsy Duke and Sarah Bloom Raskin, and I want to assure you that the subcommittee\nwill continue to play an important role in helping ensure that our supervisory policies make sense\nfor community banks. I should also add that we are working closely with our colleagues at the\nstate level to help ensure that our supervisory approaches and methodologies are as consistent as\npossible.\nConclusion\n16 Board of Governors, Division of Consumer and Community Affairs (2013), “Community Bank Risk-Focused\nConsumer Compliance Supervision Program,” Consumer Affairs Letter CA 13-19 (November 18),\nwww.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/caletters/caltr1319.htm; and “Consumer Compliance and Community\nReinvestment Act (CRA) Examination Frequency Policy,” Consumer Affairs Letter CA 13-20 (November 18),\nwww.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/caletters/caltr1320.htm.\n\n- 11 -\nIn closing, let me repeat my strong belief that community banks will continue to play an\nimportant role in our financial system in the years ahead, serving the credit needs of the\ncommunities they are a part of and know so well. The Federal Reserve will continue to promote\na stronger and more resilient financial system, while carefully considering the effects of our\nactions on community banks and tailoring supervision appropriately.\nThank you.",

    "text": "Presentation to the Fourth Annual Haas Gala\nSan Francisco, CA\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery October 21, 2005 8:55 PM Pacific Time, 11:55 PM Eastern\nHousing Bubbles and Monetary Policy\nTonight I would like to focus on how the Fed, or central banks, more generally, should\nrespond to asset price bubbles. This is one of the few policy issues where the Fed’s approach has\ncome in for real criticism. I thought it might be of interest to this audience since, one way or\nanother, it has probably touched the life of almost everyone here in the Bay Area. I saw that in\nmemorable ways when I returned to MBA teaching at Haas in the fall of 1999 after a stint in\nWashington including 2½ years as a Governor of the Fed. During one class, I heard some\nbackground buzz. A student in my global macroeconomics class was chattering away on his\ncell phone. I looked his way and frowned. He apologized, explaining that he was finalizing the\ndetails for his internet startup to go public. Those were heady days in the markets, in the Bay\nArea, and at Haas. The Fed suspected there was a stock price bubble developing as early as\n1996. I was still at the Board when Greenspan made his famous irrational exuberance speech.\nThe Fed chose not to try to burst the bubble. Instead, it did its very best to pick up the pieces\nwhen the bubble finally popped. I think that effort was pretty successful. But many observers\nwonder if we erred and think the Fed should have tightened monetary policy sooner.\nThe question is not one of purely historic interest. Today, it’s not stock prices but house\nprices that have been soaring. Those of us who live in the Bay Area know that you can’t get\nthrough a cocktail party without some discussion of an eye-popping price somebody just got for\ntheir two-bedroom, one-bath handyman special.\nBut the Bay Area isn’t the only place in the country, or the world, for that matter, where\nsoaring house prices have raised concerns about national economic stability. In the U.S. as a\nwhole, the share of residential investment in GDP is now at its highest level in decades, and this\nsector has been a key source of strength in the current expansion. The question for policy is: will\nthis source of strength reverse course and become instead a source of weakness? Put more\nbluntly: Is there a house-price “bubble” that might deflate, and if so, what would that mean for\nthe nation’s economy? What, if anything, should policy do beforehand? Fortunately, there is a\nlarge scholarly literature on asset price bubbles and monetary policy, and Haas faculty in finance,\neconomics and real estate have made important contributions.\nThe literature generally defines a bubble as a situation where the price of an asset—in\nthis case, housing—is significantly higher than its fundamental value. One common way of\njudging whether housing’s price is in line with its fundamental value is to consider the ratio of\nhousing prices to rents. This is analogous to the ratio of prices to dividends for stocks. In the\ncase of housing, rents reflect the flow of benefits obtained from housing assets—either the\nmonetary return from rental property, or the value of living in owner-occupied housing.\nHistorically, the ratio for the U.S. has had many ups and downs, but over time it has tended to\nreturn to its long-run average. In other words, when the price-to-rent ratio is high, housing prices\ntend to grow more slowly or fall for a time, and when the ratio is low, prices tend to rise more\n1\n\nrapidly. I want to emphasize, though, that this is a loose relationship that can be counted on only\nfor rough guidance rather than a precise reading.\nCurrently, the ratio for the U.S. is higher than at any time since data became available in\n1970—about 38 percent above its long-run average. Of course, the ratios vary widely from place\nto place in the U.S. and in different countries. For Los Angeles and San Francisco, the price-to-\nrent ratio is about 75 percent higher than the normal level, while for Cleveland the ratio is very\nnear its historical average. For the U.K., the ratio is more than double its long-run average,\nwhereas in Japan it’s only about three-quarters of its normal level.1\nHigher than normal ratios do not necessarily prove that there’s a house-price bubble.\nHouse prices could be high for some good, fundamental reasons. For example, there have been\nchanges in the tax laws that reduce the potential tax bite from selling one home and buying\nanother. Another development, which may be making housing more like an investment vehicle\nin the U.S., is that it’s now easier and cheaper to get at the equity—either through refinancing,\nwhich has become a less costly process, or through an equity line of credit. These innovations in\nmortgage markets make the funds invested in houses more liquid. There are also constraints on\nthe supply of housing in a number of markets, including the Bay Area. Probably the most\nobvious candidate for a fundamental factor is low mortgage interest rates. Even so, the\nconsensus seems to be that the high price-to-rent ratio for housing cannot be fully accounted for\nby these factors. So, while I’m certainly not predicting anything about future house price\nmovements, I think it’s obvious that the housing sector represents a serious issue for monetary\npolicymakers to consider.\nHow, then, should monetary policy react to unusually high prices of houses—or of other\nassets, for that matter? As a starting point, let me note that the issue is not now (nor during the\nstock market boom) whether policy should react at all. As part of its analysis of demand in the\neconomy, central bank models have long incorporated the wealth effect of house prices and other\nassets on spending; it is just one of many factors, including fiscal policy, exchange rates, and so\non, that affect demand. The debate lies in determining when, if ever, policy should be focused on\ndeflating the asset price bubble itself.2\nIn my view, it makes sense to organize one’s thinking around three consecutive\nquestions—three hurdles to jump before pulling the monetary policy trigger. First, if the bubble\nwere to deflate on its own, would the effect on the economy be exceedingly large? Second, is it\nunlikely that the Fed could mitigate the consequences? Third, is monetary policy the best tool to\nuse to deflate a house-price bubble?\nMy answers to these questions in the shortest possible form are, “no,” “no,” and “no.” In\nthe most thorough possible form, my answers might take a few hours, and would give full play to\nthe many gray areas that are involved. Since the short answer is not satisfactory and the\nthorough one overwhelms our time limits, I will compromise and give just a brief explanation for\nmy trio of “nos.”\nIn answer to the first question on the size of the effect, it could be large enough to feel\nlike a good-sized bump in the road, but the economy would likely to be able to absorb the shock.\nFor example, a reversion to the long-run price-rent ratio would appear to represent a shock that is\nonly about half the size of the U.S. stock market collapse in 2000 and 2001.\nIn answer to the second question on timing, the spending slowdown that would ensue is\nlikely to kick in gradually, because it mainly affects household wealth. This is important,\nbecause Fed policy actions don’t have instantaneous effects, but work through the economy over\n2\n\ntime. So the impact of a gradual spending slowdown could well be cushioned by an easier\npolicy.\nIn answer to the third question on whether monetary policy is the best tool to deflate a\nhouse-price bubble, there are several points to consider. For one thing, no one can predict\nexactly how much tightening would be needed, or by exactly how much the bubble should be\nreduced. Beyond that, a tighter policy to deflate a housing bubble could impose substantial costs\non other sectors of the economy that would lead to equally unwelcome imbalances. Finally, it’s\npossible that other strategies, such as tighter supervision or changes in financial regulation,\nwould not only be more tailored to the problem, but also less costly to the economy.\nTaking all of these points into consideration, it seems that the arguments against trying to\ndeflate a bubble outweigh those in favor of it. So, my bottom line is that monetary policy should\nreact to rising prices for houses or other assets only insofar as they affect the central bank’s goal\nvariables—output, employment, and inflation. But I want to stress that the debate surrounding\nthese issues is still very much alive. As I hinted earlier, there are significant “gray areas” to\nconsider, and these, of course, are often the most interesting, because they involve both subtlety\nand the complex interplay of economics, politics, and human psychology.\nI hope that, in these remarks, I have given you some insight into how at least one\npolicymaker is framing the question of whether to respond to house-price bubbles.\n1\nErratum (posted November 7, 2005).

    "text": "For release on delivery\n11:30 a.m. EDT\nMay 21, 2014\nRemarks by\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nNew York University’s 2014 Commencement\nNew York, New York\nMay 21, 2014\n\nThank you, President Sexton. On behalf of the honorees, let me express my\nthanks to NYU. And congratulations from all of us to you, the Class of 2014, and to your\nfamilies, especially your parents. This is a special day to celebrate your achievements\nand to look forward to your lives ahead.\nYour NYU education has not only provided you with a foundation of knowledge;\nit has also, I hope, instilled in you a love of knowledge and an enduring curiosity. Life\nwill continue to be a journey of discovery if you tend the fires of curiosity that burn\nbrightly in all of us.\nSuch curiosity led Eric Kandel, here at NYU, to his lifetime goal, to discover the\nchemical and cellular basis of human memory. A few years after his graduation, he was\ndoing research on cats. But he had the idea of focusing on an animal with a simpler,\nmore fundamental brain: the California sea slug. His colleagues all but ridiculed him for\nthe idea. They “knew” that the study of the lowly sea slug was irrelevant for\nunderstanding human memory. Kandel’s surgically-skilled collaborator deserted him.\nTo get up to speed on sea slugs, he had to go abroad to study. But Kandel persisted and,\nin 2000, his curiosity won him the Nobel Prize. It was, as you must have guessed, for\ndeciphering the chemistry of memory in humans, as revealed by his research on sea slugs.\nKandel’s life, I believe, demonstrates how a persistent curiosity can help us reach\nambitious goals, even with great roadblocks in the way.\nA second tool for lifelong intellectual growth is a willingness to listen carefully to\nothers. These days, technology allows us access to a great breadth of perspectives, but it\nalso allows us to limit what voices we hear to the narrow range we find most agreeable.\nListening to others, especially those with whom we disagree, tests our own ideas and\n\n- 2 -\nbeliefs. It forces us to recognize, with humility, that we don’t have a monopoly on the\ntruth.\nYankee Stadium is a natural venue for another lesson: You won’t succeed all the\ntime. Even Ruth, Gehrig and DiMaggio failed most of the time when they stepped to the\nplate. Finding the right path in life, more often than not, involves some missteps. My\nFederal Reserve colleagues and I experienced this as we struggled to address a financial\nand economic crisis that threatened the global economy. We brainstormed and designed\na host of programs to unclog the plumbing of the financial system and to keep credit\nflowing. Not everything worked but we kept at it, and we remained focused on the task\nat hand. I learned the lesson during this period that one’s response to the inevitable\nsetbacks matters as much as the balance of victories and defeats.\nThere is an unfortunate myth that success is mainly determined by something\ncalled “ability.” But research indicates that our best measures of these qualities are\nunreliable predictors of performance in academics or employment. Psychologist Angela\nLee Duckworth says that what really matters is a quality she calls “grit”--an abiding\ncommitment to work hard toward long-range goals and to persevere through the setbacks\nthat come along the way.\nOne aspect of grit that I think is particularly important is the willingness to take a\nstand when circumstances demand it. Such circumstances may not be all that frequent,\nbut in every life, there will be crucial moments when having the courage to stand up for\nwhat you believe will be immensely important.\nMy predecessor at the Fed, Chairman Ben Bernanke, demonstrated such courage,\nespecially in his response to the threat of the financial crisis. To stabilize the financial\n\n- 3 -\nsystem and restore economic growth, he took courageous actions that were\nunprecedented in ambition and scope. He faced relentless criticism, personal threats, and\nthe certainty that history would judge him harshly if he was wrong. But he stood up for\nwhat he believed was right and necessary. Ben Bernanke’s intelligence and knowledge\nserved him well as Chairman. But his grit and willingness to take a stand were just as\nimportant. I hope you never are confronted by challenges this great, but you too will face\nmoments in life when standing up for what you believe can make all the difference.\nHaving dwelt for a moment on failure and grit, let me turn to the deeper meaning\nthat underpins grit and can carry us beyond failure. The hard work of building a life that\nmakes a difference is much easier to sustain when you are passionate about what you\npursue. When I first came to the Federal Reserve 37 years ago, I was struck by the\npassion of my colleagues for the mission of the Fed. And these many years later, each\nday at work, I see the importance of that passion to carrying out the Fed’s duties\neffectively. If there is a job that you feel passionate about, do what you can to pursue that\njob; if there is a purpose about which you are passionate, dedicate yourself to that\npurpose.\nFinally, I hope that you can find joy in the lives you choose. You are completing\none important phase of your life today and embarking on an amazing new adventure.\nSerious decisions about life surely lie ahead, but take the time to savor the joys, large and\nsmall that come along the way. Share those joys with others, and share a laugh when you\ncan.\n\n- 4 -\nIn closing, thank you again, on behalf of myself and the other honorees. Thank\nyou for the opportunity to speak to you today. Congratulations and good luck to the\nClass of 2014.",

    "text": "Speech at the Golden Gate University Speakers Series\nSan Francisco, California\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery July 31, 2006 – 8:45 AM Pacific Daylight Time, 11:45 AM Eastern\nProspects for the U.S. Economy\nThank you very much for inviting me to join you. It's a real pleasure to be part of\nthis outstanding speakers series. Today I will discuss my views on the prospects for the\nU.S. economy—for labor markets and economic activity and also for inflation. This focus\nmirrors the two main objectives for monetary policy enunciated in the Federal Reserve\nAct, namely maximum employment and price stability. I plan to explore the implications\nof these developments for monetary policy. Then, of course, I would welcome your\nquestions and comments. Before I begin, let me note that my remarks represent my own\nviews and are not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe U.S. economy has shown remarkable resilience in the face of some severe\nshocks—in particular, the surge in energy prices that began a couple of years ago and the\ndevastation from the twin hurricanes last summer. Over the past two years, economic\ngrowth has averaged just over 31/4 percent, moderately above current estimates of the\ngrowth rate that is sustainable in the long run. As a result, the economy now appears to\nhave moved within range of the full utilization of its resources—in other words, the slack\nin labor and product markets that was apparent a year ago has most likely been\neliminated. For example, over that time, both the rate of unused capacity in the industrial\nsector and the civilian unemployment rate have fallen noticeably.\nIndeed, the unemployment rate dropped by one full percentage point, coming in at\njust over 4½ percent in June. This rate is actually a bit lower than conventional estimates\n1\n\nof so-called \"full employment,\" and therefore suggests that there may be a bit of excess\ndemand in labor markets.\nHowever, the benchmark for these calculations—full employment or utilization—\ncannot be measured with a lot of precision, and may change over time. As a check on the\ndegree of utilization, I like to look at the behavior of labor compensation, including both\nwages and benefits. If, for example, labor markets were excessively tight, it seems likely\nthat we would see a pickup in the growth of labor compensation as firms competed for\nscarce workers. Instead, based on the most recent data, we find that broad measures of\ncompensation increased at a moderate rate over the past year. Nonetheless, tight labor\nmarkets could affect labor compensation with a lag, so it's possible that there is pressure\nfor acceleration in the pipeline. Moreover, these broad measures may have been held\ndown by a deceleration in benefits costs—for example, there has been a sharp slowdown\nin the growth of health insurance costs—which may have only a temporary effect on\noverall compensation. So, while moderate growth in compensation provides me with\nsome degree of comfort that we have not overshot full utilization, or, at least, not by very\nmuch, the jury is still out on this issue.\nWith labor and product markets close to full utilization, the key concern going\nforward is whether economic growth will slow enough and for long enough to avoid a\nbuildup of inflationary pressures. Recent data indicate that real GDP growth did slow\nnoticeably in the second quarter, coming in at 2½ percent. This is well below the rapid\n5½ rate in the first quarter, and moderately below most estimates of the rate that is\nsustainable in the long run.\n2\n\nMy best guess is that growth will still be healthy but will remain somewhat below\nthe sustainable rate as the year progresses. This outlook represents the net effect of a\nnumber of disparate forces. The impetus to keep the economy ticking along includes\nfactors such as ongoing strength in the fundamentals for productivity and relatively rapid\ngrowth in business investment in equipment and software—including the vital high-tech\nsector—as well as in spending on nonresidential structures.\nAs for the factors that are likely to restrain growth, there is the rise in both short-\nand long-term interest rates over the past couple of years as the Fed has removed\nmonetary policy accommodation. Since mid-2004 when the Fed began this process, most\nshort-term interest rates have increased between 3½ and 4 percentage points. Many long-\nterm rates are up by ¼ to ½ of a percentage point, with most of this increase occurring\nsince early this year. These higher rates should reduce demand, particularly in interest-\nsensitive sectors, notably, autos, consumer durables, and housing.\nIndeed, we have already seen some cooling in the housing sector, and this brings\nme to another factor that is likely to restrain growth—that is, the significant moderation\nin the rate of house-price appreciation. Slower increases in house prices could put a crimp\nin consumer spending in a couple of ways. First, some observers believe that consumers\nhave been keeping their spending up by withdrawing equity from the increased value of\ntheir homes; of course, this source of funds starts to shrink as the pace of appreciation\nslows. Furthermore, there may be some pullback by consumers due what is called the\nwealth effect—that is, slower house-price appreciation reduces growth in their wealth and\ntherefore their tendency to increase their spending.\n3\n\nWhile I expect the housing situation to have only moderating effects on economic\nactivity going forward, I should note that we can't ignore the risks of more unpleasant\nscenarios developing. One scenario that we have heard a lot about in recent years is the\npossibility that there is a house-price \"bubble,\" implying that prices got out of line with\nthe fundamental value of houses and that the current softening could be just the beginning\nof a more precipitous fall. While I seriously doubt that we'll see anything like a \"popping\nof the bubble\"—in part because I'm not convinced there is a bubble, at least on a national\nlevel—I certainly do acknowledge that there is more reason to worry that house prices\nwould fall sharply than that they would rise sharply.\nA second scenario has to do with the wealth effect I mentioned and its impact on\nhousehold saving behavior. In the U.S., the personal saving rate has been declining for\nyears, and in the second quarter it reached minus 1½ percent. Part of this development\nprobably relates to the growth in consumers' wealth in housing. As it has become easier\nand easier to tap into that wealth, people have felt less of a need to save from current\nincome. But with the softening in house prices acting to slow consumers' accumulation of\nwealth, the urge to save rather than spend may resurge. In fact, consumer wealth is\ngetting another hit from the recent declines in the stock market, which also may induce\npeople to build up savings. So, the very low—in fact, negative—saving rate makes the\nchance of a sizeable drop-off in consumer spending seem larger than the chance of a big\nsurge.\nSince housing is so important for the outlook, I'll spend a moment sketching in the\noverall picture for this sector. So far, the signs of cooling, including the deceleration in\nhouse-price appreciation, are broadly consistent with the degree of moderation I've\n4\n\nenvisioned, and fortunately these developments seem to be unfolding in an orderly way.\nAfter adjusting for inflation, residential investment has dropped by a total of 2 percent\nover the past three quarters. Housing permits are down from highs established earlier this\nyear. In addition, inventories of unsold houses are up significantly, sales of new and\nexisting homes are off their peaks, and surveys of home buyers and builders are showing\nmore pessimistic attitudes. Finally, after long being stagnant, rents are finally moving up\nmore vigorously. This may reflect, in part, expectations of lower house-price\nappreciation, as landlords raise rents to try to maintain the total rate of return on rental\nproperties and as those in the market for housing grow more inclined to rent than to buy.\nOf course, housing markets are a big issue in the Bay Area, and we have seen the\nsame kind of cooling as in the nation. The question of whether the housing stock here is\novervalued and therefore particularly vulnerable to downside risk, however, is one I can't\nanswer with any certainty. I would note that there are some special things about the Bay\nArea on both sides of the question. For example, consider some tentative evidence on the\nside of greater vulnerability. First, average house prices in the Bay Area are now about\nsix times what they were in 1982, versus only 3½ times in the U.S. as a whole. Moreover,\nthe ratio of house prices to rental rates—a measure of the price of houses relative to the\nflow of housing services they provide—has more than doubled since 1982, far out-\nstripping the national average. Even so, there are well-known and unique features of this\narea that lend some justification to its high housing values. First, there is not much land\navailable for new home building, so the supply of new homes is fairly limited. In\naddition, this area enjoys very favorable lifestyle amenities and it has a job base that\nattracts high-income residents.\n5\n\nIn closing my description of the forecast for economic activity, I have to mention\nthe big \"wild card\"—energy prices. And I'll return it to it when I discuss the inflation\noutlook. It is quite likely that rising energy prices have restrained consumer spending\nmoderately even though offsets from job gains and wealth have kept it rising overall. If\nenergy prices stabilize around their current levels, as futures markets indicate is expected,\nthen the negative effect of energy on spending should dissipate over 2007. While we all\ncertainly hope the energy futures markets are right, to be honest, their record hasn't been\nso great. During the whole period of rising energy prices that began in 2004, futures\nmarkets have usually predicted that the path of prices would be relatively flat, and they've\nhad to revise the path up as energy prices have continued to exceed expectations.\nBasically, over this period, energy markets have been marked by strong demand,\nincluding demand from emerging markets—notably China—and by reportedly limited\ncapacity to expand production. In addition, of course, there have been extraordinary\nevents that threaten to restrict supply and therefore jack up energy prices, like the current\nsituation in Lebanon and Israel. Needless to say, then, future energy prices are a big\nquestion mark, and any sustained rise or fall in these prices could either depress or spur\neconomic activity beyond my current expectations.\nInflation\nThis brings me to the inflation part of the picture. The recent news has been\ndisappointing. The measure of core consumer inflation that the FOMC projects for\nCongress—the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding the volatile\nfood and energy components—has risen rather sharply in recent months. It rose by nearly\n3 percent in the second quarter, which implies an increase over the past year of 2¼\n6\n\npercent. This rate is somewhat above my \"comfort zone\"—a range between one and two\npercent that I consider an appropriate long-run inflation objective for the Fed.\nTherefore, it is critical that core inflation trend in a downward direction over the\nmedium term, and I think this is the most likely outcome. As I've said, I expect that the\neconomy has entered a period of slightly below-trend growth that should relieve any\nunderlying inflationary pressures emanating from tightness in labor and product markets.\nIn addition, there are three other underlying factors that tend to bode well for future\ninflation. One I've already mentioned—labor compensation has been rising at a moderate\nrate. While there may be increases in the pipeline for the reasons I spelled out earlier, we\nhaven't seen convincing signs of them so far. Second, productivity growth has remained\nstrong, maintaining the pattern of strength established in the latter half of the 1990s.\nFinally, markups by businesses of product prices over costs are at historic highs. So, even\nif costs begin to rise, firms would have the room to absorb the increases without raising\ntheir prices.\nNext, there is the issue of the role of energy prices in the recent disappointing data\non core inflation. As I said, core inflation excludes energy prices. But there may have\nbeen some passthrough of higher energy prices into the prices of core goods that use\nenergy as an input to production—airfares are a good example. If this is the case, and if\nenergy prices level out as expected by futures markets, this pressure is likely to dissipate\nat some point. However, the whole question of passthrough is actually the subject of\nsome debate. For example, recent evidence suggests that there has been much less\npassthrough in the past twenty-five years than there was back in the 1970s, when\ninflation got out of control in the face of soaring energy prices. If it's true that there's only\n7\n\na very small passthrough of higher energy prices to inflation currently, then that raises the\nconcern that something more fundamental is pushing up inflation. Unfortunately, at this\npoint, it's too soon to untangle these alternative interpretations.\nFinally, inflation expectations must be considered in any discussion of inflation.\nNo matter what the cause of the recent increases in core inflation, it is important that they\ndo not get built into longer-term inflation expectations and, in turn, wages. Research\nsuggests that expectations have been well-anchored to price stability in recent years\nbecause people have confidence that the Fed will act to limit any sustained rise in\ninflation. This result shows up in the stability of survey and market measures of inflation\nexpectations in the face of the large energy price increases we've seen. But, I want to\nemphasize that this is not something that I—or my colleagues—take for granted.\nMaintaining credibility requires that we act when necessary to keep inflation under\ncontrol.\nI've explained why I think there are reasons to expect inflation to move gradually\nlower in the future. However, I am keenly aware that this pattern has yet to show up in\nthe data. And, given the inherent uncertainties, I would say that there are currently upside\nrisks to this inflation forecast.\nPolicy issues\nThis leads me to the concluding topic in my presentation today—the implications\nof recent economic developments for monetary policy. With inflation now too high and\nlabor and product markets in the vicinity of full utilization—or perhaps even a bit beyond\nit—a period of growth modestly below trend would ease any cyclical pressures on core\n8\n\ninflation and, given the other elements in the inflation outlook that I just discussed, would\nbe likely to set the stage for a gradual decline back into my comfort zone.\nIn these circumstances, it might be thought that policy should continue to tighten\nuntil the inflation data move back to a rate consistent with price stability. But I would\nargue that a gradual approach is likely to be better. Let me illustrate this point with a\nmedical analogy. Suppose you go to the doctor for your annual physical and she finds\nyou have high blood pressure—say, 150 over 100. The doctor prescribes medication to\nget it down toward 120 over 80. She tells you that the evidence indicates that it takes a\nwhile for the medication to work, so you should take one pill a day for a week and then\nretest your blood pressure. You take the pill the first day. On the second day, you're\nworried and nervous—elevated blood pressure is no laughing matter—and you can't\nresist taking another reading. When you do, you find that your pressure is still up there.\nYou are so worried about the ill effects of your condition that you figure that it's okay to\ntake two pills instead of the one the doctor prescribed. You repeat this pattern on the third\nday, as well, upping the dosage to three pills. This approach almost certainly will reduce\nyour blood pressure. But by not properly considering the lags between the time you take\nthe medicine and the time it takes effect, you could end up with blood pressure that's too\nlow, and that could well present its own health hazards.\nThe need to incorporate lags between policy actions and effects on the economy is\na key issue for monetary policy as well. We don't know what the lags are with precision,\nbut we still need to do the best we can to take them into account. We simply don't get the\nnecessary feedback on the effects of our policy actions for a long time. So if we kept\n9\n\nautomatically raising rates until we saw inflation start to respond, we most likely would\nhave gone too far. Instead we need to be forward-looking.\nThat is why I've focused today on the economic outlook, and particularly on those\naspects of the outlook that pertain to the dual mandate the Congress has given the Fed.\nWe are charged with achieving both price stability and maximum sustainable\nemployment. So, for all of these reasons, it makes sense for us to target a forecast for\ninflation, output, and employment—in other words, to set the funds rate at a level that is\nlikely to foster a desirable path for the economy.\nHowever, forecasts are uncertain and depend heavily on the particular view of the\nworld—or model—that is being used. That's why I also like to use other methods to\nobtain benchmarks for the thrust of our policies in the future. One alternative approach is\nto estimate the so-called neutral federal funds rate, which is defined as the rate—or policy\nsetting—that would be consistent in the intermediate run with stable inflation and full\nemployment. If we could determine what the neutral rate is, we could set the actual rate\nappropriately. For example, in the present circumstances, I would consider it appropriate\nfor the actual rate to be a bit above the neutral rate—in other words, I'd like it to be\nmodestly restrictive—to promote price stability, especially given that the economy may\nbe operating with labor and product markets that are a bit on the tight side. Estimates of\nthe neutral rate can be based on a variety of large and small models and on statistical\ntechniques. Of course, we can't get precise estimates, only an indication that can be\nhelpful along with other benchmarks.\nAnother approach involves monetary policy rules—such as the so-called Taylor\nrule—that can be consulted for appropriate policy settings. These rules incorporate\n10\n\nestimates of the neutral federal funds rate as a benchmark. They then prescribe how the\nactual funds rate should stand relative to the neutral rate depending on how inflation and\nresource utilization stand relative to our dual mandates—price stability and full\nutilization. So, for example, if inflation is above a particular definition of price stability,\nthe rules will say that the funds rate should be above the neutral rate. These rules have\nbeen shown to broadly characterize actual Fed monetary policies that have been\nsuccessful in the past.\nConsulting all of these approaches, it appears to me that the federal funds rate\ncurrently lies in a vicinity that is roughly appropriate for the Fed to attain its key\nobjectives over the medium run. However, since all such approaches are inherently\nimprecise, policy must be responsive to the data that actually emerges. When I say that\npolicy should be responsive to the data, I mean that the extent and timing of any\nadditional firming should depend on how emerging developments affect the economic\noutlook. And when I say data, I don't just mean data on inflation, output, and\nemployment. I also mean data on factors that might affect those variables in the future—\nsuch as energy prices, the dollar, the stock market, long-term interest rates, housing\nprices and inflation expectations.\nI believe that the wording of the policy statement the FOMC issued at the end of\nJune—following our last meeting—succinctly captures the essence of the basic point I'm\nmaking: it states that \"Although the moderation in the growth of aggregate demand\nshould help to limit inflation pressures over time, the Committee judges that some\ninflation risks remain. The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be\n11\n\nneeded to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both\ninflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.\"\nThank you for having me today, and I will be pleased to address your questions.\n# # #\n12",

Data collection began December\n22, 2011, and was concluded on January 9, 2012. Nearly 2,300 respondents completed the survey.\nOne out of five American consumers used their mobile phone to access their bank account, credit card, or\nother financial account in the 12 months ending in January 2012 and an additional one out of five\nindicated they would likely use mobile banking at some point in the future, according to the survey.\nThe survey's findings suggest that the use of mobile banking is poised to expand further over the next\nyear, with usage possibly increasing to one out of three mobile phone users by 2013. However, the\nsurvey indicates that many consumers remain skeptical of the benefit of mobile banking and the level of\nsecurity associated with the technology.\nThe use of mobile banking is highly correlated with age, according to the survey results. People between\n18 and 29 account for approximately 44 percent of mobile banking users, relative to 22 percent of all\nmobile phone users. Conversely, people age 60 and over account for only 6 percent of all mobile banking\nusers, but 24 percent of mobile phone users. The survey showed a significantly higher level of mobile\nbanking uptake among African Americans (16 percent) and Hispanics (17 percent), relative to 11 percent\nand 13 percent of mobile phone users, respectively.\nThe widespread use of mobile technology has the potential to expand access to financial services for\npreviously underserved populations. Underbanked individuals (people with bank accounts but who use\ncheck cashers, payday lenders, or payroll cards) make relatively heavy use of mobile banking, according\nto the survey. Of this group, 29 percent used mobile banking in the year ending in January 2012.\nThe survey found that the most common mobile banking activities are consumers checking their account\nbalances or monitoring recent transactions. Less frequently used mobile banking functions include\nmaking online bill payments from a bank account, locating an in-network automated teller machine, and\ndepositing a check by phone.\nThe majority of consumers who have a mobile phone but do not use mobile banking said they either had\nno need for these services or expressed security concerns. When asked to rate the security of mobile\nbanking, non-users were more likely to report that they believed it was unsecure or that they simply didn't\nknow how secure the technology was.\n\nAdditional Information\nAll circulars and documents are available on the Internet through the Federal Reserve Bank of San\nFrancisco’s website, at http://www.frbsf.org/banking/letters.\nFor additional information, please contact:\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nBanking Supervision and Regulation\n(415) 974-2923\nAttachment: Federal Reserve Board survey (2.5 MB PDF).",

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Designing Resilient Monetary Policy Frameworks for the Future”\na symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\nJackson Hole, Wyoming\nAugust 26, 2016\n\nThe Global Financial Crisis and Great Recession posed daunting new challenges\nfor central banks around the world and spurred innovations in the design,\nimplementation, and communication of monetary policy. With the U.S. economy now\nnearing the Federal Reserve’s statutory goals of maximum employment and price\nstability, this conference provides a timely opportunity to consider how the lessons we\nlearned are likely to influence the conduct of monetary policy in the future.\nThe theme of the conference, “Designing Resilient Monetary Policy Frameworks\nfor the Future,” encompasses many aspects of monetary policy, from the nitty-gritty\ndetails of implementing policy in financial markets to broader questions about how policy\naffects the economy. Within the operational realm, key choices include the selection of\npolicy instruments, the specific markets in which the central bank participates, and the\nsize and structure of the central bank’s balance sheet. These topics are of great\nimportance to the Federal Reserve. As noted in the minutes of last month’s Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC) meeting, we are studying many issues related to policy\nimplementation, research which ultimately will inform the FOMC’s views on how to\nmost effectively conduct monetary policy in the years ahead. I expect that the work\ndiscussed at this conference will make valuable contributions to the understanding of\nmany of these important issues.\nMy focus today will be the policy tools that are needed to ensure that we have a\nresilient monetary policy framework. In particular, I will focus on whether our existing\ntools are adequate to respond to future economic downturns. As I will argue, one lesson\nfrom the crisis is that our pre-crisis toolkit was inadequate to address the range of\neconomic circumstances that we faced. Looking ahead, we will likely need to retain\n\n- 2 -\nmany of the monetary policy tools that were developed to promote recovery from the\ncrisis. In addition, policymakers inside and outside the Fed may wish at some point to\nconsider additional options to secure a strong and resilient economy. But before I turn to\nthese longer-run issues, I would like to offer a few remarks on the near-term outlook for\nthe U.S. economy and the potential implications for monetary policy.\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook\nU.S. economic activity continues to expand, led by solid growth in household\nspending. But business investment remains soft and subdued foreign demand and the\nappreciation of the dollar since mid-2014 continue to restrain exports. While economic\ngrowth has not been rapid, it has been sufficient to generate further improvement in the\nlabor market. Smoothing through the monthly ups and downs, job gains averaged\n190,000 per month over the past three months. Although the unemployment rate has\nremained fairly steady this year, near 5 percent, broader measures of labor utilization\nhave improved. Inflation has continued to run below the FOMC’s objective of 2 percent,\nreflecting in part the transitory effects of earlier declines in energy and import prices.\nLooking ahead, the FOMC expects moderate growth in real gross domestic\nproduct (GDP), additional strengthening in the labor market, and inflation rising to\n2 percent over the next few years. Based on this economic outlook, the FOMC continues\nto anticipate that gradual increases in the federal funds rate will be appropriate over time\nto achieve and sustain employment and inflation near our statutory objectives. Indeed, in\nlight of the continued solid performance of the labor market and our outlook for\neconomic activity and inflation, I believe the case for an increase in the federal funds rate\n\n- 3 -\nhas strengthened in recent months. Of course, our decisions always depend on the degree\nto which incoming data continues to confirm the Committee’s outlook.\nAnd, as ever, the economic outlook is uncertain, and so monetary policy is not on\na preset course. Our ability to predict how the federal funds rate will evolve over time is\nquite limited because monetary policy will need to respond to whatever disturbances may\nbuffet the economy. In addition, the level of short-term interest rates consistent with the\ndual mandate varies over time in response to shifts in underlying economic conditions\nthat are often evident only in hindsight. For these reasons, the range of reasonably likely\noutcomes for the federal funds rate is quite wide--a point illustrated by figure 1 in your\nhandout. The line in the center is the median path for the federal funds rate based on the\nFOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections in June.1 The shaded region, which is based\non the historical accuracy of private and government forecasters, shows a 70 percent\nprobability that the federal funds rate will be between 0 and 3-1/4 percent at the end of\nnext year and between 0 and 4-1/2 percent at the end of 2018. 2 The reason for the wide\nrange is that the economy is frequently buffeted by shocks and thus rarely evolves as\npredicted. When shocks occur and the economic outlook changes, monetary policy needs\n1 The June 2016 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) is an addendum to the minutes of the June 2016\nFOMC meeting and is available on the Board’s website at\nwww.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20160615.pdf.\n2 The confidence interval equals (subject to a lower bound of 12.5 basis points) the median SEP path for the\nfederal funds rate plus or minus average root mean squared prediction errors (RMSPEs) of the three-month\nTreasury bill rate, for horizons from zero to nine quarters ahead, based on forecast errors made over the\npast 20 years. Average RMSPEs are calculated as the mean of the RMSPEs of the following forecasters,\nsubject to availability for the horizon in question: the Federal Reserve Board staff (Greenbook/Tealbook),\nthe Administration, the Congressional Budget Office, the Blue Chip consensus forecast, and the Survey of\nProfessional Forecasters. Differences in predictive accuracy among these forecasters are not statistically\nsignificant. For more information on the general methodology used to construct confidence intervals using\nhistorical forecasting errors, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip (2007), “Gauging the Uncertainty of\nthe Economic Outlook from Historical Forecasting Errors,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series\n2007-60 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, November),\nwww.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2007/200760/200760pap.pdf.\n\n- 4 -\nto adjust. What we do know, however, is that we want a policy toolkit that will allow us\nto respond to a wide range of possible conditions.\nThe Pre-Crisis Toolkit\nPrior to the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy toolkit was\nsimple but effective in the circumstances that then prevailed. Our main tool consisted of\nopen market operations to manage the amount of reserve balances available to the\nbanking sector.3 These operations, in turn, influenced the interest rate in the federal\nfunds market, where banks experiencing reserve shortfalls could borrow from banks with\nexcess reserves. Before the onset of the crisis, the volume of reserves was generally\nsmall--only about $45 billion or so.4 Thus, even small open market operations could\nhave a significant effect on the federal funds rate. Changes in the federal funds rate\nwould then be transmitted to other short-term interest rates, affecting longer-term interest\nrates and overall financial conditions and hence inflation and economic activity. This\nsimple, light-touch system allowed the Federal Reserve to operate with a relatively small\nbalance sheet--less than $1 trillion before the crisis--the size of which was largely\ndetermined by the need to supply enough U.S. currency to meet demand.5\nThe global financial crisis revealed two main shortcomings of this simple toolkit.\nThe first was an inability to control the federal funds rate once reserves were no longer\n3 Open market operations at the time were primarily repurchase agreements based on Treasury securities,\nwith primary dealers as counterparties.\n4 Reserves of depository institutions include vault cash and balances maintained with Federal Reserve\nBanks. Excess reserves are the reserves held over and above required reserves. See the Board’s webpage\n“Reserve Requirements” at www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reservereq.htm.\n5 Prior to the financial crisis, the size of the Fed’s balance sheet was about $900 billion. Assets consisted\nalmost entirely of Treasury securities. Liabilities included currency held by the public and a relatively\nsmall volume of reserve balances. For more on the Fed’s balance sheet, see\nwww.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_fedsbalancesheet.htm.\n\n- 5 -\nrelatively scarce. Starting in late 2007, faced with acute financial market distress, the\nFederal Reserve created programs to keep credit flowing to households and businesses.6\nThe loans extended under those programs helped stabilize the financial system. But the\nadditional reserves created by these programs, if left unchecked, would have pushed\ndown the federal funds rate, driving it well below the FOMC’s target. To prevent such an\noutcome, the Federal Reserve took several steps to offset (or sterilize) the effect of its\nliquidity and credit operations on reserves.7 By the fall of 2008, however, the reserve\neffects of our liquidity and credit programs threatened to become too large to sterilize via\nasset sales and other existing tools. Without sufficient sterilization capacity, the quantity\nof reserves increased to a point that the Federal Reserve had difficulty maintaining\neffective control over the federal funds rate.\nOf course, by the end of 2008, stabilizing the federal funds rate at a level\nmaterially above zero was not an immediate concern because the economy clearly needed\nvery low short-term interest rates. Faced with a steep rise in unemployment and\ndeclining inflation, the FOMC lowered its target for the federal funds rate to near zero, a\nreduction of roughly 5 percentage points over the previous year and a half. Nonetheless,\na variety of policy benchmarks would, at least in hindsight, have called for pushing the\n6 For information on the Federal Reserve’s credit and liquidity programs that were implemented in response\nto the financial crisis, see www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_crisisresponse.htm on the Board’s\nwebsite.\n7 Reserves were initially taken out of the banking system by not reinvesting principal payments from\nmaturing securities and later by selling portions of securities holdings. In September 2008, the Department\nof the Treasury announced the temporary Supplementary Financing Program, in which the proceeds of a\nseries of Treasury bill auctions, separate from Treasury’s routine borrowing, were maintained in an account\nat the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The funds in this account served to drain reserves from the\nbanking system.\n\n- 6 -\nfederal funds rate well below zero during the economic downturn.8 That doing so was\nimpossible highlights the second serious limitation of our pre-crisis policy toolkit: its\ninability to generate substantially more accommodation than could be provided by a near-\nzero federal funds rate.\nOur Expanded Toolkit\nTo address the challenges posed by the financial crisis and the subsequent severe\nrecession and slow recovery, the Federal Reserve significantly expanded its monetary\npolicy toolkit. In 2006, the Congress had approved plans to allow the Fed, beginning in\n2011, to pay interest on banks’ reserve balances.9 In the fall of 2008, the Congress\nmoved up the effective date of this authority to October 2008. That authority was\nessential. Paying interest on reserve balances enables the Fed to break the strong link\nbetween the quantity of reserves and the level of the federal funds rate and, in turn,\nallows the Federal Reserve to control short-term interest rates when reserves are plentiful.\nIn particular, once economic conditions warrant a higher level for market interest rates,\nthe Federal Reserve could raise the interest rate paid on excess reserves--the IOER rate.\n8 Consider the following policy rule: R(t) = R* + π(t) + 0.5[π(t)-π*]-2.0[U(t)-U*], where R is the federal\nfunds rate, R* is the longer-run normal value of the federal funds rate adjusted for inflation, π is the four-\nquarter moving average of core PCE inflation, π* is the FOMC’s target for inflation (2 percent), U is the\nunemployment rate, and U* is the longer-run normal rate of unemployment. Based on the medians of\nFOMC participants’ latest longer-run projections, R* is approximately 1 percent and U* is about\n4.8 percent. Accordingly, with the unemployment rate climbing to 10 percent and core PCE inflation\nfalling to 1 percent in 2009, this rule would have prescribed lowering the federal funds rate to minus\n9 percent at the depths of the recession. In contrast, the standard Taylor rule, which is half as responsive to\nmovements in resource utilization, would have prescribed lowering the federal funds rate to minus\n3-3/4 percent using the same estimates for R* and U*. The more aggressive rule does a reasonably good\njob of accounting for movements in the federal funds rate in the decade prior to its falling to its effective\nlower bound in late 2008, see David Reifschneider (2016), “Gauging the Ability of the FOMC to Respond\nto Future Recessions,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2016-068 (Washington: Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System, August),\nwww.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2016/files/2016068pap.pdf. For more information on the\nstandard Taylor rule, see John B. Taylor (1993), “Discretion versus Policy Rules in Practice,” Carnegie-\nRochester Conference Series on Public Policy, vol. 39 (December), pp. 195-214.\n9 Paying interest on reserves is a tool commonly used by central banks, including the Bank of England, the\nBank of Japan, and the European Central Bank.\n\n- 7 -\nA higher IOER rate encourages banks to raise the interest rates they charge, putting\nupward pressure on market interest rates regardless of the level of reserves in the banking\nsector.\nWhile adjusting the IOER rate is an effective way to move market interest rates\nwhen reserves are plentiful, federal funds have generally traded below this rate. This\nrelative softness of the federal funds rate reflects, in part, the fact that only depository\ninstitutions can earn the IOER rate. To put a more effective floor under short-term\ninterest rates, the Federal Reserve created supplementary tools to be used as needed. For\ninstance, the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility is available to a\nvariety of counterparties, including eligible money market funds, government-sponsored\nenterprises, broker-dealers, and depository institutions. Through it, eligible\ncounterparties may invest funds overnight with the Federal Reserve at a rate determined\nby the FOMC. Similar to the payment of IOER, the ON RRP facility discourages\nparticipating institutions from lending at a rate substantially below that offered by the\nFed.10\nOur current toolkit proved effective last December. In an environment of\nsuperabundant reserves, the FOMC raised the effective federal funds rate--that is, the\nweighted average rate on federal funds transactions among participants in that market--by\nthe desired amount, and we have since maintained the federal funds rate in its target\nrange.\n10 Other tools that could help strengthen the floor under short-term interest rates but are not currently in use\ninclude the Term Deposit Facility and term reverse repurchase agreements.\n\n- 8 -\nTwo other major additions to the Fed’s toolkit were large-scale asset purchases\nand increasingly explicit forward guidance.11 Both were used to provide additional\nmonetary policy accommodation after short-term interest rates fell close to zero. Our\npurchases of Treasury and mortgage-related securities in the open market pushed down\nlonger-term borrowing rates for millions of American families and businesses. Extended\nforward rate guidance--announcing that we intended to keep short-term interest rates\nlower for longer than might have otherwise been expected--also put significant\ndownward pressure on longer-term borrowing rates, as did guidance regarding the size\nand scope of our asset purchases.\nIn light of the slowness of the economic recovery, some have questioned the\neffectiveness of asset purchases and extended forward rate guidance. But this criticism\nfails to consider the unusual headwinds the economy faced after the crisis. Those\nheadwinds included substantial household and business deleveraging, unfavorable\ndemand shocks from abroad, a period of contractionary fiscal policy, and unusually tight\ncredit, especially for housing. Studies have found that our asset purchases and extended\nforward rate guidance put appreciable downward pressure on long-term interest rates and,\nas a result, helped spur growth in demand for goods and services, lower the\nunemployment rate, and prevent inflation from falling further below our 2 percent\nobjective.12\n11 Prior to the crisis, the Fed occasionally used forward guidance pertaining to the likely future path of\ninterest rates, but that guidance was usually confined to a relatively short time frame.\n12 See, for instance, Joseph Gagnon, Matthew Raskin, Julie Remache, and Brian Sack (2011), “The\nFinancial Market Effects of the Federal Reserve’s Large-Scale Asset Purchases,” International Journal of\nCentral Banking, vol. 7 (March), pp. 3-43, www.ijcb.org/journal/ijcb11q1a1.htm; and Stefania D’Amico,\nWilliam English, David López-Salido, and Edward Nelson (2012), “The Federal Reserve’s Large-Scale\nAsset Purchase Programmes: Rationale and Effects,” Economic Journal, vol. 122 (November), pp. F415-\n46. Moreover, the Federal Reserve’s forward guidance and asset purchase policies have been estimated to\n\n- 9 -\nTwo of the Fed’s most important new tools--our authority to pay interest on\nexcess reserves and our asset purchases--interacted importantly. Without IOER\nauthority, the Federal Reserve would have been reluctant to buy as many assets as it did\nbecause of the longer-run implications for controlling the stance of monetary policy.\nWhile we were buying assets aggressively to help bring the U.S. economy out of a severe\nrecession, we also had to keep in mind whether and how we would be able to remove\nmonetary policy accommodation when appropriate. That issue was particularly relevant\nbecause we fund our asset purchases through the creation of reserves, and those\nadditional reserves would have made it ever more difficult for the pre-crisis toolkit to\nraise short-term interest rates when needed.\nThe FOMC considered removing accommodation by first reducing our asset\nholdings (including through asset sales) and raising the federal funds rate only after our\nbalance sheet had contracted substantially. But we decided against this approach because\nour ability to predict the effects of changes in the balance sheet on the economy is less\nthan that associated with changes in the federal funds rate. Excessive inflationary\npressures could arise if assets were sold too slowly. Conversely, financial markets and\nthe economy could potentially be destabilized if assets were sold too aggressively.\nIndeed, the so-called taper tantrum of 2013 illustrates the difficulty of predicting financial\nmarket reactions to announcements about the balance sheet. Given the uncertainty and\npotential costs associated with large-scale asset sales, the FOMC instead decided to begin\nhave helped lower unemployment and boost inflation; see Eric M. Engen, Thomas Laubach, and David\nReifschneider (2015), “The Macroeconomic Effects of the Federal Reserve’s Unconventional Monetary\nPolicies,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2015-005 (Washington: Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System, January), http://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2015.005.\n\n- 10 -\nremoving monetary policy accommodation primarily by adjusting short-term interest\nrates rather than by actively managing its asset holdings.13 That strategy--raising short-\nterm interest rates once the recovery was sufficiently advanced while maintaining a\nrelatively large balance sheet and plentiful bank reserves--depended on our ability to pay\ninterest on excess reserves.\nWhere Do We Go from Here?\nWhat does the future hold for the Fed’s toolkit? For starters, our ability to use\ninterest on reserves is likely to play a key role for years to come. In part, this reflects the\noutlook for our balance sheet over the next few years. As the FOMC has noted in its\nrecent statements, at some point after the process of raising the federal funds rate is well\nunder way, we will cease or phase out reinvesting repayments of principal from our\nsecurities holdings. Once we stop reinvestment, it should take several years for our asset\nholdings--and the bank reserves used to finance them--to passively decline to a more\nnormal level. But even after the volume of reserves falls substantially, IOER will still be\nimportant as a contingency tool, because we may need to purchase assets during future\nrecessions to supplement conventional interest rate reductions.14 Forecasts now show the\n13 The FOMC’s “Policy Normalization Principles and Plans” call for reducing the Federal Reserve’s\nsecurities holdings in a “gradual and predictable manner primarily by ceasing to reinvest repayments of\nprincipal on securities held in the [System Open Market Account]” (Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System (2014), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement on Policy Normalization Principles and\nPlans,” press release, September 17, second bullet,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140917c.htm). Consistent with those plans, the\nFederal Open Market Committee anticipates that it will maintain its current reinvestment strategy “until\nnormalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way” (for instance, see Board of Governors\nof the Federal Reserve System (2015), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,” press release,\nDecember 16, paragraph 5, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20151216a.htm.\n14 If the FOMC were to again increase the size of the balance sheet markedly in response to a future\nrecession, then the ability to pay interest on reserves could be critical during the subsequent recovery period\nto help control short-term interest rates while the balance sheet remains elevated. Beyond this motivation\nfor retaining IOER, the ability to pay interest on reserves could also be important to the operation of any\nspecial liquidity and credit facilities that might be created to deal with systemic disruptions to the financial\n\n- 11 -\nfederal funds rate settling at about 3 percent in the longer run.15 In contrast, the federal\nfunds rate averaged more than 7 percent between 1965 and 2000. Thus, we expect to\nhave less scope for interest rate cuts than we have had historically.\nIn part, current expectations for a low future federal funds rate reflect the\nFOMC’s success in stabilizing inflation at around 2 percent--a rate much lower than rates\nthat prevailed during the 1970s and 1980s. Another key factor is the marked decline over\nthe past decade, both here and abroad, in the long-run neutral real rate of interest--that is,\nthe inflation-adjusted short-term interest rate consistent with keeping output at its\npotential on average over time.16 Several developments could have contributed to this\napparent decline, including slower growth in the working-age populations of many\ncountries, smaller productivity gains in the advanced economies, a decreased propensity\nto spend in the wake of the financial crises around the world since the late 1990s, and\nsystem during a future emergency. In particular, such facilities could significantly expand the supply of\nreserves, which would be problematic if the FOMC wished to keep short-term interest rates from falling to\nzero.\n15 In the Blue Chip Financial Indicators survey released on June 1, 2016, the consensus forecast for the\nlonger-run level of the federal funds rate was 3.2 percent. FOMC participants in June 2016 generally\nanticipated a slightly lower longer-run level, in that the median of their individual forecasts was 3 percent\n(see table 1 of the June 2016 SEP, available at\nwww.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20160615ep.htm). The latest long-run forecast from\nthe Administration (www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2016/assets/16msr.pdf) is also\nclose to 3 percent, as was the projection made by the Congressional Budget Office earlier in the year (see\nwww.cbo.gov/about/products/budget_economic_data).\n16 Updated estimates from the model developed by Laubach and Williams (2003) indicate that the real\nlong-run neutral or “equilibrium” short-term interest rate in the United States is currently about\n2-1/2 percentage points lower than it was on average in the 1980s and 1990s (see Thomas Laubach and\nJohn C. Williams (2003), “Measuring the Natural Rate of Interest,” Review of Economics and Statistics,\nvol. 85 (November), pp. 1063-70; updated estimates are available at www.frbsf.org/economic-\nresearch/economists/john-williams/Laubach_Williams_updated_estimates.xlsx.) In addition, Holston,\nLaubach, and Williams (2016) find significant but somewhat smaller declines in equilibrium rates for the\neuro area, Canada, and the United Kingdom (see Kathryn Holston, Thomas Laubach, and John C. Williams\n(2016), “Measuring the Natural Rate of Interest: International Trends and Determinants,” Working Paper\n2016-11 (San Francisco: Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, June), www.frbsf.org/economic-\nresearch/files/wp2016-11.pdf).\n\n- 12 -\nperhaps a paucity of attractive capital projects worldwide.17 Although these factors may\nhelp explain why bond yields have fallen to such low levels here and abroad, our\nunderstanding of the forces driving long-run trends in interest rates is nevertheless\nlimited, and thus all predictions in this area are highly uncertain.18\nWould an average federal funds rate of about 3 percent impair the Fed’s ability to\nfight recessions? Based on the FOMC’s behavior in past recessions, one might think that\nsuch a low interest rate could substantially impair policy effectiveness. As shown in the\nfirst column of the table in the handout, during the past nine recessions, the FOMC cut\nthe federal funds rate by amounts ranging from about 3 percentage points to more than\n10 percentage points. On average, the FOMC reduced rates by about 5-1/2 percentage\npoints, which seems to suggest that the FOMC would face a shortfall of about\n2-1/2 percentage points for dealing with an average-sized recession. But this simple\ncomparison exaggerates the limitations on policy created by the zero lower bound. As\nshown in the second column, the federal funds rate at the start of the past seven\nrecessions was appreciably above the level consistent with the economy operating at\npotential in the longer run. In most cases, this tighter-than-normal stance of policy before\n17 For a discussion of the possible role played by these factors in explaining the current low level of interest\nrates in the United States and other advanced economies, see Lawrence H.

As a result, a large portion of the rate\ncuts that subsequently occurred during these recessions represented the undoing of the\nearlier tight stance of monetary policy. Of course, this situation could occur again in the\nfuture. But if it did, the federal funds rate at the onset of the recession would be well\nabove its normal level, and the FOMC would be able to cut short-term interest rates by\nsubstantially more than 3 percentage points.\nA recent paper takes a different approach to assessing the FOMC’s ability to\nrespond to future recessions by using simulations of the FRB/US model.19 This analysis\nbegins by asking how the economy would respond to a set of highly adverse shocks if\npolicymakers followed a fairly aggressive policy rule, hypothetically assuming that they\ncan cut the federal funds rate without limit.20 It then imposes the zero lower bound and\nasks whether some combination of forward guidance and asset purchases would be\nsufficient to generate economic conditions at least as good as those that occur under the\n19 FRB/US model simulations have several advantages for analyzing this issue. For one, the model’s\nstructure allows the public’s expectations for interest rates, inflation, and other factors to take full account\nof the implications of the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates, changes in future monetary\npolicy as signaled by forward guidance, and asset purchases. In addition, the model incorporates the low\nresponsiveness of inflation to movements in resource utilization seen in recent years as well as the effects\nof asset purchases on term premiums, and thus a variety of longer-term interest rates, equity prices, and the\nforeign exchange value of the dollar. For a further discussion about the advantages (and possible\ndisadvantages) of using the FRB/US model to study this issue, see Reifschneider, “Gauging the Ability of\nthe FOMC to Respond to Future Recessions,“ in note 8.\n20 The aggressive rule is R(t) = 1.0 + π(t) + 0.5 [π(t)-2] - 2.0 [U(t) - 4.8], where R is the federal funds rate,\nπ is the four-quarter moving average of core PCE inflation, and U is the unemployment rate [Note: On\nAugust 30, 2016, a typo in the equation for the aggressive rule was corrected to change “[4.8 - U(t)]” to\n“[U(t) - 4.8]”]. Note that baseline values of the equilibrium real rate, the natural rate of unemployment, and\nthe target rate of inflation used in the simulation analysis--1.0 percent, 4.8 percent, and 2.0 percent,\nrespectively--are consistent with the medians of the latest long-run projections of individual FOMC\nparticipants. As discussed by Taylor (1999), this rule appears to do a good job in stabilizing real activity\nand inflation in a wide range of economic models (see John B. Taylor (1999), “Introduction,” in John B.\nTaylor, ed., Monetary Policy Rules (Chicago: University of Chicago Press), pp. 1-14).\n\n- 14 -\nhypothetical unconstrained policy. In general, the study concludes that, even if the\naverage level of the federal funds rate in the future is only 3 percent, these new tools\nshould be sufficient unless the recession were to be unusually severe and persistent.\nFigure 2 in your handout illustrates this point. It shows simulated paths for\ninterest rates, the unemployment rate, and inflation under three different monetary policy\nresponses--the aggressive rule in the absence of the zero lower bound constraint, the\nconstrained aggressive rule, and the constrained aggressive rule combined with $2 trillion\nin asset purchases and guidance that the federal funds rate will depart from the rule by\nstaying lower for longer.21 As the red dashed line shows, the federal funds rate would fall\nfar below zero if policy were unconstrained, thereby causing long-term interest rates to\nfall sharply.i But despite the lower bound, asset purchases and forward guidance can\npush long-term interest rates even lower on average than in the unconstrained case\n(especially when adjusted for inflation) by reducing term premiums and increasing the\ndownward pressure on the expected average value of future short-term interest rates.\nThus, the use of such tools could result in even better outcomes for unemployment and\ninflation on average.\nOf course, this analysis could be too optimistic. For one, the FRB/US simulations\nmay overstate the effectiveness of forward guidance and asset purchases, particularly in\nan environment where long-term interest rates are also likely to be unusually low.22 In\n21 The forward guidance is provided at the start of the recession and has three components. First, the\nfederal funds rate will be lowered to zero more quickly than prescribed by the rule. Second, the federal\nfunds rate will remain at zero as long as the unemployment rate is greater than 5 percent. And, finally, that\nafter the initial increase in the federal funds rate, policymakers will proceed gradually in returning to the\nprescriptions of the policy rule.\n22 As shown in figure 2, the 10-year Treasury yield in the simulation starts out at just over 4 percent, well\nbelow its level pre-crisis, suggesting that there may be less room to push down long-term interest rates in\nthe future than in the past. Another potential source of overstatement could be the FRB/US assumption that\n\n- 15 -\naddition, policymakers could have less ability to cut short-term interest rates in the future\nthan the simulations assume. By some calculations, the real neutral rate is currently close\nto zero, and it could remain at this low level if we were to continue to see slow\nproductivity growth and high global saving.23 If so, then the average level of the nominal\nfederal funds rate down the road might turn out to be only 2 percent, implying that asset\npurchases and forward guidance might have to be pushed to extremes to compensate.24\nMoreover, relying too heavily on these nontraditional tools could have unintended\nconsequences. For example, if future policymakers responded to a severe recession by\nannouncing their intention to keep the federal funds rate near zero for a very long time\nafter the economy had substantially recovered and followed through on that guidance,\nthen they might inadvertently encourage excessive risk-taking and so undermine financial\nstability.\nFinally, the simulation analysis certainly overstates the FOMC’s current ability to\nrespond to a recession, given that there is little scope to cut the federal funds rate at the\nchanges in long-term interest rates, whether driven by shifts in term premiums or shifts in the expected path\nof short-term interest rates, have the same influence on real activity, as there is some empirical evidence\nthat the estimated sensitivity of spending to movements in term premiums alone may be relatively small;\nsee Michael T. Kiley (2014), “The Aggregate Demand Effects of Short- and Long-Term Interest Rates,”\nInternational Journal of Central Banking, vol. 10 (December), pp. 69-104,\nwww.ijcb.org/journal/ijcb14q4a3.pdf. On the other hand, the effectiveness of forward guidance in the\nFRB/US model is materially less than it is in some other models, implying that the FRB/US simulation\nresults could potentially understate the stimulus provided by the announcement of a lower-for-longer\npolicy. See Hess Chung (2015), “The Effects of Forward Guidance in Three Macro Models,” FEDS Notes\n(Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February 26),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/notes/feds-notes/2015/effects-of-forward-guidance-in-three-\nmacro-models-20150226.html.\n23 In principle, the federal funds rate in the longer run could also turn out to be lower than currently\npredicted if inflation were to remain persistently below 2 percent. However, because a higher rate of\ninflation can arguably be achieved over time through a sufficiently tight labor market, this risk seems low\nto me as long as the Federal Reserve is committed to achieving its inflation objective.\n24 In the simulations reported by Reifschneider, “Gauging the Ability of the FOMC to Respond to Future\nRecessions,” in note 8, overcoming the effects of the zero lower bound during a severe recession would\nrequire about $4 trillion in asset purchases and pledging to stay low for even longer if the average future\nlevel of the federal funds rate is only 2 percent.\n\n- 16 -\nmoment. But that does not mean that the Federal Reserve would be unable to provide\nappreciable accommodation should the ongoing expansion falter in the near term. In\naddition to taking the federal funds rate back down to nearly zero, the FOMC could\nresume asset purchases and announce its intention to keep the federal funds rate at this\nlevel until conditions had improved markedly--although with long-term interest rates\nalready quite low, the net stimulus that would result might be somewhat reduced.\nDespite these caveats, I expect that forward guidance and asset purchases will\nremain important components of the Fed’s policy toolkit. In addition, it is critical that the\nFederal Reserve and other supervisory agencies continue to do all they can to ensure a\nstrong and resilient financial system. That said, these tools are not a panacea, and future\npolicymakers could find that they are not adequate to deal with deep and prolonged\neconomic downturns. For these reasons, policymakers and society more broadly may\nwant to explore additional options for helping to foster a strong economy.\nOn the monetary policy side, future policymakers might choose to consider some\nadditional tools that have been employed by other central banks, though adding them to\nour toolkit would require a very careful weighing of costs and benefits and, in some\ncases, could require legislation. For example, future policymakers may wish to explore\nthe possibility of purchasing a broader range of assets. Beyond that, some observers have\nsuggested raising the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation objective or implementing policy\nthrough alternative monetary policy frameworks, such as price-level or nominal GDP\ntargeting. I should stress, however, that the FOMC is not actively considering these\nadditional tools and policy frameworks, although they are important subjects for research.\n\n- 17 -\nBeyond monetary policy, fiscal policy has traditionally played an important role\nin dealing with severe economic downturns. A wide range of possible fiscal policy tools\nand approaches could enhance the cyclical stability of the economy.25 For example, steps\ncould be taken to increase the effectiveness of the automatic stabilizers, and some\neconomists have proposed that greater fiscal support could be usefully provided to state\nand local governments during recessions. As always, it would be important to ensure that\nany fiscal policy changes did not compromise long-run fiscal sustainability.\nFinally, and most ambitiously, as a society we should explore ways to raise\nproductivity growth. Stronger productivity growth would tend to raise the average level\nof interest rates and therefore would provide the Federal Reserve with greater scope to\nease monetary policy in the event of a recession. But more importantly, stronger\nproductivity growth would enhance Americans’ living standards. Though outside the\nnarrow field of monetary policy, many possibilities in this arena are worth considering,\nincluding improving our educational system and investing more in worker training;\npromoting capital investment and research spending, both private and public; and looking\nfor ways to reduce regulatory burdens while protecting important economic, financial,\nand social goals.\nConclusion\n25 For further discussion of ways to enhance the effectiveness of fiscal policy in stabilizing the economy,\nsee Xavier Debrun and Radhicka Kapoor (2010), “Fiscal Policy and Macroeconomic Stability: Automatic\nStabilizers Work, Always and Everywhere,” IMF Working Paper WP/10/111 (Washington: International\nMonetary Fund, May), https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2010/wp10111.pdf; Antonio Fatás and\nIlian Mihov (2012), “Fiscal Policy as a Stabilization Tool,” B.E.

New\npolicy tools, which helped the Federal Reserve respond to the financial crisis and Great\nRecession, are likely to remain useful in dealing with future downturns. Additional tools\nmay be needed and will be the subject of research and debate. But even if average\ninterest rates remain lower than in the past, I believe that monetary policy will, under\nmost conditions, be able to respond effectively.\ni Note: On August 29, 2016, a typo was corrected to change the line color cited from “blue” to “red” in the\nfollowing sentence: “As the red dashed line shows, the federal funds rate would fall far below zero if\npolicy were unconstrained, thereby causing long-term interest rates to fall sharply.”\n\nFigure 1\nMedian of Individual FOMC Participants' June 2016 Federal Funds Rate Projections\n(shaded area shows 70% confidence interval)\n5 5\n4 4\n3 3\n2 2\n1 1\n0 0\nQ1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4\n2015 2016 2017 2018\nNote: Confidence interval equals the median of the end-of-year funds rate paths projected by individual FOMC\nparticipants (interpolated quarterly), plus or minus the average root mean squared prediction error for 0 to 9\nquarters ahead made by private and government forecasters over the past 20 years, subject to an effective\nlower bound of 12.5 basis points.\nSource: June 2016 Summary of Economic Projections and Federal Reserve Board staff.\n\nConventional Monetary Easing during Past Recessions and Accompanying Economic Conditions\nPeak Rate of 12-\nTotal Amount of Estimated Stance of Labor Utilization at\nMonth Core PCE\nNational Bureau of Economic Research Conventional Monetary Policy at the Start of the\nInflation during the\nRecession Dates Monetary Easing the Start of Easing Recession3\nRecession\n(percent)1 (percent)2 (percent)\n(percent)\nAugust 1957 to April 1958 2.9 — 3.24 -1.3\nApril 1960 to February 1961 2.8 — 2.1 -.3\nDecember 1969 to November 1970 5.5 0.5 4.8 -2.4\nNovember 1973 to March 1975 7.7 3.0 10.2 -1.4\nJanuary 1980 to July 1980 4.8 3.2 9.1 -.2\nJuly 1981 to November 1982 10.4 7.1 8.8 1.0\nJuly 1990 to March 1991 5.3 1.7 4.3 -.4\nMarch 2001 to November 2001 4.8 1.9 2.0 -.8\nDecember 2007 to June 2009 5.1 1.9 2.3 .1\nNote: 1.

    "text": "Presentation to the Bank of Japan’s 12Th International Conference\nOf the Institute for Monetary and Economic Studies\n(Tokyo, Japan)\nby Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of\nSan Francisco\nFor delivery May 31, 2005, 2 P.M. Tokyo, Japan, 10 P.M. (May 30) Pacific Daylight Time,\n1 A.M. (May 31) Eastern\nPolicymaking on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC):\nTransparency and Continuity\nIt is a pleasure to take part in this conference. I thank the Bank of Japan for inviting me\nto share my views on incentive problems in monetary policy committees at central banks.\nI thought I would organize my remarks around two issues discussed in the paper by Fujiki\n(2005) and in the sessions—transparency and continuity—and do so in the context of two recent\nissues confronting the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC): (1) its recent decision to\nexpedite the release of the minutes of its meetings; and (2) its recent discussion regarding the\nadoption of a numerical definition of price stability.\nOver the past decade, the FOMC has continually re-assessed the costs and benefits of\nvarious steps toward greater transparency and has made several significant increases in policy\ncommunication and openness. In February 1994, just months before I became a Federal Reserve\nGovernor, the FOMC started to explicitly announce changes in the federal funds rate target.\nLater that year, the FOMC added descriptions of the state of the economy and the rationale for\nthe policy action to the post-meeting press release. In January 2000, the FOMC introduced a\nstatement describing the “balance of risks” to the outlook, and in March 2002 began releasing the\nvotes of individual Committee members and the preferred policy choices of any dissenters. In\nAugust 2003, the Committee added explicit forward-looking language concerning future policy\n1\n\ninto its statement. Finally, in December 2004, it decided to release the minutes of its meetings\nwith only a three-week delay. Previously, the minutes were made public with a five- to eight-\nweek lag, just after the subsequent meeting and were, hence, less relevant to policy.\nThis decision to speed up the release of the minutes occurred several months after I\nreturned to the FOMC table as President of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. I think it\nillustrates some of the important issues relating to transparency in monetary policy committees.\nIn considering whether to expedite the release of the minutes, potential costs were\ncertainly recognized. Financial markets could misinterpret and overreact to the minutes. Greater\nemphasis on the minutes might also lead to less productive discussions at the meetings, because\neven speculative and off-the-cuff commentary would soon be out in the open and, hence,\ndiscouraged. On the benefit side, however, expedited release of the FOMC minutes provides\nmore timely information to the public about the rationale for monetary policy actions and a more\nnuanced explanation of the reasons for the Committee’s decisions. Such a move toward greater\ntransparency facilitates accountability, which is essential for unelected central bankers in a\ndemocratic society, and might make monetary policy more effective by helping to align financial\nmarket expectations with policy objectives.1\nOne impact of expedited release of the minutes is that it results in the earlier airing of\ndifferences of opinion among members. A more subtle issue is whether the exposure of such\ndifferences might affect the degree of collegiality in the Committee. This issue is important\nbecause, in my view, cooperation is critical to the FOMC’s success. My sense is that FOMC\nparticipants are highly motivated to cooperate in seeking, finding, and articulating a Committee\n1 See Swanson (2004).\n2\n\nconsensus and their ability to do so enhances the credibility, legitimacy, and likely effectiveness\nof monetary policy. In fact, I think FOMC members behave far less individualistically and\nstrategically than assumed in some of the models summarized in Fujiki (2005). I do not find this\nterribly surprising. Sociologists find that in group situations, individuals are typically motivated\nto build on common ground to resolve differences of opinion and attain agreement.2 Without\nsuch a sense of group solidarity, a 19-member committee like the FOMC could find it so time-\nconsuming as to be practically infeasible to craft even a short, post-meeting statement\ncommanding majority agreement. Such sociological reasoning might also explain why FOMC\ndissents are so rare.\nThe jury is still out on whether the earlier exposure of differences of opinion will affect\nthe sense of collegiality in the FOMC. Earlier release of the minutes affords greater flexibility\nfor members to express their personal views publicly, for example in speeches, without creating\nundue market confusion. My guess is that this will make it easier, not harder, to attain\nconsensus, but time will tell.\nA second issue relating to communication and transparency that the FOMC discussed in\nFebruary 2005 is whether to adopt an explicit, numerical price-related objective for monetary\npolicy. The Committee decided to hold off for now, but I am sure that, along with other issues in\nmonetary policy communication, this topic will be on the table again in the future.\nThe Federal Reserve Act gives the FOMC a dual mandate—to pursue maximum\nsustainable employment and price stability—but does not define either objective. My personal\nview is that the quantification of the long-run price-stability objective could offer several\n2 See Haslam (2004).\n3\n\nbenefits. In terms of Committee operations, it could help to focus and clarify our own\ndiscussions. It could also help to anchor the public's long-term inflation expectations from being\npushed too far up or down. That is, a numerical long-run inflation objective may help avoid both\ndestabilizing inflation scares and pernicious price deflations. Indeed, a credible inflation\nobjective could enhance the flexibility of monetary policy to respond to the real effects of\nadverse shocks.\nAs with any move toward greater transparency, there are potential drawbacks. A main\nconcern is the possibility that the enunciation of an inflation objective will be perceived as or\nresult in a downweighting of the Committee’s maximum employment mandate. To guard against\nmiscommunication, the nature of this objective would have to be very clearly stated as a long-run\ngoal only, with the path for attaining it dependent on the implications for other Fed objectives,\nespecially employment and financial stability.\nThe adoption of an inflation objective also raises issues related to the continuity of\nFOMC behavior. The price stability mandate is overarching because it is included in the Federal\nReserve Act. But the interpretation of that mandate is left up to the Committee. Since one\nFOMC cannot bind future FOMCs, the potential for discontinuity could be large if individual\nviews on the appropriate numerical objective were to change significantly over time or as a result\nof changes in the membership.\nWith respect to the likely stability of individual views over time, the evolution of my own\nthinking on this topic is perhaps instructive. When I was a Federal Reserve Governor, the\nFOMC discussed a numerical objective for inflation at its July 1996 meeting. At that meeting,\nthere was some consensus among the participants, including myself, for a 2 percent long-run\n4\n\nobjective for consumer price index (CPI) inflation. From an economic standpoint, I believe the\nchoice of an inflation objective should depend on an evaluation of the costs and benefits of very\nlow inflation. Since then, there have been several important economic developments relevant to\nthis choice. I argued in 1996 that the inflation objective should contain a cushion sufficient to\ngrease the wheels of the labor market. The potential negative impact of downward nominal wage\nrigidity on real economic performance diminishes, however, with productivity growth, which\nraises average wage growth. As it turns out, high productivity growth in the U.S. during the past\ndecade has made downward wage rigidity a non-issue, suggesting that a lower inflation buffer is\nsufficient. But, for me, this shift has been offset by the experience of very low inflation in the\nU.S. and deflation here in Japan, which has heightened my concern relating to the zero lower\nbound on the policy interest rate. Other relevant economic factors include the magnitude of the\nneutral real funds rate, the degree of macroeconomic volatility, and methodological changes\naffecting measurement biases.\nTaking all of these factors into account, I find myself still pretty comfortable with the\nnumerical objective I had recommended almost a decade ago. More specifically, I would now\nfavor a 1.5 percent numerical objective for inflation as measured using the core personal\nconsumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which, given the recent average differences in\nmeasurement bias, corresponds to a 2 percent objective for the core CPI. If the stability of my\nown views on the appropriate numerical inflation objective is representative, it seems likely that\nthe FOMC’s numerical inflation objective would probably change fairly little over time due to\neconomic factors.\n5\n\nThe numerical inflation objective could also potentially evolve with changes in the\nmembership of the FOMC, assuming some divergence in views among members. In fact,\nhowever, a number of Committee members have individually opined on this topic and the actual\ndifferences of opinion turn out to be rather small. I would characterize a long-run inflation\nobjective centered on 1.5 percent for core PCE inflation as a “modal” view. Even if there were\nmore significant differences of opinion, an advantage of a monetary policy committee is that a\nslow, continuous transition of new members is apt to produce greater continuity than might occur\nwith a single central banker, where the replacement of the Governor could result in discrete\npolicy shifts. In addition, the “sociological” considerations I discussed earlier, which foster\ncooperation and consensus, could encourage new members to support the goals endorsed by the\nprior committee. In practice, then, I think there would be ample continuity in the FOMC’s\ninflation target.\nContinuity is an especially important issue facing the FOMC now, as Chairman\nGreenspan’s term as a Federal Reserve Governor comes to an end. The Chairman changes\ninfrequently—we have had only two in the past quarter-century. But one of the strengths of the\nFOMC is the broad experience of its members and staff. During the transition to a new\nChairman, this should help ensure continuity.\nTo conclude, I would like to stress that there are no final answers, that transparency and\ncontinuity are important issues which we face on the FOMC at almost every meeting.\nReferences\n6\n\nFujiki, Hiroshi. 2005. “The Monetary Policy Committee and the Incentive Problem: A Selective\nSurvey.” Forthcoming in Monetary and Economic Studies, 23 (S-1).

Yellen, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery October 18, 2005 12:40 PM Mountain Time, 2:40 PM Eastern,\n11:40 AM Pacific\nUpdate on the U.S Economy\nGood afternoon. It’s a pleasure to be here in Salt Lake City with you today. I’m\ndelighted to have the opportunity to outline my thoughts on the U.S. economy and on\nmonetary policy. I hope you’ll have some comments and questions for me afterward. As\nPresident of the Federal Reserve Bank serving Utah and eight other Western states, it is\nmy job to bring the economic insights and perspectives of business leaders in our region\ninto deliberations at the policy table. So I am eager to know what issues and\ndevelopments are particularly on your minds. Let me note, by the way, that my\ncomments in these remarks and in the Q&A reflect my own opinions, not necessarily\nthose of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve.\nI’ll start by addressing some major developments in the U.S. economy relating to\nemployment and output growth. I’ll review the recent past and indicate my sense of the\neconomy’s likely path going forward, focusing particularly on risks I see relating to\nenergy and the housing sector. Next I’ll turn to the inflation picture. Finally, I’ll\nconclude with some thoughts on the course of monetary policy in the U.S.\nSix weeks have now passed since Katrina and Rita delivered powerful blows to\nthe U.S. Gulf Coast. Their consequences are by no means behind us and are shaping the\nnear-term outlook in important ways. It goes without saying that the human tragedy has\nbeen enormous. According to a recent report, Louisiana alone attributes nearly a\n1\n\nthousand deaths just to Katrina. The economic consequences for the region also are\nenormous. Millions of people were displaced, thousands of businesses and jobs were\ndisrupted or destroyed, and the infrastructure took a severe beating. Hurricane Rita, of\ncourse, compounded the economic damage.\nStaring into the face of such disasters, it is natural at first to want to use every tool\nat hand to try to help—which is precisely what the people of Utah did. I understand that\nUtahns mobilized immediately, sending volunteers to the stricken area and welcoming\nover five hundred evacuees to the state. The shelter that was put together so quickly at\nCamp Williams has been called a “mini-city,” with crucial services, like medical support\nand schooling, as well as those amenities—like hair salons and entertainment—that help\ngive people a glimpse of “ordinary” life in such an extraordinary situation. I understand\nthat now that Camp Williams is closed, apartments or hotels have been found for those\nwho are staying in the area, and many of the children are registered in local schools. This\nopen-handedness, this open-heartedness of the people here has, indeed, been a bright ray\nof light amid the dark despair that followed those storms.\nAs a policymaker, I, too, have been concerned about how best to help. As you\nknow, at the September 20th meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the\nmembers voted to continue on the path of gradual tightening that began more than a year\nago and increased the target federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 3.75 percent. This\nwas a very conscious decision. It reflected a conviction, which I share, that monetary\npolicy’s greatest contribution in a situation like this is in keeping the national economy\non an even keel. Monetary policy, unfortunately, has little scope to cushion the\nimmediate economic fallout because monetary actions can’t be directed only at a\n2\n\nparticular area of the country and because their effects take time to be felt. Instead, it’s\nappropriate to use the tools of fiscal policy—especially government spending and\ntransfers—to address the immediate crisis, and this process is, indeed, underway.\nWhen Hurricane Katrina hit at the end of August, the economy was doing quite\nwell. Over the preceding two and a half years, real GDP had grown steadily at, or above,\nits potential or long-run sustainable pace, which, due to continued robust structural\nproductivity, is estimated at three to three and a quarter percent. In the second quarter,\nthe latest for which we have data, real GDP performance was similar—that is, it grew by\nthree and a quarter percent. With this stretch of near or above-trend growth in economic\nactivity, slack in resource use has gradually, but steadily, diminished—that is, jobs have\nincreased by more than enough to absorb a growing workforce. Unemployment has\ndeclined, and capacity utilization has risen. Indeed, the latest reading on unemployment\nbefore the storm was for August, and it came in at 4.9 percent, a number that’s near\nconventional estimates consistent with so-called “full employment.”\nMy medium-term outlook, before Katrina, was for growth averaging a pace\nsufficient to keep the economy operating in the vicinity of full employment, albeit with\nnotable risks, particularly relating to energy prices and housing, two factors I will discuss\nin greater detail in just a moment. Evidence amassed since the storms suggests that the\neconomy has been remarkably resilient and apt to remain on a solid track even though the\nstorms will probably alter the near-term trajectory somewhat. The disruptions they\ncaused will likely put a noticeable dent in overall growth of output and employment in\nthe second half of this year, compared to earlier forecasts; indeed, in September, the\nunemployment rate rose by a couple of tenths of a percentage point to 5.1 percent, and\n3\n\nmost of this increase was probably due to the temporary effects of Katrina. For 2006, it\nseems likely that growth will pick up in the first half, as energy production comes fully\nback on line and rebuilding kicks in, and then will settle into a trend-like pattern in the\nsecond half.\nNow to the two risks to output growth and employment that I mentioned—energy\nprices and housing. As I said, these were present even before Katrina struck. Over the\ntwo previous years, energy prices had surged worldwide, with the price of oil more than\ndoubling and even spiking at one point to over $70 per barrel. The macroeconomic effect\nof higher energy prices is to dampen aggregate demand, as the additional amount that\nhouseholds are forced to spend for the same amount of gasoline, natural gas, heating oil,\nand so on, diminishes their ability to spend on other goods and services. Likewise, firms\nfeel the bite in narrower profit margins which may crimp the amount they decide to spend\non investment in plant and equipment.\nThe outlook for trend-like growth in output that I discussed earlier incorporates\nnoticeable effects of the energy shock on household and business spending. However,\nthere are inevitable uncertainties about the intensity of these effects. For example, the\nintensity depends importantly on whether the higher prices are viewed as transitory—a\npassing phenomenon—or as a more permanent feature of the economic landscape. If\nthey are seen as largely transitory, then consumers and firms typically try to maintain\nsomething close to their usual level of spending while the higher prices last—perhaps by\ndipping into their reserves. If higher energy prices are expected to persist, however, a\ndeeper and longer-lasting cutback in spending is more likely.\n4\n\nTo gauge perceptions concerning the permanence of higher energy prices, the\nnatural place to look is at futures prices. Even before Katrina, they suggested that higher\nprices may be here to stay. For example, during the run-up of spot oil prices over the past\nyear and a half, far-dated futures prices rose sharply. Most likely, these futures prices\nreflected the sense that global demand for oil would remain strong in an environment\nwhere there is little excess supply available and where geopolitical uncertainty creates\nrisks to existing supplies.\nWith first Katrina and then Rita slamming into the Gulf Coast, the energy\nsituation naturally has become even more of a concern, since that area has such an\nextensive drilling, refining, and distribution infrastructure. For example, offshore crude\noil and natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico accounts for approximately 29\npercent and 20 percent, respectively, of total U.S. production levels. Importantly, Gulf\nCoast refineries account for a whopping 47 percent of total U.S. refining capacity. The\nlatest reports indicate that some of the energy infrastructure of the Gulf has been restored,\nbut progress has been slower than originally expected. Roughly 65 percent of offshore\noil and 56 percent of offshore gas production in the Gulf still remains shut in, and about\nten percent of U.S. refinery capacity is off line. Energy prices have been quite volatile.\nAt this point, retail gasoline and natural gas prices remain well above pre-Katrina levels,\nwhile oil prices and wholesale gasoline prices have actually fallen below those prevailing\nbefore the hurricanes.\nEarly signs suggest that spending is holding up reasonably well in the wake of\nhigher energy prices, although consumer confidence dropped substantially after the\n5\n\nstorms. It will obviously be important to monitor consumer spending carefully in the\nmonths ahead, as higher energy prices show up in winter heating and electricity bills.\nIn addition to the uncertainties raised by higher energy prices, there are downside\nrisks to economic growth relating to the housing market. This sector has been a key\nsource of strength in the current expansion, and the concern is that, if house prices fell,\nthe negative impact on household wealth could lead to a pullback in consumer spending.\nCertainly, analyses do indicate that house prices are abnormally high—that there is a\n“bubble” element, even accounting for factors that would support high house prices, such\nas low mortgage interest rates. So a reversal is certainly a possibility. Moreover, even\nthe portion of house prices that is explained by low mortgage rates is at risk. There is a\ncontroversy about just why the rates have stayed so low. Over the past year, the Fed has\nraised the federal funds rate significantly. Normally, long-term interest rates also rise\nwith increases in the expected path for the federal funds rate. But, long-term rates—such\nas those on 30-year fixed rate mortgages—have actually fallen over the period. This is\nwhat Chairman Greenspan has labelled a conundrum because there seems to be no\nconvincing explanation for it. So, we can’t rule out the possibility that they would rise to\na more normal relationship with short-term rates. This obviously might take some of the\n“oomph” out of the housing market. My bottom line is that while I’m certainly not\npredicting anything about future house price movements, I think it’s obvious that a\nsubstantial cooling off of the housing sector represents a downside risk to the outlook for\ngrowth.\nMy focus thus far has been on developments that relate to the Fed’s objective of\nkeeping the economy growing and operating in the vicinity of full employment.\n6\n\nHowever, like central banks worldwide, the Federal Reserve is also keenly focused on\nmaintaining price stability. In my judgment, inflation has been relatively well-contained\nand essentially compatible with the Fed’s price stability objective, although rapid\nincreases in energy prices over the past year have boosted headline CPI inflation to a\nwhopping 4.7% over the last twelve months, a level not seen since 1991. Abstracting\nfrom volatile food and energy prices, however, core consumer price inflation, as\nmeasured by the CPI, registered a moderate 2.1 percent over the 12 months ending in\nSeptember. A second key index of core consumer prices, the core PCE, or personal\nconsumption expenditures index, also rose 2 percent over the 12 months ending in\nAugust. There is an anomaly here because the PCE price index typically rises about 0.5\npercent less rapidly than the core CPI measure, and the aberrant difference between the\ntwo measures places inflation over the past 12 months, based on the core PCE, near the\ntop of my comfort range. In contrast, over the past six months, core inflation has been\nmore modest. The core PCE was up 1.6% at an annual rate in the six months ending in\nAugust—which is right near the middle of my preferred range. Core CPI inflation has\nbeen well behaved as well.\nThe question for policy, of course, concerns the future, not the past. Increases in\nenergy prices, exacerbated by events in the Gulf Coast, are likely to continue boosting\nheadline inflation. And a key question is whether higher energy prices also will elevate\ncore inflation. In part, this depends on whether businesses are able to pass through higher\nenergy and material prices or instead are forced to absorb them into the bottom line.\nMany of our contacts report that keen competition, coupled with healthy profit margins,\nis limiting their ability to pass these costs along. To the extent that there is some pass-\n7\n\nthrough, however, core inflation could be higher, for a time. Even so, any boost in core\ninflation should prove transitory if energy prices stabilize unless—and it’s a big unless—\nthese developments impact wage and salary developments in a broad-based way. Those\nof you who lived through the 1970s will remember that higher oil prices touched off a\nwage-price spiral that pushed inflation into double-digit territory. At this stage, wage and\nsalary growth seems quite well-contained, and I see no evidence of feedbacks from\nenergy prices to wage bargaining. The risk, though, is that, without appropriate policy,\nwe could see a repetition of the 70’s type dynamic.\nNaturally, much research has gone into analyzing what happened during the\n1970s, and I’m glad to report that there are major differences between now and then.\nOne of the key findings concerns the role that inflation expectations play in generating\nthe wage-price spiral. To sum up a great deal of research very briefly, the idea is that\ninflation expectations are like self-fulfilling prophecies. If people expect higher inflation,\nthey will behave in the marketplace in ways that will actually generate higher inflation;\nfor example, they will rush to make purchases thinking that tomorrow’s price will be\nhigher than today’s. And, higher expected inflation will tend to be built into wage\nbargaining, which raises costs to businesses that, in turn, may get built into the prices of\ntheir products. Unwinding the inflationary spiral is no easy task. In the early 1980s, the\nFed did it by slamming hard on the brakes. The costs of this action were high—the\neconomy went through a double-dip recession, and the unemployment rate hit 10 percent\nin 1982. Since then, the Fed has continued to work to lower the inflation rate with\nconsiderable success. As a result, it appears that the public expects inflation to remain in\n8\n\na low range—as economists express it, inflation expectations have become “well\nanchored” to price stability.\nWhat’s the evidence on people’s inflation expectations? One source of\ninformation comes from responses to surveys about inflation expectations. A recent\nsurvey taken by the University of Michigan recorded a large jump in inflation\nexpectations over the next twelve months, and a smaller increase in longer-term\nexpectations. But I would not read too much into this, since the short-term survey\nresults reflect recent energy price developments, and they also account for at least part\nof the uptick in longer-term expectations.\nAn alternative source of information on inflation expectations comes from\nanalyses using a financial instrument that is called TIPS for short. This stands for\nTreasury Inflation-Protected Security, a class of government debt obligation that was\nfirst issued in 1997. The key feature of TIPS is that the payments to investors adjust\nautomatically to compensate for the actual change in the CPI. Conventional Treasury\nsecurities, in contrast, do not provide such protection, so investors in those securities\nprotect themselves by demanding nominal interest rates that compensate them for\nexpected inflation as well as for bearing the risk that actual inflation could turn out to\ndiffer from their expectations. In principle, having information from both types of\nTreasury securities allows researchers to separate out the inflation compensation\ncomponent embedded in nominal interest rates, and this provides a rough proxy for\ninflation expectations.1\n1 For more on TIPS, see “Inflation Expectations: How the Market Speaks,” by Simon Kwan, FRBSF\nEconomic Letter 2005-25.\n9\n\nUsing this kind of analysis, we can obtain an estimate of inflation compensation\nover various time horizons. Not surprisingly, compensation for average inflation over\nthe next five years has risen as energy prices have surged. However, it is notable that\nlonger-term inflation expectations—those covering the period from five years ahead to\nten years ahead—appear to have declined by half a percentage point since the Fed\nbegan tightening policy. This development supports the view that the public has\nconfidence in the FOMC’s commitment to price stability, even in the face of a large\nenergy price shock. However, the Federal Reserve cannot take it for granted that\ninflation expectations will remain well-contained. Rather, it is the job of a central bank\nto earn, through its actions, the public’s confidence in its commitment to price stability.\nThis brings me to a discussion of recent Fed actions. Over the past sixteen\nmonths, with the U.S. economy growing slightly above trend and unemployment\ngradually declining toward normal levels, the Federal Open Market Committee has been\nlifting its foot off the monetary accelerator at a measured pace--bit by bit. We’ve been\ngradually removing the policy accommodation that had been put in place during the 2001\nrecession and then held there during the slow recovery when there was even a risk of\ndeflation. The objective of these policy actions has been to position the economy on a\ntrajectory characterized by “full employment” and price stability—the two main policy\ngoals articulated in the Federal Reserve Act. As slack in labor markets is absorbed, real\noutput growth must converge toward a sustainable long-run pace for inflation to remain\nunder control. This, in turn, requires that monetary policy revert to a so-called “neutral”\nstance.\n10\n\nAfter eleven 25-basis point upward moves since June 2004, the federal funds rate\nnow stands at 3.75 percent, so the question of exactly what constitutes a neutral stance\nhas become more compelling. Conceptually, policy can be deemed “neutral” when the\nfederal funds rate reaches a level that is consistent with full employment of labor and\ncapital resources over the intermediate run. The value of this rate depends on the strength\nof spending—that is, the aggregate demand for U.S. produced goods and services.\nAggregate demand, in turn, depends on a number of factors. These include fiscal policy;\nthe pace of growth in our main trading partners; movements in asset prices, such as\nstocks and housing, that influence the propensity of households to save and spend; the\nslope of the yield curve, which determines the levels of long-term interest rates associated\nwith any given value of the federal funds rate; and the pace of technological change,\nwhich influences investment spending. The neutral value of the federal funds rate also\ndepends on, and rises roughly in tandem with, inflation itself, because it is mainly\ninflation-adjusted, or real, not nominal interest rates, that influence spending.\nThe neutral rate is easy to define conceptually, but it’s difficult to know in\npractice when we’re there, because estimates of the neutral rate are highly uncertain and\nthe factors influencing that rate can change over time.2 That said, a number of different\ntechniques can be used to estimate the neutral rate and, based on such estimates, I\nconsider it reasonable to put the current neutral rate in the range of 3-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent.\nAt 3-3/4 percent, the current federal funds rate is toward the lower end of this band. This\nsuggests a presumption that the rate will need to be raised further. Indeed, financial\nmarkets now appear to expect the funds rate to peak at about 4½ percent—in the middle\n2 “Estimating the ‘Neutral’ Real Interest Rate in Real Time,” by Tao Wu, FRBSF Economic Letter 2005-27\n[Forthcoming].\n11\n\nof this neutral range. Again though, I want to emphasize that there is no way to know\nprecisely what the neutral stance is.\nTo my mind this means that, as the federal funds rate target nears a reasonable\nestimate of the neutral rate, monetary policy must become more and more dependent on\nincoming data relating to the strength of aggregate spending. It is equally important, of\ncourse, to monitor developments relating to inflation, because the very notion that a\nneutral policy stance is appropriate is premised on the assumption that inflation is and\nwill remain well-contained in a zone corresponding to price stability.\nThe ideal trajectory for the economy and the funds rate that I have described\nremains a plausible, even probable, scenario. At its September meeting, the risks\nengendered by Hurricane Katrina were very much on the minds of Committee members.\nSharp jumps in energy prices always put U.S. monetary policy on the horns of a dilemma.\nOn one side, the negative impact on spending tends to damp economic activity, which\ncalls for a more accommodative policy, although in this case, the rebuilding effort will\nprovide an important offset. On the other side, higher energy prices add to inflationary\npressures, potentially calling for a tighter policy. Although the effects of Katrina and\nRita will remain uncertain for some time and the storms may alter the pattern of growth\nover the next year or so, it seems likely that economy will prove resilient in the medium\nterm. With long-term inflation expectations still well-contained, the prospects for core\ninflation over the medium term also, to my mind, look favorable. It thus made sense to\nme to continue the gradual removal of policy accommodation.\nGoing forward, it will be necessary to continue to monitor developments closely\nand weigh options carefully. As I noted, the data dependence of policy becomes more\n12\n\ncritical the closer we get to a neutral stance. One option that is clearly not on the table is\nallowing an unacceptable rise in inflation. It has taken many years of consistent\nperformance for the Federal Reserve to earn the public’s confidence in its commitment to\nprice stability, and this consistency of purpose remains essential.\n# # #\n13",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n9:00 a.m. EDT\nOctober 30, 2014\nWelcoming Remarks by\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n“National Summit on Diversity in the Economics Profession”\nA Conference Sponsored by the American Economic Association and the\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nWashington, D.C.\nOctober 30, 2014\n\nI am very pleased that the American Economic Association (AEA) and the\nFederal Reserve Board have organized this conference on an important issue for our\nprofession.\nIn trying to raise awareness of diversity in the economics profession, I am aided\nby the fact that economists are well acquainted with the concept of diversity from their\nwork. When conducting a survey, economists understand that the results will be more\nmeaningful when the diversity of the sample approaches the diversity of the population\nbeing studied. In finance, we know that diversity is fundamentally important in\nspreading risk. History shows that economies develop and become more stable through\ndiversification. Often, in the things economists study and the methods we use, diversity\nis a good thing.\nTo cite another example, research by economists and other social scientists\nsupports the view that considering a diversity of perspectives and ideas leads to better\ndecisions in an organization. I believe decisions by the Federal Reserve Board and the\nFederal Open Market Committee are better because of the range of views and\nperspectives brought to the table by my fellow policymakers, and I have encouraged this\napproach to decisionmaking at all levels and throughout the Fed System.\nOne way to promote diversity of ideas is to promote diversity among the people\nwe rely on for those ideas, including more than 300 Ph.D. economists who serve at the\nBoard and more than 400 serving at the Fed’s 12 Reserve Banks. At the Board, our\nOffice of Diversity and Inclusion coordinates this effort, but everyone involved in the\nrecruiting, hiring, management, and promotion of economists is engaged in it as well.\n\n- 2 -\nWhen I was Vice Chair, I knew that promoting diversity among Fed economists was a\npriority for Chairman Bernanke, and it continues to be a priority for me.\nIn 1977, when I joined the Board staff, I was one of relatively few women\neconomists here. Since then, there have been significant gains in diversity at the Board\nand throughout the System. The Federal Reserve is committed to achieving further\nprogress, and to better understanding the challenges to improving diversity throughout\nthe economics profession. As an employer, the Fed is very serious about meeting its\nobligation to provide equal opportunity, and I also believe that diversity makes the Fed\nmore effective in carrying out its mission, for reasons such as the one I mentioned a\nmoment ago.\nBut this conference offers an important opportunity to investigate all of the\npossible factors that influence the extent of diversity among economists at the Federal\nReserve and elsewhere, including those factors that are affecting the education and\nadvancement of economists everywhere in the United States.\nAs a longtime member of the AEA, I am proud of the work our association has\ndone to collect data and study diversity in the economics profession. Among the\nquestions raised by the AEA’s work on this topic is why relatively few women and\nminorities seem to consider economics as a concentration in college. The evidence is\nfairly clear that majoring in economics offers relatively high returns to college graduates\nwhether or not they pursue further education in economics. It is worth knowing, for\nexample, what undergrads who might consider concentrating in economics think about\nthe curriculum and the employment prospects for economics majors compared with what\nthose prospects actually are. To what extent might the lack of diversity among\n\n- 3 -\neconomics majors reflect a more general need to make basic economics more relevant\nand otherwise appealing to undergrads?\nThe AEA has also done important work documenting and investigating the “leaky\npipeline,” trying to determine why some groups are more likely to abandon economics\neducation and work before, and even after, receiving Ph.D.s. In reviewing the data on the\nrepresentation and advancement of certain groups in the profession, there are differences\nin outcomes for women and minorities. To what extent are these disparities caused by\ndifferences in the experiences of those groups or due to broader and more general\nchallenges faced in academia? Do the leaks from the pipeline that may be more\nnoticeable for some groups reflect a broader lack of opportunity in academia? When\neconomists delve into why there isn’t more diversity among them, they end up asking\nabout what is being taught in college, how economists are being trained in graduate\nschool, and other questions that bear on the health and the future of the economics\nprofession in general.\nThese are not idle questions. All of you know that there has been a fair amount of\npublic debate in recent years about the health of the economics profession, prompted in\npart by the failure of many economists to comprehend the dire threats and foresee the\ndamage of the financial crisis. When the public asks whether economists did all they\ncould have to understand those threats, in part they are asking whether our profession did\nenough over the years to test ideas and assumptions that turned out in some cases to have\nbeen mistaken or misplaced. And part of that question is this one: Did the economics\nprofession recruit and promote the individuals best able to bring the energy, the fresh\n\n- 4 -\ninsights, and the renewal that every field and every body of knowledge needs to remain\nhealthy?\nWhen this question is asked again someday, when economics is tested by future\nchallenges, I hope that our profession will be able to say that we have done all we could\nto attract the best people and the best ideas. That, I believe, is the very worthy goal of\nthis conference, and I look forward to seeing it advanced by today’s discussions and by\nthe continuing commitment demonstrated by the AEA to diversity.\nThank you to those who organized the conference and to the distinguished\nmembers of our profession who have come here today to take part in it.",

    "text": "Presentation to Arizona State University’s 41st Annual Forecast Luncheon\nPhoenix, Arizona\nBy Janet L. Yellen,∗ President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery, Wednesday, December 1, 2004, 12:10 PM Mountain Time, 2:10 PM Eastern\nThe U.S. Economic Outlook: A Monetary Policymaker’s Perspective\nThanks for that very kind introduction, Dean Mittelstaedt. It’s a pleasure to participate in\nyour forecast luncheon, and I’m delighted to be able to set the stage for the other speakers by\ngiving you my views on the outlook for the nation’s economy and the implications for monetary\npolicy.\nAs Dean Mittelstaedt said, I began my tenure at the San Francisco Fed in June. Just a\ncouple of weeks later, I attended my first meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee as a\nReserve Bank President. At that June meeting, the Committee decided to raise the federal funds\nrate by 25 basis points, the first increase in over three years. Since then, there have been three\nmore meetings, and at each one, the Committee raised the funds rate by 25 basis points, bringing\nit now to two percent. With core consumer inflation running at one and a half to two percent,\nthe real—or inflation-adjusted—rate has moved from negative territory, where it had been for\nmore than three years, to a level of zero or a bit higher. The Committee’s November 10th press\nrelease states that, even at the current, higher level of the funds rate, monetary policy remains\naccommodative. One indication of the continuing monetary stimulus is that the real federal\nfunds rate remains well below its long-run average of around two and a half percent, depending\n∗ The opinions expressed in this speech are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Federal\nReserve Bank of San Francisco or of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n1\n\non which inflation measure you use. The statement notes that this stimulus, combined with\nrobust productivity growth, should provide ongoing support to economic activity.\nOne reason for the Committee’s decision to raise the federal funds rate is to undo, or\n“take back,” the policy of “exceptional easing” that the Committee put in place between 2001\nand 2003. During that period, the economy was struggling to overcome the headwinds from the\nbursting of the stock market bubble, heightened geopolitical risk and a wave of corporate\ngovernance scandals. With substantial and growing labor market slack, there was even a concern\nabout the risk of deflation. Though deflation was never very likely to be realized, it still made\nsense to address the risk by erring on the side of ease--taking out an “insurance policy” against\nthe possibility. As Japan knows all too well, deflation can lead to serious economic problems.\nAnother rationale for the increase in the federal funds rate is that we have been seeing\nmore positive signs in the economy and now can have greater confidence that the economy is on\ncourse for self-sustaining growth going forward. A broad range of economic data suggests that\nreal GDP is now growing modestly above trend, which, by most estimates, is around three and a\nquarter to three and a half percent. Recently, we’ve seen good news on manufacturing output\nand consumer spending.\nFinally, and very importantly, the data on the labor market turned out to be stunningly\ngood in October—the economy gained 337,000 jobs that month. After such a long—and, I\nmight add, surprisingly long—period when employment growth seemed to be stuck in the\ndoldrums, this news is very heartening. Growth in wage and salary income is critical to\nconsumer spending. More rapid employment growth thus improves the prospects for consumer\nspending, raising the odds that the remaining slack in the labor market will decline gradually\nover time.\n2\n\nThese results for the economy certainly look pretty good. But I think there are some\nimportant issues to consider about the economy’s performance so far that may have implications\nfor the outlook—and for monetary policy—going forward. In particular, it’s important to\nrecognize that, in order to get this performance, monetary policy has had to be extremely\naccommodative and for a very long time. Indeed, the economy has been getting a push not only\nfrom substantial monetary stimulus, but also from substantial fiscal stimulus, including several\ntax cut packages and increased spending on defense and homeland security.\nSo today, I’d like to spend a few moments exploring why this might be happening—that\nis, exploring what factors might be putting a drag on demand in the U.S., necessitating a lot of\nstimulus just to achieve trendlike growth. I’m going to focus on five factors altogether. Three\nappear to be having an impact now and may continue to do so next year; they are: higher oil\nprices, “restraint” in investment spending, and a large and growing trade gap. The remaining\ntwo have not had an impact yet, but they have the potential to exert a drag on the economy going\nforward; they are: the low personal saving rate and the waning impetus from fiscal policy.\nI’ll start with the oil price shock. The price of oil nearly doubled—from around thirty\ndollars a barrel last summer to fifty-five dollars—though most recently it has fallen back to\nbetween forty-five and fifty dollars. Higher oil prices act like a tax on households to depress\nspending on other goods and services at least to some extent. Let me hasten to say that this\neffect is nowhere near as dire as it was when oil price shocks hit the U.S. economy thirty years\nago. For one thing, even at fifty dollars a barrel, in real terms, oil prices are only about half what\nthey were in the 1970s. For another, the U.S. economy is much less dependent on oil today than\nit was thirty years ago.\n3\n\nNonetheless, higher oil prices do appear to be damping spending. Insofar as the higher\nprices are transitory, we’d expect consumers and firms not to change their spending patterns\nmuch, instead defending their living standards for the duration by consuming fewer oil products\nand by dipping into savings. But the concern is that oil prices may not be transitory—they may\nstay high, or go even higher. If that were to happen, we could expect consumers and firms to\nseal up their wallets somewhat tighter.\nIt’s extremely difficult to predict what will happen to oil prices, of course. But some\nrecent evidence from the futures markets can give us at least a sense of the probabilities. That\nevidence suggests that the market sees a large portion of the recent oil shock as long-lasting.\nFutures prices are not predicting as sharp a falloff in prices as they usually would.\nHigher oil prices also have an impact on inflation—at least for a time. The real issue here\nis whether that uptick in inflation gets incorporated into inflation expectations. We learned\nduring the 1970s that once that happens, wages and prices get built around those expectations,\nand inflation can start spiraling upward. Is this likely to happen now? Fortunately, it does not\nseem very likely. Again, we can turn to the markets for a sense of what inflation expectations\nlook like. Recently there has been a noticeable increase in the average compensation for\ninflation over the next five years implicit in the spread between the yield on Treasury bonds and\non Treasury inflation-indexed securities. Part of this undoubtedly reflects higher oil prices. But\nthere has been almost no change in the compensation for inflation from five to ten years into the\nfuture. The stability of compensation for this period presumably reflects the market’s view that\nthe Fed will remain vigilant in its long-run commitment to controlling inflation. Of course,\nactions ultimately speak louder than expectations, and the Fed will have to continue to\n4\n\ndemonstrate that it is willing to do what is necessary to ensure price stability in the U.S.\neconomy.\nA second drag on the U.S. economy relates to business investment. It may seem\nsurprising to pinpoint capital spending as a drag since growth in this type of spending has been\nstrong. However, it is probably less strong than one would expect, given the very favorable\n“fundamentals”— the low real interest rates that we’ve seen in recent years, solidly growing\ndemand, and very high corporate profits and cash flow; indeed, for the first time in decades,\nbusiness cash flow has actually exceeded total capital investment. This may suggest a\ncontinuation of the caution that has marked business decisionmaking in the wake of the terrorist\nthreats and the issues surrounding corporate governance.\nAnother element that could put the brakes on business investment is a slowdown in the\nhigh-tech sector. The data aren’t conclusive on this point, but they are suggestive: In the third\nquarter, real investment in high-tech fell to nine and a half percent—about half what it was over\nthe prior four quarters—high-tech manufacturing production slowed noticeably since midyear,\nand stock prices for some major high-tech firms slid; insofar as stock prices are good predictors,\nthis suggests a more subdued outlook. So, taken together, these data suggest that we should be\ncautious about assuming that the heady days of massive IT investment are likely to return any\ntime soon. The peak of strength in IT investment occurred at the end of 2000 when it was\nboosted by several special factors. One was the capital spending binge by telecom service\nproviders. A second was the build-up to Y2K. A third was the very rapid pace of diffusion of\npersonal computers and networks, a pace which may prove difficult to maintain much longer.\nMoreover, over the last year, we’ve seen that quality-adjusted computer prices haven’t been\nfalling as fast, and that may signal some slowing of technological innovation in this sector.\n5\n\nFinally, there is some industry opinion that the pace of software development is beginning to\ndrop off.\nA third drag on the economy relates to the trade gap. It has risen from near balance in the\nmid-1990s to a deficit of around $600 billion now, and it subtracted around a full percentage\npoint from real GDP growth in the first half of this year. Narrowing the trade gap depends—in\npart—on the strength of domestic demand among our trading partners, because that affects\ndemand for our exports. However, most of our major trading partners have had only sluggish\ngrowth in domestic demand recently, although their overall real GDP growth has been relatively\nhealthy. One economy with strong domestic demand has been China; but, even there, concerns\nabout overheating have led to efforts to restrain its economy. So long as these conditions prevail\namong our trading partners, they will not provide much impetus for growth in our own economy.\nFinally, non-oil import prices have risen by just under three percent over the past year, hardly\nenough to stem the trend of rising imports into this country.\nLet me turn to two factors that are not now, but have the potential to be, drags on the\neconomy going forward. First is the very low personal saving rate, which has fallen over the\npast decade from about seven percent to under half a percent in the third quarter of this year.\nPart of the reason that consumers are saving so little out of disposable income is that interest\nrates are low. In addition, their wealth has been on the rise; in the latter half of the 1990s, rising\nstock prices had a lot to do with the increase in wealth, but more recently, the main impetus has\nbeen house price appreciation. With interest rates rising now and housing prices unlikely to\ncontinuing advancing at their recent robust pace, consumers may want to get their finances in\norder and curtail their spending in order to bring the saving rate up to more normal levels.\n6\n\nFiscal policy is another factor that will come into play next year. The effects of the tax\ncuts and spending increases have been significantly positive for economic growth last year and\nthis year. Next year, however, if current plans remain in place, the impetus from fiscal policy\nwill wane. Most estimates suggest that fiscal policy could turn to being roughly neutral by 2005.\nThis means that the main impetus to growth will have to come from private sector spending.\nLet me next turn to the outlook for inflation. Over the last twelve months, inflation in the\ncore CPI—that is, in the index excluding volatile food and energy prices--has come in at a\nmoderate 2 percent. However, in the past couple of months, the readings have been a bit higher,\nmost likely reflecting some pass-through of higher oil prices into core prices as well as increases\nin both commodity and import prices. This uptick in core CPI inflation bears close watching, but\nit’s not a big concern at this point for a few reasons. First, inflation figures can be a bit volatile\nfrom month to month, so two months of data aren’t enough to establish a trend. Second, another\nmeasure of core inflation—based on the personal consumption expenditures index—has been\nmore modest. Third, as I mentioned earlier, supply-side effects should raise inflation only\ntemporarily unless they become embedded in inflation expectations. And longer-run inflationary\nexpectations seem to be well-anchored because the Fed’s strong commitment to maintaining\nprice stability is well understood. Furthermore, slack still remains in the labor market and that\nslack is working to moderate the pace of wage and salary increases, putting continued downward\npressure on inflation. So despite the uncertainties raised by oil prices, inflation—especially core\nconsumer inflation—seems to be relatively well-contained at present.\nI’d like to end my remarks today with some thoughts about the challenges monetary\npolicymakers are confronting now. We know that the current policy stance is accommodative,\nand that, as the expansion firms up, that degree of accommodation will have to diminish. But, by\n7\n\nhow much and at what pace? This will depend importantly on what actually happens to\nemployment, output and inflation going forward.\nIf the various drags on aggregate demand I’ve been discussing show signs of lessening, it may be\nappropriate to remove accommodation more rapidly. If they continue to weigh on the economy,\nor worsen, there will be more opportunities for the Committee to pause. The challenge, then, for\nmonetary policymakers is to be on high watch as developments unfold, to evaluate them with an\nopen mind, and to adjust the course of policy to achieve our dual mandate—promoting price\nstability and maximum sustainable employment.\n# # #\n8",

    "text": "Presentation to the Los Angeles Chapter, National Association for Business Economics (NABE)\nLos Angeles, CA\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on Thursday, January 19, 2006, 5:15 PM Pacific, 8:15 PM Eastern\n2006: A Year of Transition at the Federal Reserve\nGood afternoon, everyone, and thanks for inviting me to speak to you today. I’m going\nto keep my prepared remarks brief, so that we’ll have plenty of time for your questions and\ncomments.\nAs you know, 2006 is a year of significant transition for the Federal Reserve. At the end\nof this month, Alan Greenspan is stepping down as Chairman after 18 years of distinguished\nservice, and Ben Bernanke will then, in all likelihood, have been confirmed by the Senate and\nwill therefore be in a position to become the new Chairman. So this seemed like a natural time\nto spend a few moments looking back at the Greenspan Fed and giving you some of my views on\nwhat may lie ahead under a “Bernanke Fed.”\nAlan Greenspan has won many plaudits for skillfully managing monetary policy—and\ndeservedly so. During the Greenspan years, the U.S. economy has been extraordinarily stable,\nwith just two mild and short recessions, and with low and stable inflation for over a decade.\nClearly, in the short time I have today, I cannot do justice to all the accomplishments,\ninnovations, and successes the Fed has achieved under his leadership. So I’ll focus on two\naspects of policy that I believe have been especially important to this sterling record—a\nsystematic, and therefore understandable and predictable approach to policy, and a growing\nemphasis on communication and transparency.\nI will focus first on what I mean by a systematic approach to policy. While the Fed does\nnot follow a policy rule, it has been consistent in its approach to achieving its dual mandate—\n1\n\nkeeping inflation low and stable and promoting maximum sustainable employment. For\nexample, when faced with an unwelcome increase in inflation, the Fed has consistently\nengineered a strong funds rate response. Indeed, at times, the Fed has taken preemptive\nmeasures, shooting inflation before it “sees the whites of its eyes;” for example, in 1994, it raised\nthe funds rate aggressively in response to indicators suggesting that demand had exceeded\ncapacity in labor and product markets, even though inflation itself had not shown much of a rise.\nLikewise, when faced with an unemployment rate that diverges from our best estimates of so-\ncalled “full” employment, the Fed’s response also has been consistent and strong. Consider the\nstart of the 1990s, when the unemployment rate was rising—even though inflation was some\ndistance from price stability, the Fed chose to ease policy.\nThis systematic, consistent approach has enhanced the ability of financial markets to\nanticipate the Fed’s response to economic developments and to respond themselves in advance\nof the Fed. Such market responses strengthen and speed the transmission of policy to the\neconomy and conceivably enhance economic stability. Moreover, a systematic, consistent\napproach helps build the public’s confidence in the Fed’s commitment to low and stable\ninflation; this confidence, in turn, may well make it easier for the Fed to respond to fluctuations\nin labor and product markets, because there is less risk that an easing of policy will unleash a\nwave of inflation fears.\nAs successful as this systematic approach has been, I should note that it has by no means\nbeen a straitjacket for policy during the Greenspan years. Rather, policy also has been flexible\nwhen unusual circumstances called for it. Let me give just one example. In the latter part of the\n1990s, the Greenspan Fed—and Greenspan in particular—was quick to spot the productivity\nsurge and to realize that it meant that the unemployment rate could be significantly lower than\n2\n\npreviously thought, for a time, at least, without igniting inflation. This led to a policy of\n“forbearance,” capturing the benefits of lower unemployment while continuing to move toward\nprice stability.\nNow let me turn to the second aspect of policy, namely, the increased emphasis on\ncommunication and transparency. One of the first steps in this direction occurred in 1994, when\nthe FOMC began issuing press releases after its meetings that explicitly announced changes in\nthe federal funds rate target. Over the decade or so since then, the press release has come to\ninclude a statement about the balance of risks to the attainment of its dual mandate, and at least\nsome indication of where policy may go in the future. This enhanced transparency works in\ntandem with the systematic approach I discussed, because it, too, helps the markets anticipate the\nFed’s response to economic developments.\nA good example of this was the threat of outright deflation in 2003. The FOMC wanted\npolicy to err on the side of accommodation until the threat had passed. With Japan’s unfortunate\nexperience in the 1990s as a clear object lesson, the Committee believed that the costs of slipping\ninto deflation would be worse than the costs of a bit of over-stimulation to economic activity.\nThis risk management approach to policy was communicated to the public when the FOMC\nstatement said, “In these circumstances, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can\nbe maintained for a considerable period.” This forward-looking language itself seems to have\nhelped keep long-term interest rates low, thereby minimizing the risk of deflation.\nOf course, there have certainly been other developments in policy during the 18 years of\nGreenspan’s chairmanship that have contributed to its success in achieving its dual mandate. But\nI believe these two—a systematic approach to policy and more communication and\n3\n\ntransparency—are particularly noteworthy. They have helped strengthen public confidence in\nthe Fed and thereby helped anchor inflation expectations to price stability.\nThese achievements provide a great foundation for the new Chairman, Ben Bernanke.\nHaving observed him when he was a member of the Board of Governors from 2002 to 2005, and\nbeing familiar with his remarkable body of research on macroeconomic policy, I feel pretty\nconfident that he places an equally high value on a systematic approach as well as on\ntransparency and communication. Indeed, he has stressed that clear communications about the\ncentral bank's approach, its objectives, and its assessment of the economy are necessary to reduce\nuncertainty and stabilize expectations. And any of you who have read the speeches he gave while\nhe was a Governor will know that he is a consummate communicator and teacher.\nOne area where he has differed with Chairman Greenspan is on how to define “price\nstability.” Of course, both see price stability as a prime objective of policy. But for Chairman\nGreenspan, the definition has been behavioral—that is, he would say that we have achieved price\nstability when inflation is low enough that it does not affect people’s economic decisions. In\ncontrast, well before Bernanke was nominated to be Fed Chairman, he said that he would like to\nsee the establishment of a numerical objective for price stability. If you’re interested in getting a\nfull articulation of his views, I’d recommend you take a look at a speech he gave in October\n2003 at a conference at the St. Louis Fed.1 Since his nomination, he has said that he would not\ninstitute such an approach without a consensus among FOMC members.\nFor my part, I’m sympathetic to the idea of a quantitative objective for price stability, as I\nagree that it enhances both Fed transparency and accountability. I have previously articulated\nmy views on this. I see an inflation rate between 1 and 2 percent, as measured by the core\n1 Remarks by Governor Ben S. Bernanke at the 28th Annual Policy Conference: Inflation Targeting: Prospects and\nProblems, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri, October 17, 2003.\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2003/20031017/default.htm\n4\n\npersonal consumption expenditures price index, as an appropriate price stability objective for the\nFed. However, I also think it is critically important that a numerical inflation objective not\nweaken our commitment to a dual mandate that includes full employment. Therefore, I would\nsee the numerical objective as a long-run goal, and would want the Committee to have a flexible\ntimeframe within which to maintain it. We’ve done a good job under Chairman Greenspan of\npromoting both price stability and full employment. I believe that a numerical long-run\nobjective for inflation will enhance our ability to maintain that success even in the face of the\nsignificant challenges that may come up.\nLet me wrap things up by saying that I hope these brief remarks have given you some\nappreciation of the remarkable achievements of the Greenspan Fed over nearly two decades and\na glimpse into some issues that may arise in the “Bernanke Fed.” As a member of the FOMC, of\ncourse, I am going to be “at the table,” and in the thick of the transition. It particularly pleases\nme to say that, with the Fed’s increased emphasis on communication and transparency, you and\nthe rest of the public are going to have a pretty good view of how things play out yourselves. So\nstay tuned—I think it’s going to be a fascinating year for us all!\n# # #\n5",

    "text": "Speech to the Silicon Valley Leadership Group\nSanta Clara, California\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery February 21, 2007, 12:25 PM Pacific, 3:25 PM Eastern\nThe U.S. Economy in 2007\nGood afternoon, everyone. It’s a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak to the Silicon\nValley Leadership Group today. I owe a debt of gratitude to Ken Wilcox for facilitating\nthe invitation. As you may know, Ken serves on the San Francisco Fed’s Head Office\nBoard of Directors, having recently been elected to a second term. He and the other\nDirectors, not only at the Head Office, but also at our Branch offices, play an important\nrole in the formulation of monetary policy. Of course, the emphasis of our policy\nanalysis and our policy decisions must be on what serves the best interests of the nation\nas a whole. But the Directors’ independent assessment of conditions in specific regions\nand specific industries often gives us insights into developing trends that the national data\nmay not reflect for weeks or months. Our Directors also play a key role in\ncommunicating with the public about the Fed and its mission—and that includes hearing\nthe public’s views on the economy and bringing that information back to the Boardroom.\nThis kind of give-and-take with the public is a high priority for me, as well, so I am\nlooking forward very much to hearing your comments and observations during the\nquestion and answer session.\nMy remarks today will center on recent developments affecting the U.S. economy and\nwhat they may portend for the future and especially for the conduct of monetary policy. I\nwill spend some time focusing on housing markets, since they may play a key role in\ndetermining which direction economic activity and inflation will head over the rest of this\nyear. Before I begin, let me note that my comments represent my own views and not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nAs you no doubt remember, the Federal Open Market Committee began to remove\nmonetary stimulus in mid-2004, after a long stretch of keeping the federal funds rate—\nour main policy tool—at a very low level. Altogether, there were 17 consecutive quarter-\npoint increases in the funds rate over about two years. During much of that time, the\neconomy averaged solid growth, absorbing a good deal of the slack in labor and product\nmarkets. The object of the policy tightening was to slow the economy’s growth to a more\nsustainable pace and to foster a gradual decline in inflation, promoting price stability. In\nAugust of last year, the Committee voted to “pause,” that is, not to raise the funds rate\nanother quarter point, but to leave it at 5¼ percent. By then, some of the effects of the\nearlier increases were being felt, as the economy showed signs of slowing, and this gave\nsome sense of reassurance that inflation was likely to moderate from an elevated level.\nThese moves held the promise of setting the economy on a glide path for the proverbial\n“soft landing”—an orderly slowing of growth that avoids the risk of a severe downturn\n\nwhile producing enough slack in labor and goods markets to relieve inflationary pressures\nand, indeed, to bring inflation down gradually to a more acceptable level than it has\nregistered over the prior year or so.\nIn large measure, the economy has moved within range of this outcome. And at the last\nmeeting of the Committee, the members voted to keep the funds rate at 5¼ percent. But\nas always, there are risks to this forecast that need to be watched closely. At this stage,\nthe predominant risks center on whether inflation will continue to move down gradually.\nThis concern was expressed in the statement following our last meeting, and I’d like to\nelaborate on that point in the remainder of my remarks.\nLet me begin with where inflation is right now. Based on our main measure—the price\nindex for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, or the core PCE\nprice index—consumer inflation was 2.2 percent over the past year, which, as I indicated,\nis higher than I would like to see. However, it is encouraging that we have seen some\neasing recently: in the last three months, this index has registered a more acceptable 1.7\npercent annual rate of increase. The core CPI, which came out this morning, was on the\nhigh side of expectations in January. However, this followed three straight months of\nlow core CPI inflation; after smoothing through the volatility, this measure of inflation\nalso has eased in recent months.\nOne explanation for this decline in inflation involves the impact of stabilizing, and now\nfalling, oil prices. As I mentioned, core inflation, by definition, excludes energy prices,\nbut they still may affect core inflation to the extent that they affect the prices of other\ngoods and services. For example, transport companies might raise their prices to pass\nalong the higher costs of filling their trucks' gas tanks. This is known as \"pass-through,\"\nand it is likely that it has played at least some role in recent movements in core inflation.\nNow that oil prices have fallen a fair bit from recent highs and are expected by futures\nmarkets to remain at those lower levels, this upward pressure on core inflation is likely to\ndissipate and may even be turning into modest downward pressure. However, it’s\nimportant to remember that the effects of oil price changes on inflation are by their very\nnature temporary. So at some point, the fall in oil prices will no longer have a favorable\neffect. Abnormally rapid rent increases, likely reflecting an increase in the demand for\nrental units by would-be owners who have been priced out of the housing market, have\nalso elevated core inflation over the past year. As the housing market adjusts over time,\nhowever, this source of inflationary pressure is also apt to dissipate.\nBeyond these temporary effects, the stability of inflation expectations is another reason to\ntake a positive view and project a gradual diminution of inflation. Expected future\ninflation is one of the factors that businesses consider in setting their prices and that\nworkers consider when they bargain for compensation. These expectations appear to\nhave been well anchored over the past ten years or so as the Fed has established its\ncredibility with the public about both its commitment to and its competence in keeping\ninflation at low and stable rates. One piece of evidence supporting this credibility is that,\n\nin the face of the recent large oil price increases, we’ve seen stability in survey and\nmarket measures of inflation expectations looking ten years ahead.1\nBy now you are probably asking yourselves, if the inflation rate has been falling and if\ninflation expectations are well anchored, why the concern about risks to the forecast of\ngradually lower inflation? Part of the answer is to be found in the strength of labor\nmarkets. The latest data show payroll employment growing at a rather robust pace for all\nof last year. Moreover, the unemployment rate has declined by half a percentage point\nover the past year and now stands at just over 4½ percent; that rate suggests a degree of\ntightness in the labor market, because it is somewhat below common estimates of the rate\nthat can be sustained in the long run without generating rising inflation.\nI say “suggests” a degree of tightening in labor markets because there is uncertainty about\nit. For example, if labor markets are tight, one would expect that labor compensation—\nincluding both wages and benefits—would be rising rapidly. However, the available\ninformation on this provides a mixed picture. We have two broad measures of labor\ncompensation. One, the employment cost index, is showing remarkably restrained\nincreases of only 3¼ percent over the past year, up only slightly from the prior year, and\nthis development would seem to belie tight labor markets. The other measure,\ncompensation per hour, gives a higher reading of about 5 percent. However, this measure\nincludes compensation methods like stock options that are more akin to profits than\nwages. So part of the strength in this measure may not actually indicate a tight labor\nmarket.\nStill, given the probability of some tightness, we would need to see real GDP growth\nremain moderately below its long-run trend for a time to have confidence that the\neconomy is heading for a soft landing with inflation continuing to move lower. The\nimpetus for the needed moderate growth is likely already in train, given the cumulative\neffects of the 17 stepwise increases in the funds rate that began a couple of years ago.\nSince then, short- and intermediate-term interest rates have risen substantially. For\nexample, Treasury bill rates are up by more than 3½ percentage points from mid-2004.\nIt’s true that corporate long-term rates are actually down by around ½ percentage point\nover this period, while conventional fixed mortgage rates are essentially unchanged.\nHowever, variable mortgage rates have risen along with short-term rates. The overall\neffect of such rate changes has been to reduce demand. Not surprisingly, the housing\nsector has been at the leading edge of the overall economic slowdown, and I’d like to turn\nmy attention to that important sector now.\nNationally, growth in spending on residential structures—after adjusting for inflation—\nwas quite strong during 2002 through 2005. The decline started toward the end of 2005\n1 See Bharat Trehan and Jason Tjosvold, “Inflation Targets and Inflation Expectations: Some Evidence\nfrom the Recent Oil Shocks,” FRBSF Economic Letter, 2006-22, September 1, 2006. For a discussion of\nrelated issues, see John Williams, “Inflation in an Era of Well-Anchored Inflation Expectations,” FRBSF\nEconomic Letter, 2006-27, October 13, 2006.\n\nand residential investment has fallen—in absolute terms—by a total of 13 percent, with\nespecially steep drops over the last two quarters. In fact, during both of those quarters,\nthis sector alone—which represents only a small fraction of U.S. real GDP—subtracted a\nhefty 1¼ percentage points from real GDP growth. Housing starts have followed a\nsimilar pattern, reaching a peak in January 2006 and then falling by roughly 40 percent\nthrough January of this year. That, of course, includes the headline-grabbing plunge for\nJanuary announced last week.\nDespite the continued weakness in housing construction, which as I said enters directly\ninto the calculation of real GDP, there are some signs of stabilization in other aspects of\nhousing markets, suggesting that construction activity may level out before too long. For\nexample, home sales have steadied somewhat after falling sharply for a year or so.\nConsidering this in combination with the continued drop in housing starts that I\nmentioned earlier, it is not surprising to find that inventories of unsold homes have begun\nto shrink. This development suggests that the process of resolving the imbalances\nbetween demand and supply in the housing market may be underway, and, as a result, we\ncould very well see the drag on real GDP from housing construction wane later this year.\nOf course, such a turn of events is by no means a given, because the improvements we’ve\nseen may just be temporary. For example, it is possible that they were related to a\ndecline in fixed mortgage rates since the middle of last year, a development that probably\nsupported home sales, at least to some extent. However, the decline in mortgage rates\ncame as a bit of a surprise to me in a period when the FOMC maintained the funds rate\ntarget at 5¼ percent, especially in view of the widely discussed “conundrum” about why\nlong-term interest rates were already so low.2 Therefore, we can’t count on further\ndeclines in mortgage rates to bring the housing market back.\nIn addition to concerns about weakness in housing construction, there has been worry that\ndifficulties related to housing markets could spread to consumer spending more\ngenerally. Since consumption expenditures represent two-thirds of real GDP, even a\nrelatively modest impact from housing markets on this big sector could put a noticeable\ndent in overall economic activity.\nUp to this point, we haven’t seen signs of such spillovers. Consumption spending has\nbeen well maintained, showing a robust growth rate for all of 2006. However, going\nforward, there are at least a couple of ways that spillovers from weakness in housing\ncould depress consumer spending, and these channels bear watching. First, housing\nmakes up a significant fraction of many people’s wealth, so a significant change in house\nvalues can affect consumer wealth and therefore consumer spending. As you know, there\nhave been fears about plummeting house prices. But so far, at least, house prices at the\n2 See Tao Wu, “The Long-Term Interest Rate Conundrum: Not Unraveled Yet?” FRBSF Economic Letter,\n2005-08, April 29, 2005, and Glenn Rudebusch, Eric Swanson, and Tao Wu (2006), “The Bond Yield\n‘Conundrum’ from a Macro-Finance Perspective,” Monetary and Economic Studies 24 (S-1), 83-128.\n\nnational level either have continued to appreciate, though at a much more moderate rate,\nor have fallen moderately, depending on the price index you look at. Looking ahead,\nfutures markets are expecting small declines in a number of metropolitan areas this year.\nWhile these modest movements are undoubtedly imparting less impetus to consumer\nspending now than during the years of rapid run-ups, their effects are not likely to be\ndramatic.\nAs a homeowner in the Bay Area myself, I’ve naturally taken a close look at the housing\nmarket here, so let me digress a moment to give you my reading on the situation. In the\nfourth quarter, sales of existing homes were down about 15 to 20 percent, and after\nseveral years of rapid appreciation, house prices barely budged in 2006. Builders\nresponded to the demand slowdown accordingly, pulling fewer permits for new homes\nlast year. However, here in Silicon Valley, some encouraging evidence of stabilization in\nthe rate of homebuilding emerged late in the year.\nI mentioned fears about plummeting house prices, and in this area, you don’t need a long\nmemory to understand why people have harbored them. In the first half of the 1990s, area\nhome prices fell more than 10 percent. However, a key difference between then and now\nis the overall health of the local economy. For example, despite the slowdown in\nresidential construction activity, conditions on the nonresidential side have improved,\nhelping to keep overall Bay Area construction employment growing in 2006. And for\nemployment overall, the pace of growth actually picked up a bit last year. Continued\ngrowth of this sort should help the adjustment in local housing markets proceed in an\norderly fashion.\nReturning to the national economy, housing market developments also could spread to\nconsumer spending if enough homeowners experienced financial distress. For example,\nrising variable mortgage rates could strain some consumers’ cash flow. What we find,\nhowever, is that, because of the rapid appreciation of home prices in prior years, most\nhomeowners are sitting on a substantial amount of equity, a financial resource that they\ncan fall back on. In particular, adjustable-rate borrowers with equity can avoid a rate\nreset by refinancing. Moreover, only a small fraction of outstanding variable rate\nmortgages are scheduled to be reset in each of the next few years.\nOf course, financial distress could be a bigger problem for some borrowers who used so-\ncalled exotic financing—like interest-only loans, piggy-back loans, and loans with the\npossibility of negative amortization. These instruments are often designed to allow\nsubprime borrowers into the market. In fact, there are signs of trouble for some\nhouseholds. Delinquencies on variable-rate mortgages to subprime borrowers have risen\nsharply since the middle of last year and now exceed 10 percent. But fortunately,\ndelinquency rates for other types of mortgages—including all prime borrowers and even\nsubprime borrowers with fixed-rate loans—have edged up only very modestly. I know\nthat it’s common to see newspaper stories about homeowners who have run into trouble,\nand those situations are, indeed, regrettable. From a national perspective, however, the\n\ngroup with rising delinquencies still represents only a small fraction of the total market,\nwith little impact on the behavior of overall consumption.\nA forward-looking view of the credit risks associated with subprime mortgages can be\nobtained from a new financial instrument related to these mortgages.3 These instruments\nsuggest a big increase in the risk associated with loans made to the lowest-rated\nborrowers, but little change in risk for other higher-rated borrowers. Based on these\nresults, it appears that investors in these instruments expect the losses to be fairly well\ncontained. Of course, a shift in market sentiment about the risk of some of these\nsecurities is always possible. Such a shift would have ramifications for mortgage\nfinancing and housing, likely through tighter credit standards and higher mortgage rates\nfor certain borrowers. In fact, we already have seen some tightening among commercial\nbanks in recent months.4\nThe bottom line for housing is that the concerns we used to hear about the possibility of a\ndevastating collapse—one that might be big enough to cause a recession in the U.S.\neconomy—while not fully allayed have diminished. Moreover, while the future for\nhousing activity remains uncertain, I think there is a reasonable chance that housing is in\nthe process of stabilizing, which would mean that it would put a considerably smaller\ndrag on the economy going forward.\nIn addition to housing, weakness in auto production has slowed the economy during the\npast few quarters. The auto industry has felt the effects of high oil prices and people’s\ngrowing demand for more fuel-efficient vehicles. That has been good news for some of\nthe foreign automakers, but not such good news for U.S. automakers, for which SUVs\nand trucks have been a key source of strength. As the demand for these vehicles dropped,\nproducers found themselves holding unsustainably high inventories. It's little wonder\nthat they slashed production. These production cuts slowed overall real GDP growth in\nthe U.S. last year. However, once the adjustment to a lower level of production is\nreached, probably in the not too distant future, this factor will cease to hold down growth\nin the U.S. economy.\nOutside of housing and domestic autos, the rest of the economy has been doing quite\nwell; that’s why it might be called a “bi-modal” economy. I’ve already mentioned that\nconsumer spending has been robust. Business demand also has been solid, fueled by high\nprofits and relatively favorable financing conditions, leading to healthy growth in\nspending on business investment in structures as well as equipment and software.\nGrowth in investment in high-tech goods has been especially strong and the outlook is\nfavorable, as telecommunications companies expand their fiber-optics networks and\nbusinesses continue to improve their productivity by upgrading their IT equipment.\n3 Credit default swaps (CDS) on securities related to subprime mortgages.\n4 January 2007, Federal Reserve Board, Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey\n(http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/SnLoanSurvey/200701/default.htm).\n\nThis growing demand for high-tech products has especially important implications for\nSilicon Valley and the whole Bay Area. The IT sector accounts for about 20 percent of\ntotal salary payments in the Bay Area, which is more than twice the nationwide share.\nFollowing extensive retrenchment in the wake of the “tech wreck” in 2000, the Bay Area\nIT sector has rebounded smartly, with substantial gains in company earnings,\nemployment, and venture capital spending realized over the past year. This reflects not\nonly the success of local companies at capitalizing on growing worldwide demand for IT\nproducts, but also their talents for developing innovative new products that create sales\nopportunities. This success has been especially evident on the software and services side\nof the industry, where solid employment gains and rapid wealth creation have been\nprimary contributors to the area’s economic revitalization.\nFor the national economy, the net impact of both the weak and healthy sectors I’ve\ndescribed has produced moderate real GDP growth rates of 2½ and 2 percent in the\nsecond and third quarters of last year. The advance estimate of fourth-quarter growth\nshowed a surge to a strong 3½ percent rate. However, recent monthly data have been on\nthe weaker side. After smoothing out the volatility, my overall assessment is that\neconomic activity has proceeded at a moderate underlying pace for close to a year now.\nIn other words, it looks as if the economy is pretty close to the “glide path” I mentioned\nbefore—since the first quarter of last year, growth has slowed to a bit below most\nestimates of the economy’s long-run potential, and more recently the risk of an outright\ndownturn has receded along with the early signs of stabilization of housing markets. At\nthe same time, while core inflation remains on the high side of what I would like to see, it\nhas begun to ebb modestly in recent months.\nA key question for inflation going forward —and therefore, for monetary policy—is what\nhappens if the drag from housing and autos disappears later this year? As I’ve stressed,\nwith labor markets apparently somewhat tight, something else will need to slow to keep\ngrowth below potential.\nOne possibility is consumer spending. Growth in that sector seems likely to slow\nbecause of a diminishing impetus from household wealth, as house prices increase less\nrapidly and as past increases in interest rates impose a greater drag. In general, it\nwouldn’t be surprising to see a slowdown in consumer spending given that the personal\nsaving rate—the fraction of income not spent—has fallen to very low levels in recent\nyears and even into negative territory! There are good reasons for much of the drop in\nthe saving rate over the past decade, including the rapid growth in household wealth from\nhousing and the stock market. Given the extremely low recent level of saving, it\nwouldn’t be shocking to see some rebound in the saving rate. That said, the saving rate\nhas been falling for more than a decade, so it’s obviously risky to put too much reliance\non an upswing this year.\n\nIn summary, I believe that a soft landing is the most likely outcome over the next year or\ntwo. However, I hope my remarks so far make it abundantly clear that there are sizeable\nrisks to this forecast and that I am especially concerned about the upside risks to our\ninflation forecast.\nThese considerations play a key role in my views on monetary policy. I have supported\nthe decision to hold policy steady at the current rate despite inflation remaining higher\nthan I would like it to be. Let me be clear that I do want inflation to move down, but as I\njust indicated with my forecast, I believe policy may now be well-positioned to foster\nexactly such an outcome. Moreover, I continue to support the bias in policy toward\ntightening precisely because it gives due consideration to the upside risks to inflation.\nI’m casting my statements about the outlook in very conditional terms because of the\ngreat uncertainty that surrounds any economic forecast. This uncertainty argues for\npolicy to be responsive to the data as it emerges. The decision to keep policy on hold\nallows us more time to observe the data so that appropriate adjustments can be made to\nachieve our goals of maximum stainable employment and price stability.\n# # #",

    "text": "Presentation to the Oregon Bankers Association Annual Convention with\nthe Idaho Bankers Association\nCoeur d’Alene, Idaho\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on Tuesday, July 28, 2009, 9:35 AM Pacific time, 12:35 PM Eastern\nThe Outlook for the U.S. Economy and Community Banks1\nF\nThank you very much. I’m delighted to be able to talk to an audience of community\nbankers in such a beautiful setting. The 12th Federal Reserve District stretches from Utah to\nHawaii, and from Arizona to Alaska. As I travel around this region, I often think how lucky I am\nto be able to visit some of the most breathtaking places in the United States. Coeur d’Alene is\nclearly among them.\nI will speak today about the difficult economic landscape lying before us and what that\nmeans for community banks. It’s fair to say that you have been caught in a financial and\neconomic crisis that you did not create, one precipitated in part by exotic financial engineering\ncarried out mainly by large financial institutions, not banks like yours. Community banks\ngenerally steered clear of the market for credit default swaps and didn’t create structured\ninvestment vehicles to keep assets off of balance sheets. Now though all of us must live with the\nconsequences of the culture of risk that permeated the global financial system. The near collapse\nof that system and the severe recession that continues today have created an exceptionally\nstressful environment even for well-run banks. That leaves little choice except to take the proper\nsteps to manage through this storm, a point I will expand on later in my talk.\n1 I would like to thank Teresa Curran, John Judd, Maureen O’Byrne, and Sam Zuckerman for assistance in preparing\nthese remarks.\n\nI’ll start my remarks by giving you my perspective on the current economic landscape\nand prospects for recovery. I will then offer some thoughts about inflation, a subject I know\nconcerns many of you. And I will finish by reviewing the situation faced by community banks in\nthe Pacific Northwest and the 12th District as a whole. As always, my comments represent my\nown views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nEconomic and financial conditions\nIt was less than a year ago that the financial system found itself on the very brink of\ncollapse. As home prices tumbled, loan losses cascaded through our financial system. These\nlosses started in subprime markets but spread broadly across nearly all sectors, exposing\nweaknesses in market structures and the practices of many financial institutions. When Lehman\nBrothers failed in September 2008, vital wholesale funding markets seized up, precipitating the\nmost catastrophic liquidity crisis since the 1930s. Only the most aggressive intervention by\ngovernments and central banks around the world prevented outright financial meltdown. Some\npeople grumble about programs such as TARP, TAF, TALF, and the rest of the alphabet soup.\nBut it’s important to remember how close we were to something unimaginable. Those initiatives\nmay not have been perfect, but I believe they succeeded in supporting the system until a measure\nof confidence returned.\nFinancial trauma of this magnitude could have nothing but the direst effects on economic\nactivity. As we all know, the financial earthquake of the summer and fall was quickly followed\nby aftershocks that rocked the broader economy, intensifying a credit crunch, and producing\nprecipitous drops in employment and economic output. The interaction between the economy\n2\n\nand the credit crunch—often described as an adverse feedback loop—led to what could become\nthe most severe recession since the Great Depression.\nThat’s the backdrop to our current situation. And here the picture turns brighter, as we\nglimpse the first solid signs since the recession started more than a year and a half ago that\neconomic growth may be poised to resume. Indeed, I expect that to happen sometime this year.\nFinancial conditions have improved markedly in recent months. The stock market has rallied\nand investor appetite for corporate bonds and other assets has rebounded, restoring access to\ncapital at reasonable rates for many healthy companies, including financial institutions.\nMeasures of stress in the markets for short-term funding have also diminished. At the same time,\nthe housing sector finally seems to be stabilizing. Housing starts have leveled off and, in an\nencouraging sign, sales are beginning to improve. Meanwhile, house price declines may finally\nbe abating. Consumer spending may also be stabilizing. Payrolls are still shrinking at a dreadful\npace, but at least the momentum of job losses has slowed a bit in the past two months.\nOregon and Idaho have been hit hard by the recession, with unemployment rising in both\nstates at a faster pace than in the nation as a whole.2 Both Oregon and Idaho have large\nF F\nproportions of technology manufacturing jobs, which have been vulnerable to the sharp\ndownturn in that sector. And Oregon is highly dependent on international trade,3 which has\nF F\nexperienced a historic contraction. Oregon’s unemployment rate was 12.2 percent in June, the\nthird highest in the nation.\n2 Oregon’s unemployment rate has risen from a low of 5 percent in April 2007 to 12.2 percent in June 2009, an\nincrease of 7.2 percentage points. Idaho’s rate has jumped from 2.8 percent in May 2007 to 8.4 percent in June 2009,\nan increase of 5.6 percentage points. By comparison, the U.S. unemployment rate went from 4.4 percent in March\n2007 to 9.5 percent in the latest period, an increase of 5.1 percentage points.\n3 The value of merchandise exports as a share of gross state product was 12 percent in Oregon in 2008. For the\nUnited States, the comparable percentage was 9.1 percent.\n3\n\nLooking ahead at the national economy, a variety of sources will fuel growth in the\nmonths ahead, including expansionary fiscal and monetary policies, and the normal dynamics of\nthe business cycle. The fiscal stimulus program passed by Congress in February provides tax\ncuts that have raised household income. In addition, government spending is directly adding to\npayrolls and boosting demand. More stimulus will come on line as the year proceeds. This\nprogram wasn’t designed to produce an economic recovery by itself, but rather to cushion our\nfall. In that sense, it’s doing its job.\nMonetary policy too has contributed to recovery. As you know, the Fed is using both\ntraditional and nontraditional tools to boost the economy. We have set our federal funds rate\ntarget close to zero and indicated that economic conditions are likely to warrant keeping it there\nfor an “extended period.” We have provided liquidity to previously dysfunctional markets, such\nas the asset-backed commercial paper market. And we’ve purchased Treasury and agency-\nrelated securities for our own portfolio to help push longer-term private borrowing costs lower,\nthereby stimulating demand.\nMeanwhile, the normal dynamics of the business cycle are turning more favorable. Some\nsectors are poised to rebound simply because they have sunk so low. For example, the auto\nindustry has cut production so far that inventories have begun to shrink, even in the face of\nhistorically weak demand. Just slowing the pace of inventory liquidation will bolster economic\nactivity. This story holds for many sectors of the economy where spikes in inventories occurred\nas cautious consumers cut back on purchases of durable goods, and businesses slashed spending\non equipment and software. Looking forward, the demand for houses and durables should also\neventually revive as old and broken-down goods need to be replaced. The resulting demand will\nhelp the economy recover.\n4\n\nBut that recovery is likely to be painfully slow. History teaches that it often takes a long\nwhile to recover from downturns caused by financial crises.4 Financial institutions and markets\nF F\nwon’t heal overnight. And it will take quite some time before households have repaired their\ntattered finances. Until recently, households were saving less and borrowing more in response to\nwealth gains in both stocks and housing. This pattern made their balance sheets vulnerable to\nadverse developments and the crashes in both house and stock prices during the last two years\ndestroyed trillions of dollars of their wealth. Not surprisingly, the personal saving rate has now\nshot higher and I expect to see subdued consumer spending for some time.5 The unprecedented\nF F\nglobal nature of the recession also will act as a drag.6 Countries recovering from financial crises\nF F\noften receive a boost from foreign demand, but neither the United States nor its trading partners\ncan count on such external stimulus this time.\nA gradual recovery means that things won’t feel very good for some time to come. The\nunemployment rate currently is 9½ percent, and this figure is likely to rise further. Moreover,\neven after the economy begins to grow, it could still take several years to return to full\nemployment. The same is true for capacity utilization in manufacturing, which has declined so\nfar that it has fallen “off the charts”—now standing at its lowest level in the postwar period.\nFinally, even though downside risks to the outlook have diminished, there remains some\nchance that economic conditions could turn out worse than what I’ve sketched. High on my\nworry list is the possibility of another shock to the still-fragile financial system. Commercial real\nestate is a particular danger zone, but I will hold my discussion of that topic until I turn to\nbanking conditions.\n4 Reinhart and Rogoff (2009).\n5 Glick and Lansing (2009).\n6 International Monetary Fund (2009).\n5\n\nLet me now address another issue that is garnering attention—inflation. This is a subject\nrife with contradiction. Almost without exception, my business contacts report downward\npressure on wages and prices. At the same time, they tell me they worry that the United States is\non the threshold of serious inflation. They see large federal budget deficits today and more\nlooming on the horizon. They also note that the Fed has pumped up bank reserves and expanded\nits balance sheet to fund its financial support programs. They worry that this may amount to\nfinancing deficits with money creation. Surely, they say, these things will eventually have to\nlead to higher inflation.\nI’ll begin with budget deficits. The gap in the federal budget for the current and the next\nfiscal years are projected to exceed $1 trillion, far larger than anything we’ve ever seen before.\nBut a large part of these current deficits are temporary. A portion stems from the impact of the\nweak economy on the budget. In a recession, tax collections fall and spending on programs such\nas unemployment insurance rise automatically. A significant portion is due to the fiscal stimulus\nthat has been put in place over the next few years to address the recession. Antirecessionary\nfiscal policy, in my view, is entirely appropriate. Since that stimulus is temporary by design, the\nresulting deficits will shrink as the stimulus phases out. But federal deficits will not disappear\ncompletely even when the economy has recovered and the stimulus program has phased out. On\nthe contrary, these ongoing or “structural” deficits are anticipated to stretch indefinitely into the\nfuture and to escalate over time in a manner that ultimately is not sustainable. The long-term\nprojected structural budget deficit mainly reflects the impact of an aging population and rapidly\nrising health-care costs on spending for federal entitlement programs, particularly Medicare and\nMedicaid.\n6\n\nEconomists have known, worried, and warned the public about the damaging\nconsequences of escalating long-term budget deficits in the United States for decades. It’s high\ntime for our country to tackle the problem head-on. But the main concern with these deficits\nrelates to productivity and living standards, and not high inflation. Large budget deficits do not\ncause high inflation automatically. In fact, since World War II, large deficits have been\nassociated with high inflation only in developing countries. That’s because developing countries\noften have central banks that are under the sway of the government, which sometimes induces\nthem to print money to finance government spending.7 The connection isn’t found in countries\nF F\nsuch as ours with advanced financial systems and independent central banks. Remember that, in\nthe 1980s, the United States ran large deficits just as inflation was coming down. And Japan has\nhad huge deficits through much of the past two decades, yet its problem is persistent deflation—\nprecisely the opposite of inflation. The United States and most other industrialized countries\nhave central banks with long traditions of independence and deep-seated support for keeping\npolitics out of monetary policy. In those countries, the monetary authorities generally have stuck\nto their inflation objectives, even when governments ran large budget deficits.\nIn advanced countries, the problem isn’t that large deficits cause inflation. Rather it’s\nthat they raise long-term interest rates, thereby crowding out private investment, which holds\nback advances in productivity and living standards. Right now, private investment spending is\nextremely weak, so financing for the large federal deficits is readily available. But once private\nspending recovers, the competition for funds between the government and private sectors could\ndrive interest rates up. A decline in productivity growth is a serious problem—one we should\nstrive to avoid—but it is not the same as inflation.\n7 Fischer et al. (2002) and Catao and Terrones (2005).\n7\n\nSo what about the Fed’s unprecedented balance sheet expansion? Our strong steps to\navert financial and economic meltdown have caused our assets to more than double, from under\n$900 billion at the start of the recession to over $2 trillion now. This expansion is largely\nfinanced by increases in excess reserves that banks deposit with us.\nNow we come to the crux of the issue: Will this expansion of credit and bank reserves\ncreate high inflation? My answer is no. And the reason again is because of current economic\nconditions. Monetary policy fosters inflation when it loosens the stance of policy enough to\ncreate excess demand for goods and services. Right now, we have exactly the opposite—an\nexcess supply of goods and services. We need more demand—not less—to offset slack in labor\nand product markets. We have seen a noticeable slowdown in wage growth and reports of wage\ncuts have become increasingly prevalent. Businesses are cutting prices to boost sales. As a\nresult, core inflation—a measure that excludes volatile food and energy prices—has drifted\nbelow 2 percent, a level that I and most of my colleagues consider consistent with price stability.\nWith unemployment already substantial and likely to rise further, and industrial capacity\nutilization at record low levels, downward pressure on wages and prices isn’t likely to go away\nsoon. I expect core inflation to remain below 2 percent for several more years.\nOf course, the economy will eventually recover and we will need to withdraw monetary\naccommodation. If we were to fail to do so, we would indeed have higher inflation. The Fed is\nkeenly aware of this. We have the tools to tighten policy when the time is right and we have the\nwill to use them. First, many of our emergency programs are already tapering off as market\nconditions improve. Second, many of the assets that we have accumulated during the crisis—\nsuch as Treasury and mortgage-backed agency securities—have ready markets and can be easily\nsold. Finally, the Fed can push up the federal funds rate and tighten policy by raising the rate of\n8\n\ninterest paid to banks on the reserves they deposit with us—authority granted by Congress last\nyear. An increase in the interest rate on reserves will induce banks to lend money to us rather\nthan to other banks, thereby pushing up rates in the interbank market and, by extension, other\ninterest rates throughout the economy. This is an important tool because, even if the economy\nrebounds nicely, the credit crunch might not be fully behind us and some financial markets might\nstill need Fed support. This tool will enable us to tighten credit conditions even if we maintain a\nlarge balance sheet for a time. The experience of central banks in Europe, Japan, and Canada\nsuggests that this approach can be effective.8\nF\nLet me be clear: In our conduct of monetary policy, we are guided by our statutory\nmandates of maximum employment and price stability. We are committed to doing everything\nin our power to foster both goals. Our institution was created as a politically independent central\nbank, and that tradition is deeply embedded in our culture and practice. When the economy does\ncome back, I can assure you that we will act decisively and appropriately to tighten the stance of\npolicy and maintain price stability.\nBanking\nLet me shift now to a review of banking conditions. As I noted earlier, when the\nfinancial crisis intensified last fall, the Fed worked jointly with Treasury and other regulators to\nstabilize the banking system and restore confidence in financial markets more broadly.\nThe Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, injected capital into the banking system at\na time when confidence in the system’s soundness was eroding and private funding was\nunavailable. I believe that it made a positive contribution. One indication of the significance of\n8 Bernanke (2009a).\n9\n\nTARP capital for community banks in the West is that about one in five banks in the 12th Federal\nReserve District took advantage of the program. Participating banks augmented their capital by\nan average of 2 percentage points. I certainly recognize that some bankers don’t like the\n“strings” attached to TARP and perceive that the goals of the program have shifted over time.\nBut there’s no denying that the program measurably strengthened the capitalization of many\ncommunity banks, putting them in a stronger position to weather difficult times. The stability of\nbank funding has also been bolstered by the FDIC’s temporary liquidity guarantee program and\nthe expansion of deposit insurance limits. Another program that should be helpful to banks is the\njoint Fed-Treasury initiative known as the Term Asset-Backed Securities Lending Facility, or\nTALF. This initiative is designed to revive critical securitization markets and help boost the\nissuance of a wide range of securitized loan products. The Fed’s recent expansion of the\nprogram to include both legacy and new commercial mortgage-backed securities should enhance\nthe availability of credit for commercial real estate and benefit both large and small banks with\nsignificant exposure to this sector by preventing defaults and facilitating the sale of distressed\nproperties.\nAll in all, I believe that the aggressive responses of the Fed and other agencies served to\nease the funding pressures facing a broad range of banks and to stabilize the financial system.\nThe restoration of confidence in the financial system has benefited all banks.\nOf course, the crisis has made it self-evident that we must reform our regulatory\nframework and improve supervisory practice so that a catastrophe of this magnitude never\nhappens again. As you know, the Obama administration has submitted a comprehensive reform\nbill to Congress, which is holding hearings over the summer on the proposal. Last week,\nChairman Bernanke and Governor Tarullo testified before Congress, laying out the Fed’s views\n10\n\non regulatory restructuring.9 Let me mention just two key areas where our regulatory framework\nF F\nmust be strengthened.\nFirst, we need a better way to manage systemic risk. By that I mean improved oversight\nof the financial system as a whole. Focusing on systemic risk is different than our traditional\ninstitution-oriented approach to supervision. It has become painfully clear that when regulators\nfocus exclusively on individual institutions, they can miss broader risks building in the system.\nIn particular, we need to do a better job of assessing how the practices of large institutions may\naffect their counterparties and the system as a whole. I know that many community bankers\nconsider it unfair that small banks—which did not cause the financial mess—are allowed to fail,\nwhile larger banks that took the biggest risks are rescued. That’s an understandable reaction.\nBut we can’t escape the reality that certain institutions, by virtue of their size or their linkages to\nkey markets, pose unique risks to the system and can bring others down with them. One lesson\nfrom the crisis is that it’s dangerous to have large, systemic institutions operating outside the\nregulatory framework or with inadequate capital and liquidity buffers. It’s essential that we\nidentify these systemic institutions and subject them to a robust framework of consolidated\nsupervision as well as more stringent standards for capital, liquidity, and governance.\nProtecting consumers is a second area where our current system failed in many respects.\nThis is not only a matter of fairness for individuals. It’s also a key element in the performance of\nour economy. Abuses such as inadequate consumer disclosures and unfair and deceptive\nmortgage lending practices by some institutions contributed to record foreclosure rates that\nmagnified the financial crisis. Given what we’ve learned about the pernicious effects of\n9 Tarullo (2009) and Bernanke (2009b).\n11\n\nconsumer loan defaults on the banking sector and the economy, it’s critical that we strengthen\nour regulation and supervision in this area for both bank and nonbank financial players.\nNow let me turn to the business environment facing banks. The industry is going through\none of the most difficult periods in modern times. First-quarter data show that the 12th District\nhas been hit harder than any other area of the country. Bank profits are down, loan delinquencies\nare up, and failures are climbing.\nIn Oregon and Idaho, community banks are underperforming the nation and have\nsignificantly riskier profiles. In terms of return on assets, Oregon was the eighth and Idaho was\nthe eleventh worst performing state in the nation.10 Moreover, a relatively large fraction of\nF F\nbanks in each state lost money in the first quarter—about 40 percent in Oregon and 20 percent in\nIdaho. Loan quality indicators tell a similar story. Recent net charge-off rates at banks in each\nstate are much higher than the national average. Recessionary effects normally take some time\nto work their way through loan portfolios. So, even though I expect economic growth to resume\nin the second half of this year, banking conditions are likely to remain quite weak for another\nyear or two.\nTo date, the community banks under greatest financial stress are those with high real\nestate concentrations in construction and land development lending. Banks that liberally funded\nspeculative housing and condominium construction, and those that funded land acquisition and\ndevelopment, have been hardest hit. Over 20 District financial institutions have failed since last\nyear. The vast majority of them had high concentrations in residential construction and\ndevelopment lending. In fact, these banks had construction loans that averaged about 40 percent\n10 These and other statistics on bank performance are from Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (2009).\n12\n\nof their loan portfolio, well above the District average of 16 percent. Unfortunately, some banks\nthat aggressively pursued these loans had weak appraisal and risk-monitoring systems.\nThe next area of significant vulnerability for the banking system, particularly for\ncommunity and regional banks with real estate concentrations, is income-producing office,\nwarehouse, and retail commercial property. Market fundamentals in most western states are\ndeteriorating. Vacancy rates are rising and rent pressures are hurting property cash flows.\nOffice vacancy rates in both Boise and Portland are expected to reach or exceed 20 percent over\nthe next year or two, the highest rates these cities have seen in many years. Retail shopping\ncenters are struggling with falling occupancy rates and pressures to grant rent concessions.\nProperty values are falling sharply across wide areas of the country, including the Pacific\nNorthwest. Some analysts forecast that commercial property values could experience falls\nsimilar to housing of 30 to 40 percent.\nRegrettably, a number of banks failed to implement risk management steps outlined in\nthe guidance on commercial real estate loan concentrations that was issued by regulators in 2006.\nBanks need to take proactive steps to address emerging credit problems, obtain new appraisals,\nand recognize impairment when warranted. But we also encourage banks to work out problem\nloans with troubled borrowers when this is prudent.\nOur biggest concern now is with maturing loans on depreciated commercial properties.\nIn many cases, borrowers seeking to refinance will be expected to provide additional equity and\nto have underwriting and pricing adjusted to reflect current market conditions. In some cases,\nborrowers won’t have the resources to refinance loans. TALF and the Treasury’s Public-Private\n13\n\nInvestment Program can support the commercial real estate market. But the economic forces\nhammering commercial property are unlikely to reverse anytime soon.\nAnother area I’d like to touch on is liquidity. For most banks, funding has stabilized\nsince last fall but remains quite fragile. We’ve seen rapid growth in the use of noncore funding\nchannels, such as brokered deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances. Brokered\ndeposits constitute an average of less than 4 percent of deposits nationally. But in Idaho, that\nconcentration is more than double. And, in Oregon, it’s more than three times higher.11\nF F\nAlthough many banks have managed their liquidity positions effectively, one lesson of the\ncurrent period is that funding options can evaporate when a bank is facing declining asset\nquality, diminished earnings capacity, and falling capital. And that holds for brokered deposits,\ncorrespondent lines, and FHLB advances.\nI know this sounds woeful, but my advice is to hope for the best and plan for the worst.\nThat means anticipating a range of bad and worst-case scenarios that reflect local economic\nconditions and a bank’s particular risk profile. It can be helpful to perform stress tests based on\nthese scenarios to assess potential effects on earnings and capital, and to develop appropriate\ncontingency plans. The commercial real estate guidance that I mentioned earlier emphasizes the\nimportance of stress tests. The testing that the largest 19 banks recently conducted offers\nexamples of techniques that community banks can adopt, such as two-year portfolio loss\nestimates and methods of estimating revenue. Appropriately designed stress tests can help bank\nmanagements and boards make decisions about loan-loss provisioning, capital planning, and\nstrategic initiatives.\n11 The Idaho concentration is 8 percent; Oregon is 13 percent.\n14\n\nIt also makes sense to perform liquidity risk analyses that assess potential funding\npressures. These analyses should include forward-looking metrics such as cash-flow projections,\nand should examine a range of possibilities, such as reduced correspondent borrowing lines,\nhigher FHLB haircuts, and loss of access to brokered deposits. Banks would be well advised to\nhave in place well-tested backup plans before any potential funding crisis, including procedures\nfor using the Fed’s discount window.\nOn the subject of capital, regulatory minimums are just that—minimums. They’re not\nguarantees that a bank will have enough capital to weather a future storm. The Fed and other\nregulators are placing much more emphasis on forward-looking capital analyses that consider a\nrange of difficult economic scenarios and include earnings and loss estimates, and assessments of\nan institution’s ability to raise private capital. Capital retention is an integral part of this\nequation, and that implies a rigorous review of dividend policy. I encourage bank managements\nto consult with their primary regulators about dividends in the context of capital planning\ndiscussions.\nAlthough my message is that you should plan for the worst and exercise caution, I want\nto stress that it is also critical that you continue to make loans to creditworthy borrowers. The\nprofits that quality loans generate will serve you well as you safeguard capital. They are the core\nearning assets that will power bank profitability as we head out of this recession. And, of course,\nthe credit provided by prudent, well-functioning depository institutions will play an important\nrole in supporting the broader economic recovery that now seems to be on the horizon. Thank\nyou very much.\n15\n\nReferences\nBernanke, Ben S. 2009a. “The Fed’s Exit Strategy.” The Wall Street Journal, Opinion, July 21.\nBernanke, Ben S. 2009b. “Regulatory Restructuring.” Testimony before the Committee on\nFinancial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, July 24.\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/bernanke20090724a.htm\nCatao, Luis A.V., and Marco E.

    "text": "Presentation to the University of California at Berkeley Boalt School Alumni\nSan Francisco, California\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery March 2, 2005, 6:05 PM Pacific Time, 9:05 PM Eastern\nProspects for the U.S. Economy\nGood evening, and thanks for the warm welcome. I’m delighted to be here. I\nplan to give you my thoughts on the prospects for the U.S. economy and the implications\nfor monetary policy. As always, my remarks reflect my own views, and not necessarily\nthose of others in the Federal Reserve.\nLet me start with a little background. When I set off to Washington a decade ago\nto become a Fed Governor, a friend gave me William Greider’s The Secrets of the Temple\nto read. He thought it would be good preparation. As the title of the book suggests, the\nFed was not considered an open, transparent or communicative institution. Indeed, most\ncentral banks for centuries had cultivated the image of being powerful and secretive.\nThe world has changed a lot since then. Several countries have now followed the\nlead of New Zealand which, in 1990, became the first country to adopt a strategy for\nconducting monetary policy known as inflation targeting. Inflation targeting is a highly\ntransparent regime in which a central bank publicly specifies a numerical inflation\nobjective—typically a range—and routinely issues reports detailing its performance in\nmeeting that objective. The central bank must explain the reasons for any deviations that\noccur. New Zealand went so far as to specify that the Governor could be dismissed for\nfailing to attain the target. The Bank of England not only has a numerical inflation target\nbut also gives explicit probabilistic assessments of the odds of alternative outcomes via a\nseries of so-called “fan charts.”\n1\n\nPerhaps one day the Fed will adopt an explicit numerical inflation objective. It\nhas not gone so far yet, but over the past decade, the Federal Open Market Committee has\ntaken many steps to improve its communications with the public, the markets, and the\npress, and thereby its transparency.\nThe rationale for increased central bank transparency is highly practical—not\nsimply ideological. The more people understand about the goals of monetary policy, and\nthe Committee’s strategy to achieve them, the more effective policy can be. One reason\nis because people’s expectations about future policy actions have a strong influence on\ntoday’s longer-term interest rates and on financial conditions more generally—including\nthe value of assets like equities and the dollar. And it is these broader financial\nconditions that influence people’s and firms’ economic decisions and plans. If the Fed’s\nonly leverage were on the overnight federal funds rate governing lending of deposits\nbetween financial institutions, it would have little effect on the economy. Better\ncommunication both strengthens and speeds the impact of the Fed’s policy moves on the\neconomy.\nImproved understanding of the Fed’s inflation objective can also serve to anchor\ninflationary expectations. That gives the Fed more latitude to respond to the adverse real\neconomic impact of supply shocks, such as an increase in the price of imported oil—\nwithout touching off an expectations-led, destabilizing wage-price spiral. So, greater\ntransparency can actually lead to better economic performance.\nI’ll give you some examples of the steps the Fed has taken toward greater\ntransparency. During the Greenspan era it became standard practice for the Committee to\nrelease an explicit statement following the end of a meeting announcing its policy\n2\n\nactions. Before that, Fed watchers had to infer policy changes from the Fed’s behavior in\nthe open market.\nOver time, the amount of information in that statement has also gradually\nincreased. For example, the Committee introduced language in 2000 describing its\nassessment of the balance of risks with respect to each of its objectives—price stability\nand growth. Then, in 2003, the statements included explicit discussions concerning\nlikely future policy actions. This was a controversial step. It was taken because the\nCommittee, probably for the first time since the Great Depression, became concerned\nabout the risk of deflation and the fact that the federal funds rate, at 1 percent, was about\nas low as it can go. Beginning in August 2003, it sought to condition market expectations\nabout future policy with the explicit statement that “policy accommodation can be\nmaintained for a considerable period.” This strategy likely served to hold down long-\nterm interest rates and stimulate economic growth.\nThe most recent move toward increased transparency, which began at the end of\nlast year, has been to speed up the release of the minutes so that they’re available before\nthe next meeting, rather than shortly after it. This is significant because it gives the\npublic more information in assessing the Fed’s next policy decision.\nThe minutes from the January meeting—released a week ago Wednesday--\nreiterated the views in the Committee’s statement after the meeting ended. It noted that,\nat present, inflation and longer-term inflation expectations remain well-contained, output\nappears to be growing at a moderate pace, and the risks to price stability and sustainable\ngrowth for the next few quarters are roughly equal. As a result, policy accommodation\nmost likely can be removed at a measured pace.\n3\n\nBut there are some big differences between the statement and the minutes. For\nexample, the minutes provide a wealth of information on the nuanced views of all 19\nparticipants in the discussion—one sees the full range of opinions in gory detail, rather\nthan just the consensus. In addition, the minutes for the January meeting contain a\ndiscussion of a longer-term topic the Committee considered--namely, the pros and cons\nof formulating an explicit numerical definition of the price stability objective of monetary\npolicy. The pros were basically the ones I already noted---a numerical objective might\nanchor inflation expectations, help with communication about likely future policy\nactions, and also provide greater clarity for Committee deliberations. The cons were that\nit might appear to be inconsistent with the Fed’s dual mandate of fostering maximum\nsustainable employment as well as price stability and that it might constrain policy at\ntimes. It was a lively discussion that may be rejoined in the future. Although I have\nsome sympathy with the con arguments, on balance, I generally favor increased\ntransparency and think the benefits of establishing a numerical objective are likely to\noutweigh the costs.\nDoes this description entice you to want to read the minutes? Well, before you\nrun out to download your own copy, let me be honest. The text will not rivet you with an\naction-packed, blow-by-blow account of clashing opinions. But it does lay out a range\nof issues--short-term, medium-term, and long-term--that the Committee is worried about.\nAnd that’s very fitting. After all, the classic description of Fed officials, and of central\nbankers generally, is that we’re people who are paid to worry about things.\n4\n\nU.S. economic prospects\nWith that bit of background, let me turn explicitly to my personal views concerning\nthe outlook for the U.S. economy—particularly the likely evolution of output,\nemployment, and inflation. Then I’ll spend a little time going over some of the things\nthat seem to me worth worrying about. Before I begin, I’d like to emphasize that my\nassessment of the outlook for the economy is quite consistent with the FOMC\nstatement—that the risks to moderate growth and price stability are both balanced.\nFirst, I’ll briefly review where we are in terms of the real economy and inflation\nand how we got here. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, which is\nthe semi-official arbiter of business cycle peaks and troughs, the U.S. economy has been\nexpanding since November 2001. Last summer, however, there was widespread concern\nthat the expansion might falter. Consumer spending, which has been the mainstay of this\nexpansion, suddenly and substantially slowed. It seemed likely at the time that energy\nprices were a culprit. Energy prices had increased a lot, and that increase took a big bite\nout of consumers’ wallets. It had the potential to noticeably depress spending on a wide\nrange of other goods and services. The hope was that the impact on spending would\ndiminish over time and the growth rate of consumer spending would spring back.\nThat is exactly what has happened. Consumer spending, and the economy overall,\nhave proven quite resilient. Investment spending by businesses has also picked up\nsubstantially. I now feel that we’ve seen enough positive signs to be reasonably\nconfident that the expansion is self-sustaining. Over the past year, output has grown at\njust under 4 percent, noticeably above trend, which is estimated to be 3-1/4 to 3-1/2\n5\n\npercent. And recent data show strength in business investment in equipment and\nsoftware, consumer spending, and housing.\nIn terms of the labor market, the expansion began as a jobless recovery, but the data\non job creation have been consistently positive for most of last year. Taking the average\nover all of 2004, the economy gained 181,000 jobs per month. In January it added\nanother 146,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate fell to 5.2 percent, reasonably close to\ncommon estimates of “full employment.” Other indicators, however, including the\nfraction of the population that is employed and measures of job vacancies suggest that\nquite a bit more slack remains than might be surmised from the unemployment rate. The\nrecord of job creation during the past year is by no means spectacular, but it’s good\nenough to suggest firming in the labor market and a gradual elimination of remaining\nslack. I would note that it takes a gain of about 125,000 to 140,000 jobs per month to\nmatch labor force growth, holding unemployment constant.\nNow, the outlook for inflation. The Committee tends to focus more on core\ninflation—that is inflation excluding volatile food and energy prices--and probably the\nbest measure of it is the personal consumption expenditures, or “PCE” price index. This\nmeasure’s behavior over the last twelve months has been generally quite reasonable—\naround the value I would endorse as a numerical, long-run inflation objective if the\nCommittee ever were to adopt one. It rose at 1-1/2 percent in 2004, up from just over 1\npercent in 2003—a period in which the Committee was worried that inflation might drop\nto a dangerously low level. The uptick this year probably reflects in part the pass-\nthrough of higher prices for oil, commodities, and imports. Given that I think the\neconomy will continue to grow modestly above trend and that inflation expectations will\n6\n\nremain stable, my expectation is that inflation in 2005 will be much as it was in 2004. I’d\nconsider this an excellent outcome, and I see the risks to it as roughly balanced.\nWorries\nBut, as I said, my job is be a worrier, so now let me turn to my list of worries—\ndevelopments or potential developments that could have an impact on economic activity\nand inflation. My list won’t be exhaustive--I’ll keep it to just five items, which are not in\nany particular order of concern. They are: oil prices, the trade gap, the saving rate,\nproductivity, and fiscal policy.\nWorry #1—oil prices. As I said, consumer spending has been remarkably resilient\nin the face of higher oil prices, but the evidence does suggest that there was some\nnegative impact on spending over the past year and oil prices have again ratcheted up\nover $50 per barrel. In terms of inflation, we have seen some modest upward pressure\ncoming from higher oil prices in the past year. The key question is whether this upward\npressure on inflation will persist or intensify. The answer depends on at least two factors.\nOne, obviously, is whether oil prices rise further. This is not what futures markets are\nforecasting, but it is a notoriously tricky thing to predict. The second is whether the\neffects on inflation today are changing people’s expectations about future inflation. As I\nindicated at the outset, if people begin to expect higher inflation because of the current\nimpact of oil prices, we could face a kind of scaled down version of the devastating\nwage-price spiral we lived through in the 1970s. The good news is that evidence from\nfinancial market indicators, surveys, and recent patterns of labor compensation all\nindicate that long-term inflation expectations have been extremely stable. Presumably,\n7\n\nthis reflects the market’s view that the Fed will continue to demonstrate that it’s willing\nto do what’s necessary to ensure U.S. price stability.\nWorry #2—the trade gap. This has risen from near balance in the mid-1990s to a\n(nominal) deficit of almost $700 billion now. By reducing the need for domestic\nproduction of goods and services, the trade deficit subtracted about three quarters of a\npercentage point from real GDP growth in the first half of this year. Whether the trade\ngap will narrow depends—in part—on the strength of economic growth among our\ntrading partners, because that affects demand for our exports. However, most of our\nmajor trading partners have had only moderate growth recently. So long as these\nconditions prevail, they won’t provide much impetus for growth in our own economy.\nOf course, prospects for the trade gap also depend on the prices of goods produced\nin the U.S. versus those produced abroad. It’s true that non-oil import prices have risen\nmodestly over the past year, while the prices of U.S. exports have declined relative to\nforeign price levels. Such price shifts do tend to curb imports and boost exports over\ntime. But they’re hardly enough to narrow the gap very quickly.\nWorry #3—the low saving rate. The personal saving rate has fallen over the past\ndecade from about 7 percent to under half a percent in the third quarter of this year. One\nreason that consumers are saving so little out of disposable income is that their wealth has\nbeen on the rise; in the latter half of the 1990s, rising stock prices had a lot to do with the\nincrease in wealth, but more recently, the main impetus has been house price\nappreciation. With interest rates rising now and housing prices unlikely to continuing\nadvancing at their recent robust pace, consumers will need to curtail their spending to\nkeep wealth growing in line with income. In other words, the saving rate might rise to\n8\n\nmore normal levels. If this happens, the falloff in spending growth by consumers could\nhave a significant effect on overall economic activity.\nWorry #4---productivity growth. The concern here is that some recent\ndevelopments hint at a slowdown in productivity growth. Slower productivity growth\nwould have negative consequences for economic activity and would boost inflation\nbecause less rapid productivity growth translates into more rapid increases in firms’\nproduction costs. One development hinting at slower productivity growth is the recent\nmoderation in the pace of price declines for high-tech goods. This could imply that\ntechnological progress is slowing to some extent. Another is the productivity data\nthemselves. Until recently, the productivity news was exceptionally good. Since the\nmiddle of the 1990s, the U.S. has been enjoying strong productivity growth. In the latter\nhalf of that decade, the pace of productivity growth was around 2-1/2%, a speedup of\nabout 1% relative to the 1973-1990 period. It is now recognized that that speedup was a\nkey reason why unemployment was able to drift so low without igniting inflationary\npressures—quite the contrary, inflation fell. Beginning in 2001, productivity grew even\nfaster—at an amazing 4% rate.\nThe very recent data have not been as good. In the last half of 2004, productivity\ngrowth slowed sharply—averaging less than 2 percent in the third and fourth quarters.1\nThough these numbers seem to confirm suspicions of a slowdown, I’d have to say I’m\nnot convinced on several counts. One is simply that productivity data are very typically\nquite volatile, so you just can’t make that much out of the performance over a few\nquarters. Second, the concern is not whether productivity growth will remain at that\n1 The official numbers show average growth of 1.3 percent. However, with fourth quarter real GDP having\nbeen revised up from 3.1 to 3.8 percent, it appears likely that the fourth quarter productivity number will be\nrevised up as well.\n9\n\namazing 4% rate—in fact, few economists would expect to see that. Rather, the issue is\nwhether productivity growth will remain at the current estimate of its trend rate, which,\naccording to several leading experts, is around 2-1/2%. If it does, that would be very\ngood news indeed. It would support robust output growth and help keep inflation well-\ncontained.\nMy view is fairly optimistic. I think there is some evidence that the economy is\ncontinuing to reap productivity gains from much of the investment firms and people\nalready have made. These reasons are laid out in a growing literature on technology and\nproductivity, much of which focuses on the significant lag that often exists between the\ntime that firms invest in technological capital and the time they benefit from greater\noutput and higher productivity. What takes time is the human element. People need time\nto learn how to get the most out of the technology they have. For example, one of our\ncontacts at the Fed—a lawyer!—told us that his firm had recently discovered they could\nuse search engines, rather than lawyers and paralegals, to look for incriminating evidence\nin emails. Beyond developing proficiency, people also need time to figure out how to\nreorganize their work processes to maximize the benefits of the technology they have.\nFor example, Sam Walton argued that he benefited in the 1980s and 1990s from\nknowledge he had accumulated in the 1960s and 1970s, when he flew around the country\nvisiting competing discount stores and attending IBM conferences. These anecdotes and\nanalyses suggest to me that this learning and reorganization is still ongoing and is likely\nto play out for a good while, providing a continuing boost to productivity growth.\nWorry #5---fiscal policy. Fiscal policy has been very stimulative in recent\nyears—we’ve had two large tax cut packages and an increase in spending on defense,\n10\n\nIraq, Afghanistan, and homeland security. In principle, it is appropriate for fiscal policy\nto stimulate demand during a recession, when private sector spending is sluggish.\nHowever, the policy went well beyond these desirable countercyclical effects. The tax\ncuts have mushroomed the deficit for the long term at a time when the baby-boomers are\nbecoming golden-agers and when the costs of retirement programs are set to soar. In\nfact, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are projected to rise dramatically as\nfractions of GDP over the next several decades. Currently projected budget deficits are\nunsustainable and will ensure a low level of national saving. Conventional economic\nanalysis suggest that this situation is likely to raise long-term interest rates, crowd-out\nbusiness capital investment, depress productivity growth, and exacerbate the current\naccount deficit.\nMonetary Policy\nI’ll conclude with just a few thoughts on monetary policy. To assess the stance of\nmonetary policy, economists commonly compare the inflation-adjusted level of the\nfederal funds rate to a benchmark rate called “neutral.” The neutral real federal funds\nrate is defined as the rate that would be consistent with full employment of the\neconomy’s labor and capital resources over the medium term. Efforts to quantify this\nrate, via statistical techniques or model-based simulations, take into account factors such\nas productivity growth in the economy, the stance of the fiscal policy, and the magnitude\nof the trade deficit that conceptually affect this neutral rate. Because these factors vary\nover time, the neutral rate also tends to change over time. In addition, I should\nemphasize that estimates of the neutral rate are highly uncertain. That said, reasonable\nestimates place the neutral real federal funds rate in the range of 1.5 to 3.5%. With\n11\n\ninflation now in the vicinity of 1.5%, the associated value of the nominal federal funds\nrate corresponding to “neutral” ranges from 3 to 5 percent.\nJudged from the perspective of a neutral policy stance, monetary policy at present\nis accommodative. At 2 ½ percent in nominal terms (about 1% in real terms), the federal\nfunds rate remains below the lower bound of the estimated neutral range. An\naccommodative monetary policy stance is appropriate when there is excess slack in the\nlabor market—the current situation--or when inflation is below desirable levels. In my\njudgment, inflation is now at a level consistent with price stability. With slack in the\neconomy diminishing, the degree of monetary accommodation also needs to diminish\nover time, toward neutral, for inflation to remain well contained. The Committee has\nstated for some time that, with underlying inflation remaining low, policy\naccommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. In fact, we have\nraised the rate by 25 basis points at each of the last six meetings. However, it should be\nobvious that the closer the actual rate gets to the neutral range, the more carefully the\nCommittee will need to consider each successive increase. In other words, the pace of\nremoving policy accommodation must, in reality, depend on how economic activity and\ninflation actually develop. Moreover, these developments themselves could affect the\nCommittee’s judgment concerning the momentum in aggregate demand or supply and\nthus the real federal funds rate corresponding to a neutral policy stance.\nIf the pace of economic activity accelerates and labor market slack erodes more\nquickly than expected--or if some of the upside risks to inflation materialize—it would\nprobably be appropriate to remove accommodation more rapidly. If, alternatively, the\nexpansion falters or we experience some of the downside inflation risks, there are likely\n12\n\nto be more opportunities for the Committee to pause. Policymakers could be confronted\nwith more difficult choices if output growth and inflation move in opposite directions.\nNaturally, risks to both growth and inflation abound. Nevertheless, I would reiterate that\nat present, the economy appears to be well positioned for healthy economic growth with\nstable inflation going forward. The upside and downside risks to both objectives appear\nto be roughly balanced.\n# # #\n13",

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nNational Small Business Week Event\nU.S. Chamber of Commerce\nWashington, D.C.\nMay 15, 2014\n\nThank you, Administrator Contreras-Sweet, I am pleased to be at the U.S.\nChamber, to have this opportunity to be part of Small Business Week, and to meet the\noutstanding entrepreneurs here this evening. I am also grateful to be able to share a few\nthoughts on the important role I believe small businesses have played and will continue to\nplay in America’s recovery from the financial crisis and the Great Recession.\nAfter the onset of the crisis, the Federal Reserve took extraordinary steps to\nstabilize the financial system and halt the plunge in economic activity. Since then, the\nFed has continued to use its monetary policy tools to promote the recovery and make\nprogress toward our mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability.\nBy putting downward pressure on interest rates, the Fed is trying to make financial\nconditions more accommodative--supporting asset values and lower borrowing costs for\nhouseholds and businesses and thus encouraging the spending that spurs job creation and\na stronger recovery.\nCrucial to this process, as I just mentioned, is job creation. The Federal Reserve\ntries to promote the conditions to foster job creation, but, overwhelmingly, it is\nbusinesses that create the jobs. About 85 percent of nonfarm employment is in the\nprivate sector, which traditionally is the source of a similarly large share of new jobs\nduring economic expansions. So far during this expansion, public-sector employment\nhas declined and the private sector has accounted for all of the net increase in\nemployment, so businesses have been even more crucial to job creation than usual.\nSmall businesses, of course, are responsible for a large share of these new jobs.\nAccording to the latest data from the Labor Department, a little more than half of the net\nnumber of jobs created since employment began growing in 2010 has been generated by\n\n- 2 -\nfirms with fewer than 250 employees, and most of that amount was accounted for by\nfirms with fewer than 50 employees.1\nOne of the reasons I wanted so much to be here this evening was to be able to\nacknowledge these important contributions. America has come a long way since the dark\ndays of the financial crisis, and small businesses deserve a considerable share of the\ncredit for the investment and hiring that have brought that progress. Although we have\ncome far, it is also true that we have further to go to achieve a healthy economy, and I am\ncertain that small businesses will continue to play a critical role in reaching that\nobjective.\nI am honored to be addressing the owners of 53 small businesses whose\nexcellence exemplifies the enormous contributions that millions of small businesses\ncollectively make to our economy. You come from different places and have achieved\nsuccess in a wide variety of ways, but you all share the entrepreneurial spirit that has\nalways been central to our nation’s prosperity. We at the Federal Reserve are keenly\naware of your vital role, and we pledge to continue to do our part in promoting the\nrecovery so that you can continue to help America grow and prosper.\nThank you.\n1 See Bureau of Labor Statistics (2014), “Business Employment Dynamics: Third Quarter 2013,” press\nrelease, April 29, www.bls.gov/news.release/cewbd.nr0.htm.",

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nCitizens Budget Commission\nNew York, New York\nMarch 3, 2015\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak to you today, it is great to be back in New\nYork. The Citizens Budget Commission has played an important role over the years as a\nforum to discuss issues of interest to New Yorkers that are often also of national and even\nglobal importance. Given New York’s preeminence as a center of global finance, I\nthought it would be appropriate to discuss just such a topic, which is how the Federal\nReserve oversees the largest financial institutions, many of which are headquartered or\nhave a major presence here, and how that oversight has strengthened since the financial\ncrisis.1\nThe Financial Crisis and Large Financial Institutions\nThe crisis had many causes, including the numerous factors that drove a lengthy\nhousing boom and the expansion of a largely unregulated “shadow banking system”\nrivaling the traditional banking sector in size. A self-reinforcing financial panic\nmagnified the damage from risks that had built up over many years throughout the\ncountry and across the financial system.\nBut to a considerable extent, large and complex financial institutions were the\nepicenter of the crisis. These institutions, some of which were not subject to Federal\nReserve oversight at the time, were the locus for much of the excessive risk-taking that\nled to the crisis. Due to their primacy and interconnections with the rest of the financial\nsystem, these large institutions were also the means by which the crisis spread quickly\nand with devastating effect through the economy.\n1 Although the Federal Reserve supervises entities with a range of legal forms, including depository\ninstitutions and holding companies, for the purposes of my remarks today, “financial institutions,” “firms,”\n“banks,” and “banking organizations” are used interchangeably unless indicated otherwise.\n\n- 2 -\nThe financial crisis and the recession caused great hardship for millions of\nindividuals and families in this city and in communities throughout our country. I believe\nall Americans share a common interest in working to make sure that our financial system\nis strong, resilient, and able to serve a healthy and growing economy. A critical part of\nour work since the crisis to promote a stable financial system has therefore involved\ngreater effort to ensure that large institutions are operating safely and soundly and are\nprepared to continue serving households and businesses even when faced with stressful\nfinancial conditions.\nIn the run-up to the crisis, large firms failed to adequately anticipate and manage\nrisks that grew and concentrated in their increasingly sprawling, diverse, and complex\noperations. Partly as a result, these firms had trouble retaining the trust of markets and\ncreditors when the financial system came under stress. Doubts quickly mounted about\nwhether these institutions could sustain losses in the value of many assets they held.\nFurther doubts were raised about whether these firms had enough cash and other liquid\nassets to meet the immediate or potential demands of short-term creditors and large\ninstitutional customers. In the lead-up to the crisis, many large institutions had become\nheavily reliant on very short-term borrowing, at relatively low rates, to fund lending and\nother operations providing higher returns. While this approach may have appeared to be\nan easy source of profit, it had the disadvantage of leaving those banks exposed to\ndevastating runs if short-term funding dried up, as it did in the crisis.\nLarge financial institutions, of course, were not alone in failing to see these risks.\nThe checks and balances that were widely expected to prevent excessive risk-taking by\nlarge financial firms--regulatory oversight and market discipline--did not do so.\n\n- 3 -\nGovernment agencies, including the Fed, failed to recognize the extent of the risks or\nhow severely they could damage the financial system and the economy. Investors failed\nto anticipate and understand the risks of large financial institutions’ activities that\nmaterialized during the crisis.\nBackground on Financial Regulation and Supervision\nBefore I turn to the Fed’s actions to improve oversight of large financial\ninstitutions, let me be clear about what I mean by “large institutions.” Generally, I have\nin mind those firms whose financial distress would pose a significant risk to financial\nstability--firms that are, in that sense, “systemically important.” This would include U.S.\nbanking organizations with large, complex, and often international operations; foreign\nbanking organizations with extensive U.S. operations; and other large and complex\nfinancial firms. Today the Federal Reserve subjects 16 of those firms to significantly\nhigher levels of oversight than are applied to other institutions.2 To put the scale and\nimportance of these firms in perspective, the 8 U.S. bank holding companies among these\n16 firms hold nearly 60 percent of all assets in the U.S. banking system.3\nThe Federal Reserve’s oversight of large financial institutions is aimed at\nensuring the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions as well as the\nresiliency of the financial system. The Fed expects the banks it oversees, including the\nlargest banks, to be financially sound. Two core elements of soundness are capital and\n2 A current list of these firms is available on the Federal Reserve Board’s webpage “Large Institution\nSupervision Coordinating Committee” at www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/large-institution-\nsupervision.htm. This list may evolve based on changes in firms’ relative systemic importance. Financial\nStability Oversight Council determinations of nonbank financial institutions subject to Federal Reserve\noversight are available on the U.S. Department of Treasury’s website at\nwww.treasury.gov/initiatives/fsoc/designations/Pages/default.aspx.\n3 Information is based on data from the most recent FR Y-9C report, which is filed quarterly by bank\nholding companies and savings and loan holding companies. To access the report, see the Board’s\nwebpage “Reporting Forms” at www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportforms/default.aspx.\n\n- 4 -\nliquidity. Capital is the funds provided by a bank’s shareholders that serve as a buffer to\nenable the firm to absorb unexpected losses, including during times of economic\ndownturn or financial stress. A bank’s liquidity is its ability to meet current and future\nobligations to customers and others with whom it enters into financial transactions.\nLiquidity is the lifeblood of a financial firm, because once liquidity dries up, the firm is\nno longer able to operate.\nBeyond focusing on capital and liquidity, the Fed also promotes safety and\nsoundness by seeking to ensure that banks are well managed and subject to strong\ngovernance by a board of directors responsible to shareholders. It is unfortunate that I\nneed to underscore this, but we expect the firms we oversee to follow the law and to\noperate in an ethical manner. Too often in recent years, bankers at large institutions have\nnot done so, sometimes brazenly. These incidents, both individually and in their totality,\nraise legitimate questions of whether there may be pervasive shortcomings in the values\nof large financial firms that might undermine their safety and soundness.4\nWhile the Federal Reserve looks closely at the individual safety and soundness of\nlarge financial firms, as I noted earlier, it is not sufficient to view each of these firms in\nisolation. The safety and soundness of large firms affects, and is affected by, the stability\nof the broader financial system. In the decades of relative financial stability leading up to\nthe crisis, it is fair to say that the Fed focused too much on individual firms and not\nenough on their role in the financial system and the implications of those firms’\n4\nFor more information, see Daniel K. Tarullo (2014), “Good Compliance, Not Mere Compliance,” speech\ndelivered at “Reforming Culture and Behavior in the Financial Services Industry,” a conference sponsored\nby the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, New York, N.Y., October 20,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/tarullo20141020a.htm.\n\n- 5 -\noperations for financial stability. To use an apt metaphor, we looked closely at the trees\nand not as intently as we should have at the forest. One of the most fundamental changes\nin the Fed’s oversight of large institutions since the crisis, a principle that undergirds\neverything I will discuss today, is elevating the importance of financial stability in that\noversight.\nThe Fed oversees financial institutions through regulation and supervision. While\nthey are often closely related, these are two distinct activities. On the one hand,\nregulation refers primarily to the rules that firms must follow. Regulation starts with\nlaws passed by Congress which are the basis for specific and detailed rules written by the\nFed and other agencies. Supervision, on the other hand, involves monitoring and\nexamining the day-to-day operations of these firms, including their financial condition,\nhow they manage risks, and their corporate governance, to make sure they are complying\nwith laws and regulations and operating in a safe and sound manner.\nThe Federal Reserve Board writes the regulations firms must follow, establishes\nsupervisory policies and, in close collaboration with the 12 regional Reserve Banks, is\ndeeply engaged in the supervision of large financial institutions. Much of the day-to-day\nwork of supervision, particularly for smaller banks, occurs locally through the Reserve\nBanks. For systemically important firms, the Board several years ago established the\nLarge Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee (LISCC) in order to assure well-\ncoordinated supervision.\nI consider the effective supervision of large institutions, to ensure their safety and\nsoundness and the stability of the financial system, to be one of the Federal Reserve\n\n- 6 -\nBoard’s most important responsibilities, and one of my most important responsibilities as\nChair.\nIn improving the oversight of large firms, the Federal Reserve has made it a top\npriority to ensure that we appropriately tailor our regulation and supervision of banks to\ntheir size, complexity, and risks.5 We will use statutory authorities to ensure that we\navoid a one-size-fits-all approach as we promulgate rules and regulations. As we\ncontinue this work, we will communicate to the Congress should we identify discrete\nissues that may benefit from further clarification or technical changes without\nundermining safety and soundness, such as those addressed by Congress last year related\nto capital requirements for insurance companies.\nPost-Crisis Regulation and Supervision of Large Financial Institutions\nRegulatory Reform\nRegulatory changes since the crisis have been extensive.6 While my emphasis\ntoday is on steps taken in the United States, I should also note that we work closely with\n5 See Daniel K. Tarullo (2014), “A Tiered Approach to Regulation and Supervision of Community Banks,”\nspeech delivered at the Community Bankers Symposium, Chicago, Ill., November 7,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/tarullo20141107a.htm; and Janet L.

We have made significant progress on our regulatory\nreform agenda both domestically and internationally, but we still have work to do.\nI will briefly describe five regulatory changes that have been among the most\nimportant in helping the Federal Reserve improve its oversight of the largest institutions.\nFirst, all banks are required to hold significantly more capital, with higher\nstandards applied to the largest, most systemically important firms. Second, large\ninstitutions have also been required to substantially increase their liquidity. The blueprint\nfor these higher capital and liquidity standards is an international agreement known as\nBasel III, which establishes minimum standards for internationally active banks around\nthe world; the United States, however, has gone even further to raise capital requirements\nfor the largest firms. Third, large firms are now required to show that they can continue\nto operate safely and serve their customers in stressful conditions similar to those that\noccurred during the crisis, an exercise known as stress testing. Fourth, under the Dodd-\nFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), Congress\nauthorized a new regime, known as “resolution,” to manage the failure of large firms in\nan orderly manner and reduce the chances that such a failure would threaten financial\nstability. The Congress empowered the Fed and the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (FDIC) to require large firms to develop resolution plans.\nThe fifth and final regulatory change I want to mention is that the Dodd-Frank\nAct also gave the Federal Reserve more explicit responsibilities for safeguarding\nfinancial stability. As applied to large institutions, more stringent capital requirements\nthe Peterson Institute for International Economics, Washington, May 3,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/tarullo20130503a.htm.\n\n- 8 -\nand the other regulatory changes I have just described are intended to promote the\nstability of the financial system. In addition, to address the fragmentation of\nresponsibility for financial stability across different agencies, the Fed is part of a new\ninteragency body, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which helps U.S. regulators\nwork together more effectively to better promote the stability of the financial system.\nEnhanced Supervision\nAlong with the additional tools provided by these regulatory changes, the Federal\nReserve has fortified its supervision of large financial institutions. We significantly\nenhanced the manner by which we assess whether these firms have sufficient capital and\nliquidity and are meeting new regulatory requirements in this area. We have substantially\nraised our expectations for how well the firms we supervise should be managing their\nrisks, maintaining internal controls, and exercising governance. And we have\nreorganized our supervision of large financial institutions to increase the quality,\nconsistency, and range of perspectives brought to bear on supervisory strategy and\ndecisionmaking.\nOne of the most important enhancements to large bank supervision since the\nfinancial crisis is our assessment of whether large institutions are holding enough capital\nto deal with stressful financial conditions. The program includes stress testing and a\nyearly review of how firms are planning their future capital needs.7 The latest results will\nbe disclosed in the coming days.\n7 The Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review applies to a larger number of institutions than the most\nsystemically important firms discussed in these remarks.\n\n- 9 -\nCapital stress testing for banks is not new but the Federal Reserve has employed it\nmuch more extensively since the crisis.8 Using information on a bank’s finances and\noperations, these tests gauge how a firm’s capital position would be affected by\nhypothetical scenarios covering a range of adverse economic and financial conditions.\nSuch tests show the potential harm faced by individual banks in stressful conditions and\nthus the potential that such problems could affect the stability of the financial system.\nThe goal is to see that large institutions have enough capital not just to survive in these\nconditions, but also to continue serving their customers. The Federal Reserve conducts\nstress tests once a year, and the firms are required to run their own tests and disclose\nresults to the public twice a year.\nStress testing is an important tool, but it is not sufficient to provide a full picture\nof the capital adequacy of large firms.9 The Fed also looks at other aspects of large\nbanks’ capital planning, such as their risk management, internal controls, and\ngovernance. If the Federal Reserve is not satisfied with the results from capital stress\ntests or identifies shortcomings in a firm’s capital planning, we may restrict the firm’s\nability to pay dividends, buy back shares, or take other actions that would reduce its\ncapital base.\nIn addition to these steps related to capital, in 2012 the Federal Reserve began a\ncomprehensive assessment of large banks’ liquidity.10 We review the firms’ own\n8 In addition to ad hoc stress testing that was conducted throughout the crisis, in 2009 the Federal Reserve\nand the other U.S. federal banking agencies undertook the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program at the\n19 largest U.S. bank holding companies. This exercise played a key role in publicly identifying capital\ndeficiencies at the largest firms and bolstering market confidence by requiring companies to address these\ndeficiencies.\n9\nFor more information about the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review exercise and interagency\nDodd-Frank Act stress-testing requirements, see the webpage “Stress Tests and Capital Planning” on the\nBoard’s website at www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/stress-tests-capital-planning.htm.\n10 This Federal Reserve assessment is known as the Comprehensive Liquidity Analysis and Review.\n\n- 10 -\nliquidity stress tests, and we conduct an independent assessment of their liquidity. These\nliquidity exercises provide a regular opportunity for Fed supervisors to respond to\nevolving liquidity risks and firm practices over time. Through this effort, we can require\nlarge firms to take specific actions to bolster their liquidity or enhance the way they\nmanage their liquidity risks.\nThrough stress testing and other improvements to supervision, the Federal\nReserve is requiring more of large institutions. We are also requiring more of ourselves.\nBefore the crisis, the Fed’s supervision of large institutions did not make the fullest and\nmost effective use of the expertise of our staff across the Federal Reserve System. To\nimprove our supervision of the largest systemically important firms, we have created the\nLarge Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee, which I mentioned earlier. The\nLISCC brings together experts from around the Federal Reserve System in the areas of\nsupervision, research, legal, financial markets, and payment systems in a centralized body\nled by the Federal Reserve Board.\nThe LISCC program enhances supervision in several ways. First, by looking at\nfirms both individually and collectively, it helps ensure supervisors are well positioned to\nidentify issues at individual firms as well as trends across and interconnections among\nfirms that may pose risks to financial stability. The LISCC also promotes high standards\nand consistency in the supervision of large firms through a centralized yet Systemwide\napproach. By bringing together staff members from across the Federal Reserve System,\nthe LISCC is designed to ensure that diverse views and perspectives are brought to bear\non important decisions about the supervision of systemically important firms. Lastly, the\ndiversity of skills among the Fed experts involved in the LISCC allows it to consider\n\n- 11 -\nfinancial stability risks from the broader economy, financial markets, and other sources.\nThe LISCC also builds on the comprehensive analysis of financial stability by the\nBoard’s Office of Financial Stability Policy and Research, which was established after\nthe financial crisis.\nThe Federal Reserve has significant responsibilities for supervising large financial\ninstitutions, but we cannot guarantee their stability on our own. It is important that we\ncommunicate and coordinate with other U.S. financial regulatory agencies with\nresponsibilities that affect the safety and soundness of large institutions. We also need to\ncooperate with supervisors in other countries where these firms operate. This\ncooperation helps us understand developments in a complex and global financial system\nthat have implications for individual firms or for large institutions generally. It can also\nprovide information and perspective about firms whose supervision we may share with\nother agencies or governments. In addition, it facilitates a coordinated approach to\nensuring that large firms are operating in a safe and sound manner.\nTo be effective, regulation and supervision must be independent of the entities\nsubject to oversight. You may know or have heard the term “regulatory capture.”\nRegulatory capture is when a regulatory agency advances the interests of the industry it is\nsupposed to oversee rather than the broader public interest it should represent.11\nRegulatory capture, which may occur in the oversight of any industry, can happen in both\nintentional and inadvertent ways. The most blatant ways involve tangible conflicts of\ninterest--for example the expectation government officials might have of future rewards\n11 A body of economic literature addresses regulatory capture, with perhaps one of the most influential\nworks being George J. Stigler (1971), “The Theory of Economic Regulation,” Bell Journal of Economics\nand Management Science, vol. 2 (Spring), pp. 3-21. See also Ernesto Dal Bó (2006), “Regulatory Capture:\nA Review,” Oxford Review of Economic Policy, vol. 22 (Summer), pp. 203-25.\n\n- 12 -\nfrom the industry they oversee. But experience and extensive research shows that\nregulatory capture also occurs in less tangible ways, when close contact and familiarity\nbetween individuals leads those enforcing the rules to sympathize with those they\noversee. Whatever the source, the risk of regulatory capture is something the Federal\nReserve takes very seriously and works very hard to prevent. We enforce strict ethics\nrules and promote strong values among our employees, among them a commitment to\npublic service. It is important that anyone serving the Fed feel safe speaking up when\nthey have concerns about bias toward industry, and that those concerns be addressed.\nThe broadening of expertise and participation in supervision conducted by the LISCC, as\noverseen by the Board, represents yet another check to the risk of regulatory capture in\nthe oversight of large firms.\nThe Results of Improved Supervision\nI believe the changes I have described have significantly improved the strength\nand stability of large financial institutions and the financial system.\nAs I mentioned earlier, strong capital and liquidity are fundamental to the\nresiliency of large institutions. The good news is that the amount and quality of capital\nand the strength of liquidity positions at large firms are greatly improved since the crisis.\nWhile some of the improvement in the capital positions of large firms is due to\nthe regulatory changes I have described that are being phased in over the next several\nyears, some of it has come as a direct result of the Fed’s capital planning and stress-\ntesting requirements. From early 2009 through 2014, capital held by the eight most\nsystemically important U.S. bank holding companies more than doubled, reflecting an\n\n- 13 -\nincrease of almost $500 billion in the strongest form of capital held by these companies.12\nLikewise, the Federal Reserve’s increased focus on liquidity has contributed to\nsignificant increases in firms’ liquidity. The high-quality liquid assets held by these eight\nfirms has increased by roughly one-third since 2012, and their reliance on short-term\nwholesale funding has dropped considerably.\nBeyond these very tangible gains, we see some evidence of improved risk\nmanagement, internal controls, and governance at large firms. But large firms still have\nroom for improvement in this area, and supervisors will be watching closely. The\ncompliance breakdowns in recent years that I mentioned earlier in my remarks undermine\nconfidence in large firms’ risk management and controls, which has implications for\nfinancial stability. The Fed has taken and will continue to take swift and meaningful\naction to ensure that firms focus on their risk-management practices and continue to\nstrengthen them.\nBoth the Federal Reserve and the large firms we oversee have become more\nforward looking in evaluating these firms’ capacity to withstand significant financial\nstress, which has enhanced financial stability. Much of this new perspective has come\nthrough our capital and liquidity reviews, which require both firms and supervisors to\nmake financial projections into the future rather than simply relying on current and past\nperformance. Likewise, requiring firms to plan for their possible demise and orderly\nresolution has forced them to think more carefully about the sustainability of their\nbusiness models and corporate structures.\n12 Specifically, for the period from 2009 to 2013, tier 1 common equity as defined in the Board’s regulatory\ncapital regulations, and in 2014, common equity tier 1 capital, due to changes in regulatory capital\nregulations.\n\n- 14 -\nWe have a more consistent and industry-wide perspective on risks and\nvulnerabilities than we had prior to the crisis. The focus on individual firms is still\nextremely important, but we now supplement this approach more systematically with\nreviews of issues across multiple firms simultaneously. These reviews allow us to\nidentify common themes and unacceptable practices among large firms that will enable\nus to take consistent and effective action.\nLastly, I believe the resolution authority enacted by the Congress and our work\nwith the FDIC on the orderly resolution of large institutions are reducing the problem of\nfirms considered “too big to fail” by addressing the risks a failure of a large firm would\npose to the financial system. The plans developed by the largest firms to date still have a\nnumber of shortcomings, but the Federal Reserve has asked for and expects these\ninstitutions to make substantial progress in the coming months which will leave firms and\nthe government better positioned to manage the failure of a large institution in an orderly\nway.13\nThe goal, through this and other actions I have described today, is to do whatever\ncan be done to avert the dire threat and lasting damage of a severe financial crisis. We\ncannot eliminate the possibility of another crisis, but we can make a crisis less likely and\nless damaging by limiting excessive risk-taking by firms we oversee and by helping\nensure that the most systemically important firms are better prepared to weather a crisis.\nWe have focused our efforts on the largest firms because they were and continue\nto be crucial to the financial system and its ability to support the financial needs of\n13\nSee Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n(2014), “Agencies Provide Feedback on Second Round Resolution Plans of ‘First-Wave’ Filers,” joint\npress release, August 5, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20140805a.htm.\n\n- 15 -\nhouseholds and businesses.

Yellen\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nAmerican Economic Association/American Finance Association Joint Luncheon\nSan Diego, California\nJanuary 4, 2013\n\nThank you, Claudia, and thanks to the American Economic Association and the\nAmerican Finance Association for the opportunity to speak to you on a topic of growing\ninterest to our profession and of great importance to understanding the causes and\nimplications of the financial crisis.1\nEveryone here today, I’m sure, is familiar with the tumultuous events that\nintroduced many Americans to the concept of systemic risk. To recap briefly, losses\narising from leveraged investments caused a few important, but perhaps not essential,\nfinancial institutions to fail. At first, the damage appeared to be contained, but the\nresulting stresses revealed extensive interconnections among traditional banks,\ninvestment houses, and the rapidly growing and less regulated shadow banking sector.\nMarket participants lost confidence in their trading partners, and, as the crisis unfolded,\nthe financial sector struggled to cope with a massive withdrawal of liquidity, the collapse\nof one of its most prominent institutions, and a 40 percent drop in equity prices.2 The\neffects of the crisis were felt far beyond the financial sector as credit dried up and a mild\nrecession became something far worse. You are also, no doubt, familiar with the political\nresponse to that crisis. After considerable debate, the Congress passed sweeping reform\nlegislation designed to place the nation’s financial infrastructure on a more solid\nfoundation.\nI’m referring, of course, to the banking panic of 1907. The legislation that\nPresident Wilson signed in December 1913 created the Federal Reserve, providing the\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve\nSystem. I am indebted to members of the Board staff--Celso Brunetti, Cecilia Caglio, Sean Campbell, Erik\nHeitfield, and John Maggs--who contributed to the preparation of these remarks.\n2 The level of the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 43.8 percent between November 15, 1906 (94.25),\nand November 15, 1907 (53.00). See Dow Jones & Company (2012).\n\n- 2 -\nnation with a lender of last resort to respond to such crises.3 As we approach the\ncentennial of the Federal Reserve System, it is striking how many of the challenges of\nthat era remain with us today. In 1907, the correspondent banking networks that helped\nconcentrate reserves in New York and other money centers also made the banking system\nhighly interconnected. Today, our capability to monitor and model financial outcomes is\nvastly greater, and the tools available to the Federal Reserve are vastly more powerful,\nthan the private capital and moral suasion that financier J. P. Morgan summoned in 1907\nto stabilize the banks and trusts. But as we learned during the recent crisis, the financial\nsystem has also grown much larger and more complex, and our efforts to understand and\ninfluence it have, at best, only kept pace.\nComplex links among financial market participants and institutions are a hallmark\nof the modern global financial system. Across geographic and market boundaries, agents\nwithin the financial system engage in a diverse array of transactions and relationships that\nconnect them to other participants. Indeed, much of the financial innovation that\npreceded the most recent financial crisis increased both the number and types of\nconnections that linked borrowers and lenders in the economy. The rapid growth in\nsecuritization and derivatives markets prior to the crisis provides a stark example of this\nphenomenon. As shown in figure 1, between 2000 and 2007, the notional value of\ncollateralized debt obligations outstanding increased from less than $300 billion to more\nthan $1.4 trillion.4 From 2004, the earliest date for which comprehensive data are\navailable, to 2007, the outstanding notional amount of credit default swap (CDS)\n3 See Federal Reserve Act, ch. 6, 38 Stat. 251 (1913).\n4 See Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (2012). Collateralized debt obligations\n(CDOs) are a general class of securitized products consisting of bonds that represent claims on the future\ncash flows generated by a variety of financial assets, including corporate debt and mortgage-backed\nsecurities. Growth in notional amounts of CDOs is indicative of the growth in economic exposure.\n\n- 3 -\ncontracts increased tenfold, from $6 trillion to $60 trillion.5 This incredible growth in\nsecuritization and derivatives markets reflects a significant increase in the number, types,\nand complexity of network connections in the financial system.\nFinancial economists have long stressed the benefits of interactions among\nfinancial intermediaries, and there is little doubt that some degree of interconnectedness\nis vital to the functioning of our financial system. Economists take a well-reasoned and\ndim view of autarky as the path to growth and stability. Banks and other financial\nintermediaries channel capital from savers, who often have short-term liquidity demands,\ninto productive investments that typically require stable, long-term funding. Financial\nintermediaries work with one another because no single institution can hope to access the\nfull range of available capital and investment opportunities in our complex economy.\nConnections among market actors also facilitate risk sharing, which can help minimize\n(though not eliminate) the uncertainty faced by individual agents. Yet experience--most\nimportantly, our recent financial crisis--as well as a growing body of academic research\nsuggests that interconnections among financial intermediaries are not an unalloyed good.\nComplex interactions among market actors may serve to amplify existing market\nfrictions, information asymmetries, or other externalities. The difficult task before\nmarket participants, policymakers, and regulators with systemic risk responsibilities such\nas the Federal Reserve is to find ways to preserve the benefits of interconnectedness in\nfinancial markets while managing the potentially harmful side effects. Indeed, new\nregulations required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection\n5 A CDS is a derivative contract in which one party, the protection “seller,” agrees to insure another party,\nthe protection “buyer,” from default on an underlying bond or index of bonds in exchange for a fee.\nNotional amounts do not reflect the economic exposure in these markets, which is a small fraction of the\nnotional value, but the growth noted here is indicative of the growth in exposure. See Bank for\nInternational Settlements (2012b).\n\n- 4 -\nAct of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act) and changes in supervisory practices by the Federal\nReserve and other financial regulators are intended to do just that.\nIn my remarks, I will discuss a few of the major regulatory and supervisory\nchanges under way to address the potential for excessive systemic risk arising from the\ncomplexity and interconnectedness that characterize our financial system. The design of\nan appropriate regulatory framework entails tradeoffs between costs and benefits, and to\nillustrate them, I will discuss in some detail proposals currently under consideration to\nmitigate risk in over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, which proved to be an important\nchannel for the transmission of risk during the recent crisis. I am quite aware that some\nreforms in the wake of the financial crisis, including those pertaining to derivatives, have\nbeen controversial. In connection with recent rulemakings--and, more broadly, in the\narena of public debate--critics have asked whether complexity and interconnectedness\nshould be treated as potential sources of systemic risk. This is a legitimate question that\nthe Federal Reserve welcomes and itself seeks to answer in its roles of researcher,\nregulator, and supervisor. Let me say at the outset, though, that a lack of complete\ncertainty about potential outcomes is not a justification for inaction, considering the size\nof the threat encountered in the recent crisis.\nResponsible policymakers try to make decisions with the best information\navailable but would always like to know more. With that in mind, I’ll begin by briefly\nsurveying research that highlights ways in which network structure and\ninterconnectedness can give rise to or exacerbate systemic risk in the financial system.\n\n- 5 -\nThe Economics of Interconnectedness and Systemic Risk\nAcademic research that explores the relationship between network structure and\nsystemic risk is relatively new. Not surprisingly, interest in this field has increased\nconsiderably since the financial crisis. A search of economics research focusing on\n“systemic risk” or “interconnectedness” since 2007 yields 624 publications, twice as\nmany as were produced in the previous 25 years.6 That’s not to say that economists were\nblind to the importance of networks before the financial crisis. In 2000, Franklin Allen\nand Douglas Gale, for example, developed an important model of financial networks that\nprovides insight into how networks can influence systemic risk.7\nIn the model studied by Allen and Gale, systemic risk arises through liquidity\nshocks that can have a domino effect, causing a problem at one bank to spread to others,\npotentially leading to failures throughout the system. In their model, interbank deposits\nare a primary mechanism for the transmission of liquidity shocks from one bank to\nanother. Allen and Gale compare two canonical network structures: a “complete”\nnetwork, in which all banks lend to and borrow from all other banks, and an “incomplete”\nnetwork, in which each bank borrows from only one neighbor and lends to only one other\nneighbor. Figure 2, panel A, presents an example of a complete network, and figure 2,\npanel B, an example of an incomplete network.\nIn the case of the complete network, banks benefit from diversified funding\nstreams. A liquidity shock at one bank is less likely to cause the bankruptcy of another\n6 A search for either “interconnectedness” or “systemic risk” in article abstracts of academic research\ncataloged by EconLit results in 311 entries from 1988 to 2006. The same search conducted for the period\nfrom 2007 through the present yields 624 entries. Restricting the search to articles that have appeared in\npeer-reviewed journals reduces the number of entries between 1988 and 2006 to 186 and the number of\nentries between 2007 and the present to 375.\n7 See Allen and Gale (2000).\n\n- 6 -\nbank since the shock can be distributed among all banks in the system. In the incomplete\nnetwork, funding is not diversified. A liquidity shock at one bank is more likely to cause\nliquidity problems at other connected banks because the same shock is spread over fewer\nbanks and is therefore larger and more destabilizing. The principle behind this result is\nfamiliar and basic to economics: Diversification reduces risk and improves stability.\nWhile this idea is compelling, both economic research and the events of the financial\ncrisis suggest that it is incomplete.\nIn their classic paper on bank runs, Douglas Diamond and Philip Dybvig showed\nhow rational and prudent actions by individual depositors to limit their own risks may be\nhighly destabilizing to an institution designed to transform short-term liabilities into long-\nterm assets.8 Xavier Freixas, Bruno Parigi, and Jean-Charles Rochet show that a similar\nkind of collective action problem can arise in a network akin to a modern check-clearing\nsystem in which credit extensions among banks allow claims on one institution to be\nfulfilled by another.9 Such a system is socially useful because it allows depositors to shift\nfunds among banks without forcing banks to sell illiquid assets, thus enabling society as a\nwhole to undertake more productive, long-term investment. But in times of stress or\nuncertainty, such systems can be subject to coordination failures: A “gridlock”\nequilibrium can arise in which depositors at each bank withdraw funds early in order to\navoid losses arising from credit extensions to other banks whose depositors are also\nexpected to force an early liquidation of assets. In Freixas, Parigi, and Rochet (2000),\ninterbank credit extensions, while useful, can result in institutions that are “too\ninterconnected to fail.” These models underscore that the pattern of connections\n8 See Diamond and Dybvig (1983).\n9 See Freixas, Parigi, and Rochet (2000).\n\n- 7 -\nthroughout a financial network determines the systemwide implications of liquidity\nshocks or other financial stresses in one part of the network. This finding is one reason\nwhy efforts to collect more and better data on the precise linkages among financial\ninstitutions are so important. Without such comprehensive and detailed data, it is simply\nnot possible to understand how stress in one part of the network may spread and affect\nthe entire system.\nNetworks that are more interconnected are inherently more complex than those in\nwhich market participants have fewer links to one another, and complexity can\nexacerbate the kinds of coordination problems highlighted by Diamond and Dybvig and\nby Freixas, Parigi, and Rochet. Of course, “complexity” is difficult to define in a\ncompletely systematic and satisfactory manner, but one way emphasized in recent work\nby Hyun Song Shin is to consider the number of links required to connect savers to\nborrowers.10 Shin’s analysis of interconnectedness among financial institutions is based\non the idea that the ultimate amount of lending and borrowing that can occur in an\neconomy is determined by economic fundamentals such as income growth, which change\nonly slowly over time, whereas interbank claims can grow or contract far more quickly.\nOf course, claims within the entire financial system net out to zero, but they do affect the\nleverage of the institutions involved. In Shin’s model, financial institutions seek to take\non more leverage during a boom, when banks have strong capital positions and risks are\nperceived to be low, but can increase leverage, in the aggregate, only by borrowing and\nlending more intensively to each other. This causes the resulting network of intertwining\nclaims to extend further and further. Conversely, when fundamental conditions or market\nsentiments change and financial institutions prefer to shed risk, they can deleverage in the\n10 See Shin (2009).\n\n- 8 -\nshort term only by withdrawing credit from one another. Such deleveraging can be\nparticularly destabilizing in longer intermediation chains as debt claims that are called by\none financial intermediary to shore up its own assets adversely affect the liability sides of\nother institutions’ balance sheets. As deleveraging accelerates and more and more\nfinancial institutions hoard liquidity, other institutions may become concerned that their\nown funding may dry up and may preemptively withdraw funding from others.\nFundamentally strong institutions are forced to liquidate assets at fire sale prices, which\nresults in more deleveraging and instability.\nMore-complex network structures are likely to be more opaque than less complex\nones. For example, as the number of intermediaries standing between borrowers and\nlenders grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to understand how one member of the\nnetwork fits into the overall system. The well-publicized difficulties that some mortgage\nborrowers have had in simply figuring out who owns their mortgages illustrates the\nextent to which lengthening intermediation chains have increased the complexity of the\nfinancial system. Moreover, in many cases, market participants may have strong\nincentives not to disclose their connections to one another. If a bank has a profitable\nrelationship with a borrower, it may be unwilling to disclose it to other banks for fear that\ncompetitors will reduce or eliminate the rents that it earns.\nRicardo Caballero and Alp Simsek illustrate how a lack of information can create\nsystemic risk in financial networks.11 In a model that is structurally similar to the\nincomplete interbank network model of Allen and Gale, Caballero and Simsek examine\nhow banks might respond to news of a liquidity shock when each bank knows the\nidentities of its own counterparties but not the identities of its counterparties’\n11 See Caballero and Simsek (2011).\n\n- 9 -\ncounterparties. The authors posit that banks deal with this uncertainty by appealing to the\n“maximin principle”: Each seeks to maximize profits under the assumption that the\nnetwork is configured in the worst possible manner from its own perspective. Because\neach behaves as though the network structure is “stacked against it,” when banks learn of\nan adverse liquidity shock, each tends to sell more of its illiquid assets and withdraw\nmore funding from its counterparties than it would if it had access to complete\ninformation about the structure of interbank credit relationships. As in Shin’s model, this\nexcessive deleveraging can create a vicious cycle, magnifying the effects of the initial\nshock.\nThe four models we’ve discussed thus far are aimed at exploring general features\nof financial networks. As such, they are necessarily somewhat abstract. With a few\nnarrow exceptions, they treat all market participants as similar in size and in range of\nactivities, and they use relatively simplistic network structures. In the past few years,\nresearch on financial networks has moved beyond stylized models of interbank\nrelationships to examine the propagation of shocks in more-realistic settings. Recent\nresearch by Gai, Haldane, and Kapadia and by Cont, Moussa, and Santos examines how\nshocks propagate in network structures in which some banks are larger and more\ninterconnected than others.12\nUsing numerical simulations, Gai, Haldane, and Kapadia show that, in\nconcentrated networks, contagion occurs less frequently and is less severe for low\ndegrees of network connectivity. Contagion is significantly more likely at higher levels\nof connectivity. In a concentrated financial network with a few key players, and when\nliquidity shocks are targeted at the most connected institutions, distress at highly\n12 See Gai, Haldane, and Kapadia (2010) and Cont, Moussa, and Santos (2012).\n\n- 10 -\nconnected banks spreads widely through the rest of the system. In this sense, the\nintuition of Allen and Gale--that highly connected networks are resilient to systemic\nshocks--can be misleading. In an empirical study of 3,000 Brazilian banks, Cont,\nMoussa, and Santos find that, not surprisingly, institutions with larger interbank\nexposures tend to be more systemically important. But, critically, they also find that an\ninstitution’s position within the financial network plays a significant role. A bank that\ndoes business with a large number of relatively weak counterparties may have greater\nsystemic importance than an institution with a similar number of counterparties that are\nbetter equipped to manage potential losses.\nThe work of Gai, Haldane, and Kapadia and that of Cont, Moussa, and Santos\nsuggest that detailed and comprehensive data on the structure of financial networks is\nneeded to understand the systemic risks facing the financial system and to gauge the\ncontributions to systemic risk by individual institutions. I will describe in a moment how\nthe Federal Reserve is using such data to enhance its understanding of the OTC\nderivatives market. This line of research suggests that a one-size-fits-all approach to the\nregulation of financial intermediaries may not be appropriate.\nSo, what have we learned from this brief tour through recent research on\ninterconnectedness and systemic risk? We have seen how interconnectedness can be a\nsource of strength for financial institutions, allowing them to diversify risk while\nproviding liquidity and investment opportunities to savers that would not be available\notherwise. But more-numerous and more-complex linkages also appear to make it more\ndifficult for institutions to address certain types of externalities, such as those arising\nfrom incomplete information or a lack of coordination among market participants. These\n\n- 11 -\nexternalities may do little harm or may even be irrelevant in normal times, but they can\nbe devastating during a crisis.\nThe Global Policy Response to Reduce Systemic Risk\nGovernments around the globe have responded to the financial crisis by adopting\na strong, multifaceted, and coordinated reform agenda aimed at reducing systemic risk.\nAt a meeting in Pittsburgh in September 2009, governments in the Group of Twenty\n(G-20) endorsed work already under way in the Basel Committee on Banking\nSupervision to improve capital and the management of liquidity risk in the banking\nsystem.13 I’ll briefly review several Basel Committee initiatives that address\ninterconnectedness and systemic risk, but first, let me focus on one in particular: higher\ncapital requirements for global systemically important banks (GSIBs).\nEnhanced capital standards for GSIBs serve to limit the risks undertaken by the\nlargest, most interconnected institutions whose distress has the greatest potential to\nimpose negative externalities on the broader financial system. A framework of higher\nminimum regulatory capital standards for these institutions was issued by the Basel\nCommittee in November 2011, and indicators of interconnectedness account for a\nsignificant proportion of the overall score used to determine whether a bank will be\nsubject to higher standards.14 As shown by Gai, Haldane, and Kapadia, among others,\nhighly interconnected firms can transmit shocks widely, impairing the rest of the\nfinancial system and the economy. We saw, for example, that when Lehman Brothers\nfailed, the shock was transmitted through money market mutual funds to the short-term\n13 See Group of Twenty (2009).\n14 See Bank for International Settlements (2011). It should also be noted that while the assessment\nmethodology depends on interconnectedness, the specific measures employed will be continually reviewed\nand updated as appropriate.\n\n- 12 -\nfunding and interbank markets. While some participants in each of these sectors had\ndirect exposures to Lehman, many more did not. Moreover, even in cases in which direct\nexposures to Lehman were manageable, the turmoil caused by Lehman’s failure added\nstress to the system at a particularly unwelcome time. In this way, the failure of a highly\ninterconnected institution such as Lehman imposes costs on society well in excess of\nthose borne by the firm’s shareholders and direct creditors. Accordingly, tying enhanced\ncapital requirements to interconnectedness improves the resilience of the system. Of\ncourse, higher capital requirements are not costless; they may raise financing costs for\nsome borrowers, and they have the potential to induce institutions to engage in regulatory\narbitrage. An important ongoing agenda for research and policy is the design and\nimplementation of data-based measures of interconnectedness to ensure that our\nunderstanding of financial system interconnections evolves in tandem with financial\ninnovation.\nWhile enhanced capital standards for GSIBs are an important tool for managing\nsystemic risk that arises through interconnectedness, they are not the only tool. The\nBasel Committee’s program contains a number of initiatives that will help manage\ninterconnectedness and systemic risk. These measures include countercyclical capital\nbuffers, liquidity requirements, increased capital charges for exposures to large financial\ninstitutions, large exposure rules, and deductions from capital for equity investments in\nbanks.15 These and other initiatives will all play a role in managing the effect of\ncomplexity and interconnectedness on financial stability. In fact, the multifaceted nature\nof the reform program is an important design principle. One of the lessons of the recent\n15 For a description of these and related regulatory initiatives, see Bank for International Settlements\n(2010).\n\n- 13 -\nfinancial crisis was that capital alone is not sufficient to prevent or stem a crisis. Multiple\nchannels for reform initiatives will enhance systemic stability.\nManaging Tradeoffs between Reducing Systemic Risk and Increasing Costs:\nOTC Derivatives Market Reforms\nIn addition to the banking reforms I just discussed, the G-20 also committed to\nreduce risk in OTC derivatives markets by enacting reforms to improve transparency and\ndecrease counterparty exposures among market participants. These policies must be\nconsidered carefully, as they are apt to increase the cost of financial intermediation and\nthat of hedging risk. To illustrate the tradeoffs policymakers and regulators must manage\nwhen crafting such policies, I’ll next discuss in some detail a set of initiatives currently\nbeing implemented by prudential, market, and systemic risk regulators around the world\nto address weaknesses in OTC derivatives markets.\nAn OTC derivative is a privately negotiated contract between a pair of\ncounterparties to exchange future cash flows that depend on the performance of an\nunderlying asset or benchmark index. Unlike an immediate purchase or sale of assets,\nOTC derivatives require one or both sides of the transaction to make payments in the\nfuture. Counterparty risk is therefore a key element of OTC derivatives transactions.\nThe scale and significance of counterparty risks in the OTC derivatives markets are large\nand, as we saw, can have economy-wide implications. The prudent management,\nregulation, and oversight of these risks are critical to ensuring that derivatives markets\nserve to diversify, rather than exacerbate, systemic risk.\nSignificant problems with the functioning, regulation, and oversight of derivatives\nmarkets became apparent during the financial crisis. These problems are perhaps best\nexemplified by the widespread effects of large losses by American International Group,\n\n- 14 -\nInc. (AIG), on its OTC structured finance and credit derivatives positions. In the absence\nof government intervention, AIG’s failure would have exposed its counterparties to\nsubstantial losses at a time of significant financial stress and uncertainty for them and the\nfinancial system. Indeed, for a time, the prospect of AIG’s failure exacerbated the\nalready impaired functioning in important segments of the OTC market, and, as that\nhappened, it became more costly or even impossible for firms to manage financial risks.\nDerivatives positions originally undertaken by some firms to hedge risk could not be\nunwound and instead became sources of risk. AIG’s failure revealed, in stark and\nspectacular fashion, systemic problems inherent in the structure and functioning of OTC\nderivatives markets that had increased the fragility of the financial system, exposing the\nrest of the economy to unnecessary systemic risks. Central clearing mandates, minimum\nmargin standards, and data reporting requirements are among the tools that regulators\nnow intend to use to mitigate counterparty risk and improve transparency, thus reducing\nuncertainty.\nThe September 2009 commitment of the G-20 to require that standardized OTC\nderivatives be cleared through central counterparties is directly aimed at reducing\nsystemic risk by changing the structure of the network of derivatives counterparty\nexposures.16 In the absence of a central counterparty, the network of counterparty\nexposures associated with a class of OTC contracts might look something like panel A in\nfigure 3. Each market participant has counterparty risk exposures to one or more other\nmarket participants. Although each participant knows its own risk exposure, it is unlikely\nto have complete information on its counterparties’ exposures to others. Such opacity\ncan engender the kind of information-related gridlock that we observed in the fall of 2008\n16 See Group of Twenty (2009), “Improving Over-the-Counter Derivatives Markets” (in item 13).\n\n- 15 -\nand that is explored in the research of Caballero and Simsek. Moreover, because market\nparticipants commonly have partially or fully offsetting positions with multiple\ncounterparties, a fully bilateral network is inefficient from a risk-management standpoint:\nGains in the value of positions with one counterparty cannot be netted against losses in\nthe value of positions with other counterparties.\nBy taking one side of every trade, a central counterparty serves to transform the\nmesh network shown in panel A of figure 3 into something that looks more like the hub-\nand-spoke network illustrated in panel B. This network structure has no effect on the\nexposure of individual market participants to the assets or indexes underlying the\nderivatives contracts in question, but it dramatically simplifies and improves the\ntransparency of the network of counterparty risk exposures.17\nCentral clearing can yield important advantages over a fully bilateral market\nstructure. The simpler hub-and-spoke network structure is more transparent, and the\ncentral counterparty is well positioned to impose common margin requirements on all\nmarket participants. Central clearing facilitates the netting of gains and losses across\nmultiple market participants, which has the potential to significantly reduce each\nparticipant’s aggregate counterparty risk exposure. Rather than managing its\ncounterparty risk exposure to all other trading partners, a market participant needs to\nmanage only its exposure to the central counterparty. The central counterparty acts as a\n17\nFor clarity, figure 3, panel B, illustrates an idealized centrally cleared network in which only one central\ncounterparty clears all trades. In practice, it is entirely possible that more than one central counterparty\nmay accept a given class of contracts for clearing. Research by Darrell Duffie and Haoxiang Zhu, among\nothers, shows that central clearing exhibits significant economies of scale and scope (Duffie and Zhu,\n2011). As in other economic enterprises that exhibit strong positive network effects, the potential\nefficiency gains from consolidation in central clearing need to be appropriately weighed against the\ncountervailing benefits afforded by greater competition among central counterparties.\n\n- 16 -\npure intermediary and takes no net position in any of the underlying contracts that it\nclears, so it can experience losses only when a clearing member defaults and has posted\ninsufficient margin to cover the cost of replacing its open positions. Central\ncounterparties are typically designed to distribute any losses they do incur in a relatively\npredictable way across all clearing members. In this way, central clearing provides for a\ntransparent mutualization of counterparty risks among participants.\nCentral counterparties are designed to be narrowly focused on intermediation and\nnot the provision of credit and liquidity. This structure improves the chances that, in the\nevent of a significant market stress, market functioning will not be threatened by the\nfailure of market infrastructure itself.\nOf course, the other side of this coin is that adding a central counterparty\nintroduces a single point of failure for the network, making it critical that the central\ncounterparty itself be well managed and well regulated. To help ensure this result, title\nVII of the Dodd-Frank Act adopted stronger safeguards than in the past for central\ncounterparties that clear OTC derivatives. Title VIII aimed at strengthening the\nsupervision of financial market utilities, including central counterparties designated as\nsystemically important, by requiring annual examinations as well as ex ante reviews of\nmaterial rule and operational changes. In April 2012, the international organizations that\nset standards for financial market infrastructures such as central counterparties published\nnew and stronger standards for these entities. U.S. regulators, including the Federal\nReserve, participated actively in this work and are expected to make formal proposals for\nincorporating the new standards into U.S. regulations as soon as possible.\n\n- 17 -\nMore fundamentally, however, a central counterparty’s ability to manage risk is\ndetermined by its ability to accurately value the contracts it clears on a frequent and\npossibly real-time basis and to rapidly replace open positions at or near current prices in\nthe event that a clearing member defaults. Requiring less-liquid and highly customized\nderivatives to be cleared would likely increase systemic risks, as clearinghouses would\nnot be well positioned to manage the complex risks of such derivatives. The G-20\nmandate explicitly recognizes this important limitation on the benefits of central clearing,\nand it requires only that standardized OTC derivatives be centrally cleared. Accordingly,\nthe G-20 commitment has effectively managed the costs and benefits of central clearing\nin establishing a global clearing mandate.\nHowever, limiting central clearing to standardized derivatives means that a\nsignificant proportion of less standardized OTC contracts will continue to be written on a\nbilateral basis without the benefit of a central counterparty. The International Monetary\nFund estimates that one-third of interest rate and credit derivatives and two-thirds of\nequity, commodity, and foreign exchange derivatives will not be suited to standardization\nand will remain non-centrally cleared.18 As more-standardized derivatives migrate to\ncentral clearing, it will be important to remain vigilant in managing the risks from non-\ncentrally-cleared derivatives exposures.19 One important tool for managing the systemic\nrisks of non-centrally-cleared derivatives is margin requirements.20 Globally, regulators\nhave been working on standards for margin requirements on non-centrally-cleared\n18 See International Monetary Fund (2010).\n19 For example, participants and their supervisors will need to closely monitor the risk positions flowing\nfrom non-centrally-cleared derivatives to ensure that removing centrally cleared derivatives from existing\nbilateral netting arrangements will not inadvertently lead to significant growth in risk concentrations from\nnon-centrally-cleared derivatives.\n20 In addition to margin standards, enhanced capital standards prescribed by Basel 2.5 will serve as an\nimportant tool for managing systemic risk. See Bank for International Settlements (2009).\n\n- 18 -\nderivatives that would provide for harmonized rules and a level playing field, which is\ncrucial given the global nature of derivatives markets. In July, the Basel Committee and\nthe International Organization of Securities Commissions proposed a framework for\nmargin requirements on non-centrally-cleared derivatives.21 The finalized framework\nwill inform rulemakings of the Federal Reserve and other U.S. regulators.\nThe proposed framework would require financial firms and systemically\nimportant nonfinancial firms to collect two types of margin. First, they would be\nobligated to collect variation margin on a regular basis, so if a derivative loses market\nvalue, the party experiencing a loss must realize the loss immediately. This requirement\ncodifies current best market practice, since the largest derivatives dealers already\nexchange variation margin daily. However, and importantly, the framework extends this\nprudent risk-management practice to other derivatives counterparties. Requiring timely\npayment of variation margin will go a long way toward ensuring that an AIG-like event\nwill not happen again, since current exposures will not be allowed to build over time to\nunmanageable levels.22 Moreover, variation margin requirements will ensure that market\nparticipants will know that counterparties that they deal with will not be carrying large\nuncollateralized exposures that could impair their ability to perform in the future. Those\n21 See Bank for International Settlements (2012a).\n22 As documented by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, from 1998 to 2007, AIG, through its\nsubsidiary AIG Financial Products, built up huge indirect exposures to real-estate-backed debt by writing\nOTC credit protection on structured finance products, including mortgage-backed securities and\ncollateralized debt obligations that were in many cases ultimately backed by mortgages. Importantly,\nbecause AIG enjoyed a credit rating of AAA for much of this period, its derivatives counterparties did not\ntypically require it to post collateral at the time that new contracts were written. Rather, AIG agreed to post\ncollateral only if contracts fell in market value and AIG itself was downgraded. AIG was first downgraded\nto AA in the spring of 2005. It faced its first margin calls for credit default swaps covering mortgage-\nbacked collateralized debt obligations in mid-2007. Initially, AIG was able to delay or minimize the\ncollateral it had to post by disputing the contract valuations proposed by its counterparties. But as the\nbonds it had insured continued to fall in value and AIG was further downgraded, it faced increasing and\nultimately insurmountable collateral demands from its derivatives counterparties. For more information,\nsee Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (2011).\n\n- 19 -\nrequirements diminish the likelihood of the kind of information gridlock explored by\nCaballero and Simsek.\nMore controversially, the proposed framework requires the collection of initial\nmargin. While variation margin collateralizes current derivatives losses, initial margin\ncollateralizes future losses that could occur in the event of a counterparty’s default. In\nessence, initial margin is a kind of performance bond. In the event that a counterparty\ndoes not perform as required, the initial margin is used to replace the position with a new\ncounterparty.\nIt is here that some of the most significant policy tradeoffs arise, because higher\ninitial margin requirements will make it more costly for market participants to use\nderivatives to hedge risk. Liquid resources that are set aside as initial margin cannot be\ndeployed for other purposes. Given the sheer size and scope of derivatives markets,\nrequiring initial margin on all derivatives transactions could result in significant\nopportunity and liquidity costs. In a public comment letter to the Federal Reserve and\nother regulators, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association estimated that\ninitial margin requirements could lock up as much as $1.7 trillion in liquid assets\nglobally.23 This number is eye opening, to say the least. In an effort to better gauge the\nliquidity costs of initial margin requirements, the Federal Reserve, as part of the\ninternational group of prudential and market regulators that issued the July proposal, has\nconducted a detailed impact study to quantify the liquidity costs associated with initial\nmargin requirements. The results of this study, as well as comments received on the\nproposal, will help ensure that in the final framework, the need to reduce systemic risk is\nappropriately balanced against the resulting liquidity costs.\n23 See International Swaps and Derivatives Association (2012).\n\n- 20 -\nEven in light of the significant costs of initial margin, it seems clear that some\nrequirements are needed. The current use and application of initial margin is\ninconsistent, and a more robust and consistent margin regime for non-centrally-cleared\nderivatives will not only reduce systemic risk, but will also diminish the incentive to\ntinker with contract language as a way to evade clearing requirements. Robust and\nconsistent initial margin requirements will help prevent the kind of contagion that was\nsparked by AIG: They would serve, in effect, to limit the effects of interconnectedness\nwithin the financial network. The failure of a financial counterparty could be contained\nin the manner described by Allen and Gale. As I noted in connection with variation\nmargins, initial margin requirements would also improve transparency because derivative\nmarket participants will know that their counterparties are at least partially insulated from\ndefaults. Of course, these benefits need to be appropriately balanced against the burdens\nimposed by initial margin. But it seems highly unlikely that the status quo is consistent\nwith achieving the goals of the G-20 to reduce the potential for systemic risk in the OTC\nderivatives markets that could threaten the financial system.\nFinally, let me turn to data requirements. Both the research that I have\nhighlighted today and practical experience demonstrate that market, prudential, and\nsystemic risk authorities need detailed information on derivatives transactions and\nbilateral positions to assess evolving market risks and to execute their financial stability\nresponsibilities. Indeed, the Federal Reserve has already used preliminary information\nfrom the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation’s Trade Information Warehouse to\nconstruct network graphs of the CDS market such as the one illustrated in figure 4. The\ndata enable identification, for example, of firms, such as A and B in figure 4, that are\n\n- 21 -\nlarge net sellers of protection. Such information can play a valuable role in supervision.\nMoreover, the analyses for monitoring and measuring systemic risks suggested and\ndescribed by Gai, Haldane, and Kapadia and by Cont, Moussa, and Santos require this\nkind of detailed data to gain a holistic view of systemic risk.\nTitle VII of the Dodd-Frank Act requires that data on U.S. swaps transactions be\nreported to swaps data repositories regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading\nCommission or to securities-based swaps data repositories regulated by the Securities and\nExchange Commission. Similar European regulations impose trade reporting\nrequirements on swaps transacted in Europe. But there is still no guarantee, due to\nconfidentiality concerns and legal barriers to data sharing, that the data reported into\nthese trade repositories will ultimately be accessible to all of the regulators who require\nthe data to obtain a holistic view of the derivatives market. Given that the derivatives\nmarket is global in scope, access to those data is essential for authorities with systemic\nrisk responsibilities, such as the Federal Reserve, to monitor and respond to risks. To\nmake this point concrete, it is unclear whether we will be able, on a regular and\ncomprehensive basis, to produce the sort of analysis illustrated by figure 4. In order to\neffectively monitor market developments and systemic risks, it is crucial that regulators\nacross jurisdictions and countries share data on a consistent and regular basis.\nWhile better data and more transparency are important for monitoring and\nresponding to the buildup of systemic risks, we do, of course, also recognize the\nconfidentiality concerns. Information is a valuable resource to most financial market\nparticipants, and unnecessarily burdensome or overly revealing information disclosures\ncould compromise the position of market participants and reduce incentives for trade,\n\n- 22 -\nthus decreasing liquidity and market efficiency. Dodd-Frank’s real-time reporting\nrequirements for swaps transactions recognize this important point by allowing for\ndelayed reporting of large “block trades” where immediate reporting could reveal and\nundermine a participant’s position and ultimately discourage market transactions, depth,\nand liquidity. In this way, enhanced reporting and transparency requirements are being\nset to provide the public and regulators with useful information without compromising\nmarket integrity. Moreover, while market integrity and appropriate confidentiality are\nimportant considerations, the events of the financial crisis have clearly shown that\neffective systemic risk management demands more, and not less, data disclosure.\nConcluding Remarks\nI began this talk by describing the events surrounding the banking panic of 1907\nand the founding of the Federal Reserve. A lesson from that episode, as relevant today as\nit was then, was that financial stability is essential to sustained economic growth and\nprosperity. Just as the banking panic of 1907 revealed fundamental weaknesses in our\nfinancial system, so, too, did the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008. The recent crisis\nshowed that some financial innovations, over time, increased the system’s vulnerability\nto financial shocks that could be transmitted throughout the entire economy with\nimmediate and sustained consequences that we are still working through today. Some of\nthese vulnerabilities were a consequence of innovations that increased the complexity and\ninterconnectedness of aspects of the financial system. In response to the crisis and the\nweaknesses it revealed, governments around the globe are acting to improve financial\nstability and reduce the risks posed by a highly interconnected financial system. These\nefforts, of course, must account for the costs of new rules and ensure that these costs are\n\n- 23 -\nclearly outweighed by the benefits. I am confident that the policies I have described\ntoday will make the economy more resilient to financial shocks and help reduce the risk\nof another crisis, while properly balancing these important benefits against the necessary\ncosts.\nIn striking this balance, government has been guided by new research that has\nadded to our understanding of systemic risk. And this work continues. I have no doubt\nthat some of you here today will perform that research and make those discoveries. So,\nallow me to close by offering my thanks, in advance, for those contributions. I hope my\ntalk today has made it clear that the work of safeguarding our financial system will\ndepend on these efforts and insights, which will empower policymakers to make the right\ndecisions.\n\n- 24 -\nFigure 1\nGrowth in CDO and CDS Markets, 2000-11\nNote: CDO is collateralized debt obligation; CDS is credit default swap.

    "text": "Presentation to the Andrew Brimmer Policy Forum\nIBEFA/ASSA Meeting\nSan Francisco, CA\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on January 4, 2009, 2:30 PM Pacific, 5:30 PM Eastern\nU.S. Monetary Policy Objectives in the Short and Long Run1\nIntroduction\nToday the Federal Reserve faces some of the greatest challenges in its history as it strives to\nrestore economic growth, job creation, and financial stability and to preserve price stability. To\nachieve these policy objectives, the Federal Reserve is committed to using every tool at its\ndisposal.\nThe challenges are all too well known. Almost eighteen months since the onset of the now-\nglobal financial crisis, the functioning of financial markets remains greatly impaired, and\ndiminished credit flows are impeding the ability of households and firms to borrow and spend. As\na consequence, the U.S. economy is undergoing a sharp contraction, with almost two million jobs\nlost thus far and unemployment poised to rise further in the year ahead. And the adverse feedback\nloop goes on, as these deteriorating economic conditions, in turn, are intensifying financial sector\ndistress. Regarding price stability, pressures from soaring commodity prices at the onset of the\ncrisis have ebbed dramatically, and inflation is subsiding. Indeed, with growing economic slack,\ninflation may well decline, for a time, below levels that best promote the dual goals of full\nemployment and price stability.\nAn important lesson of theory and history is that circumstances like these call for prompt and\naggressive action. And the Federal Reserve has responded vigorously. Since September 2007, the\n1 The views expressed here are my own and do not necessarily represent those of my colleagues in the Federal\nReserve System. I would like to thank the staff of the San Francisco Fed’s Economic Research Department, and\nEric Swanson and John Judd in particular, for outstanding support in developing these remarks.\n1\n\nFOMC has cut the federal funds rate target roughly 500 basis points. In December, the Committee\ntook the historic final step of lowering the federal funds rate essentially to its “zero bound,”\nestablishing a target range of 0 to ¼ percent and communicating its expectation that weak\neconomic conditions would likely warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for\nsome time. This move exhausts the Fed’s ability to provide stimulus through “conventional”\nmonetary policy actions. But it by no means exhausts the Fed’s options to stimulate the economy\nthrough other measures. The Committee’s focus going forward will be on “non-conventional”\nprograms that use its balance sheet to improve the functioning of financial markets, an arena where\nconsiderable scope for action remains. In my remarks today, I will describe the balance sheet\nmeasures that the Fed has already put in place, addressing some frequently asked questions: Have\nthe programs worked? What is the scope for expanding these policies going forward? How does\nthe Fed’s approach compare to the quantitative easing policy implemented by the Bank of Japan\nbetween 2001 and 2006? I will also discuss the potential role that enhanced Fed communications\nmight play in helping to achieve both short- and long-run objectives.\nTo preview my answers, I will argue that the suite of programs that the Fed has already\nannounced or put in place are an appropriate and creative response to alleviate strains from the\nongoing credit crunch. The evidence suggests to me that they have improved liquidity in the\nmoney markets and lowered the cost of private credit. Going forward, asset purchases and lending\nprograms could be expanded and extended to additional sectors impacted by the credit crunch. As\nfor the comparison to Japan’s experience, to my mind, the differences outweigh the similarities.\nRoughly speaking, the Fed is focused on the potential for targeted programs on the “asset side” of\nits balance sheet to improve credit flows in specific impaired markets, whereas the Bank of Japan\nwas primarily focused on the potential for an expansion of the total quantity of its liabilities—the\nexcess reserves of the banking system—to spur additional bank lending.\n2\n\nThe Fed’s Balance Sheet Policies\nSince the onset of the crisis, the Fed has massively expanded the provision of liquidity to\nfinancial institutions, thereby easing the broader credit crunch. Serving as lender of last resort is a\ntime-honored function for central banks and is critical in mitigating systemic risk. But in doing so\nduring the current crisis, the Fed has crossed traditional boundaries by extending the maturity of\nthe loans, the range of acceptable collateral, and the range of eligible borrowing institutions. At\nthe onset of the crisis, the Fed encouraged banks to use the discount window. The apparent stigma\nassociated with use of the window, however, discouraged banks from borrowing. To address this\nproblem, the Fed introduced and has substantially expanded a new auction system (the Term\nAuction Facility or TAF) to distribute discount window loans. Auctions of longer-term (up to 84-\nday) loans at regular intervals were added to address a persistent shortage of term funding in the\nmoney markets, as evidenced, for example, by exceptionally high spreads of term versus overnight\nLibor loans. To further ease severe liquidity pressures at quarter- and year-end, the Fed introduced\na system of forward auctions on TAF loans. In addition, the Fed supported the provision of dollar\nliquidity beyond our own shores through a vast expansion of its network of swap lines with foreign\ncentral banks, raising the size of borrowing lines with existing swap partners and adding additional\ncentral banks to the network.\nA unique feature of the current financial crisis is that it has engulfed not only the banking\nsystem but also an enormous sector comprising the so-called “shadow banking system,” which\nincludes an array of non-bank financial institutions. It was apparent early on that confining the\nprovision of liquidity to depository institutions alone would be insufficient to meet the liquidity\nneeds of the broader financial markets. In response, the Fed invoked, for the first time since the\nGreat Depression, its authority under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act to lend in “unusual\n3\n\nand exigent circumstances” to “individuals, partnerships, or corporations” that are “unable to\nsecure adequate credit accommodations from other banking institutions.” Discount window\nlending under this authority was used to facilitate the acquisition of Bear Stearns and to stabilize\nAIG and Citigroup—three systemically important financial firms. It has also been invoked to\nestablish a discount window facility for primary dealers (the Primary Dealer Credit Facility or\nPDCF) and a new facility to enhance the ability of primary dealers to finance their securities\ninventories through the repo market. This Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF), through an\nauction mechanism, lends out Treasury securities from the Fed’s own holdings to primary dealers\nin exchange for investment grade securities. The facility, in effect, offers collateral to dealers for\nuse in repos that is more desirable in the market than most asset-backed securities.\nThe Fed’s use of its balance sheet to support the functioning of credit markets expanded\ndramatically following such events as the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and the near-collapse of\nAIG. Those events triggered severe disruptions in short-term money markets as investors in prime\nmoney market funds fled to the safety of the shortest Treasury securities. These disruptions also\ntriggered dysfunction in the commercial paper market, a large and important source of short-term\nfinancing for both financial and nonfinancial corporations. Two new facilities (the Asset-Backed\nCommercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF) and Money Market\nInvestor Funding Facility (MMIFF) were introduced to provide backup liquidity to money market\nmutual funds to help them cope with redemptions that could otherwise cause them to “break the\nbuck.” The AMLF provides nonrecourse discount window loans to banks to enable them to\npurchase asset-backed commercial paper from money market mutual funds, and the MMIFF\nprovides loans to a private-sector vehicle established to purchase a broad range of assets from\nthese funds.\n4\n\nIn order to restore functioning to the commercial paper market, the Fed has also committed to\nproviding loans to a new Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) that was set up to purchase\ncommercial paper from highly rated (A1P1) issuers. Importantly, the ultimate purpose of all of\nthese facilities is to enhance the provision of credit to a broad range of private borrowers by\nrestoring the liquidity and functioning of short-term money markets.\nIn my judgment, the suite of facilities that the Fed has created to improve money market\nconditions is working to satisfy the financial system’s greatly increased demand for safe assets and\nliquidity. Conditions are still abnormal, but money market functioning has clearly improved\nrelative to the dark days of last September and October. For example, term Libor rates have\ndeclined along with the spreads of these rates over the federal funds rate. Since term Libor rates\nare a benchmark for many adjustable-rate loans, including mortgages, the benefits of these\nreductions are rippling throughout the private sector. For highly rated commercial paper, eligible\nfor the CPFF, spreads have also narrowed substantially. In contrast, the borrowing spreads for less\nhighly rated paper (A2P2) remain extremely elevated.\nMoving beyond the money markets, interventions have only just begun, and considerable\nscope remains for targeted asset purchases and discount window lending programs to improve the\nflow of credit and reduce its cost in sectors that have been severely impacted by the financial crisis.\nIn November, the Fed announced and commenced a $600 billion program to purchase agency debt\nand agency-insured mortgage-backed securities. A successful initiative in this area could provide\nsignificant support to the housing sector. Scope remains for larger interventions, and in December\nthe FOMC reiterated its readiness to expand upon these purchases “as conditions warrant.” Even\nat this early stage, the program appears to be having an impact. For example, yields on mortgage-\nbacked securities and 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell substantially immediately after the program\n5\n\nwas announced. The decline in mortgage rates, which also has been affected by a decline in\nTreasury yields, has prompted an upsurge in refinancing activity in recent weeks. The FOMC\ncould also expand its purchases of longer-term Treasury debt—an initiative that could lower\ngovernment borrowing rates and spill over into private borrowing rates more broadly. In its\nDecember statement, the FOMC noted that it is evaluating the potential benefits of such purchases.\nThe Federal Reserve Act confines the System’s outright asset purchases to securities issued\nor guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. agencies. Even so, the Fed has the potential to use its\nbalance sheet to restore functioning in other impaired financial markets. The recently announced\nTerm Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) provides a model for doing so. This new Fed\nfacility is designed to spur lending to meet the credit needs of households and small businesses.\nThe facility will support the issuance of securities collateralized by auto, student, credit card, and\nSmall Business Administration (SBA) loans—sectors where the issuance of new securities has\nslowed to a trickle. The high borrowing spreads on such securities, even when the underlying\nloans are government-guaranteed—as in the case of SBA and many student loans—suggest not\nonly heightened credit risk but also an impairment of market liquidity which the facilities can\naddress. The inability of financial institutions to securitize such loans, and of potential investors in\nsuch securities to borrow against them on reasonable terms, reflects an important breakdown in\ncredit markets. By improving the functioning of markets for securitized assets, the Fed has the\npotential to boost private-sector credit flows in support of the economy. Under the TALF, which is\na joint Federal Reserve-Treasury initiative, the Fed has agreed to provide nonrecourse loans to\nholders of eligible highly rated asset-backed securities. Cooperation with the Treasury is necessary\nbecause the program entails some risk of loss and, under the Federal Reserve Act, all Fed lending\nmust be appropriately secured. The Treasury has committed $20 billion of TARP funds to protect\nthe Fed against losses on the Fed’s lending commitment of up to $200 billion.\n6\n\nThe approach employed by the TALF can be expanded substantially, with higher lending\nvolumes and additional asset classes covered by the program. Indeed, the Federal Reserve and the\nTreasury have announced that the facility could be expanded over time to include commercial and\nnon-agency residential mortgage-backed securities. Securitization activity in these markets has all\nbut dried up since the credit crisis began, and the shortage of credit in these critical sectors has\nmade private borrowing costs exceptionally high. Along these lines, the FOMC stated that it “will\ncontinue to consider ways of using its balance sheet to further support credit markets and economic\nactivity.”\nIt is worth noting that, as the nation’s central bank, the Fed can issue as much currency and\nbank reserves as required to finance these asset purchases and restore functioning to these markets.\nIndeed, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has already ballooned from about $900 billion at the\nbeginning of 2008 to more than $2.2 trillion currently—and is rising.\nThe Fed’s current “balance sheet approach” to monetary policy creates an entirely new set of\npolicy issues and challenges. For example, the Fed normally eschews interventions that directly\naffect the allocation of credit, and to a considerable extent, the new facilities rely on financial\nmarkets to channel funds to individual borrowers. However, the new facilities do influence credit\nallocation because they must be targeted at particular sectors of the credit market. In effect, the\nFed must judge where to intervene, deciding where market dysfunction is greatest and where\nadverse consequences for the overall economy are particularly severe. Furthermore, many of the\ninterventions are novel, so no straightforward methods are available to quantify their effectiveness.\nThere are also no clear guidelines for the Fed to gauge the appropriate size of its interventions and\nfew precedents for the Fed to use in communicating its policy stance to the public beyond\nannouncing new programs and describing their terms in detail. Although the purpose of most\nprograms is to lower borrowing costs, the Fed must be careful to avoid the risks that could result\n7\n\nfrom targeting some predetermined yield or spread. Finally, the Fed must ensure that it has an exit\nstrategy to wind down the facilities in a timely and effective way when they are no longer needed.\nThese challenges notwithstanding, I believe that the approaches I have described have considerable\npotential to contribute to a strong economic recovery.\nQuantitative Easing?\nOn the surface, it may seem appropriate to equate the Fed’s use of its balance sheet to\nstimulate the economy with the quantitative easing policy pursued earlier by the Bank of Japan.\nBut as I noted at the outset, the differences outweigh the similarities in my opinion. The main\nsimilarity is that the Fed, like the Bank of Japan, has increased the quantity of excess reserves in\nthe banking system well above the minimum level required to push overnight interbank lending\nrates to the vicinity of zero. The creation of such a large volume of excess reserves, in the Fed’s\ncase, results from the enormous expansion in the Fed’s discount window lending, foreign exchange\nswaps, and asset purchases. In the Bank of Japan’s case, the expansion in excess reserves resulted\nfrom the deliberate adoption of an explicit numerical target for them. The theory underlying the\nBank of Japan’s intervention was that banks might be encouraged to lend by replacing their\nholdings of short-term government securities with excess cash. The problem with this idea is that,\nnear the zero bound, short-term government securities and cash are almost perfect substitutes—\nboth are essentially riskless assets that yield a zero or near-zero rate of return; thus, exchanging one\nfor the other should have little effect on banks’ desire to lend. Indeed, the Japanese experience\nduring their quantitative easing program in the early 2000s suggests that simply expanding excess\nbank reserves—even by a very large amount—had little effect on bank lending or on the economy\nmore broadly. The policy may have lowered longer-term borrowing rates, however, by\nsymbolizing and highlighting the Bank of Japan’s commitment to fighting deflation by holding its\n8\n\nshort-term interest rate at zero for an extended time—until deflationary pressures had been\nconvincingly dissipated.\nIn contrast, the overall size of assets on the Fed’s balance sheet will be the result of decisions\nconcerning the appropriate scale of each particular program and the extent to which the various\nprograms and facilities are actually used by market participants. The take-up rates on these\nprograms and facilities are likely to fluctuate over time as market conditions change. For example,\nearly in a new Fed lending program, its impact on economic activity might rise with the associated\nexpansion of the Fed’s balance sheet. Later on, if the program helps to improve the functioning of\nthe private market, success could be associated with the contraction of the Fed’s balance sheet as\nthe Fed exits from the market, leaving the determination of credit flows to private participants.\nFurthermore, the mere availability of backup liquidity through a facility may improve market\nfunctioning, even if the volume of borrowing is low. Thus, the impact of the totality of Fed\nprograms should not be judged by the overall size of the Fed’s balance sheet. Rather, it will be\nnecessary to evaluate the success of each individual program in improving market function and\nfacilitating the flow of credit.\nFederal Reserve Communications\nAn extensive literature and some recent experience suggest that central bank communications\nmay also play a helpful role in addressing the constraints relating to the zero-bound. For example,\nDavid Reifschneider and John Williams (2000) and Gauti Eggertsson and Michael Woodford\n(2003) showed that the constraints imposed by the zero lower bound are not very restrictive if the\nFed can credibly commit to keeping the funds rate low for an extended period of time. The idea is\nthat the FOMC can work around the zero lower bound on the overnight interest rate by lowering\ninterest rate expectations in the future, thus pushing down longer-term interest rates to stimulate\nprivate spending. The Fed employed such an approach between 2003 and 2005, and has taken an\n9\n\nimportant step along the same path in its December announcement by stating that “exceptionally\nlow levels of the federal funds rate” are likely to be warranted “for some time” due to “weak\neconomic conditions.” I believe that such statements can play a useful role in more clearly\nindicating to markets the Committee’s own expectations concerning the federal funds rate path,\nconditional on the Committee’s economic forecast.\nCommunication also can be important in the Fed’s efforts to anchor long-term inflation\nexpectations. As I mentioned at the outset, the odds are high that over the next few years, inflation\nwill decline below desirable levels. It is especially important in such circumstances for the Fed to\nemphasize its commitment to returning inflation over time to the higher levels that are most\nappropriate to the attainment of its longer-term objectives. A decline in inflationary expectations\nwhen economic conditions are weak is pernicious, especially so when the federal funds rate has\nreached the zero bound, because any downdrift in inflation expectations leads to an updrift in real\ninterest rates and a tightening of financial conditions.\nWork by Refet Gürkaynak, Eric Swanson, and coauthors (2005, 2006) suggests that\ncommitting a central bank to a long-run inflation objective helps anchor longer-run inflation\nexpectations in that country. Over the past few years, the FOMC has in fact taken important\nincremental steps toward making its longer-term inflation goals more explicit. For example, we\nare now publishing FOMC members’ inflation forecasts for the next three years under the\nassumption of “appropriate monetary policy,” and the publication of such forecasts has helped\nshape public understanding concerning the range of inflation outcomes that FOMC members\nregard as desirable in the longer term. Looking forward, there could be scope for the Committee to\nimprove the clarity of these communications. I am optimistic that, by clearly communicating the\nFed’s commitment to low and stable inflation and by backing that commitment up with determined\n10\n\npolicy actions should the need arise, any deflationary pressures caused by the weak economy can\nbe contained.\nReferences\nEggertsson, Gauti, and Michael Woodford (2003), “The Zero Bound on Interest Rates and Optimal\nMonetary Policy,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity 2003(1), pp. 139-211.\nGürkaynak, Refet, Brian Sack, and Eric Swanson (2005), “The Sensitivity of Long-Term Interest\nRates to Economic News: Evidence and Implications for Macroeconomic Models,” American\nEconomic Review 95(1), pp. 425-436.\nGürkaynak, Refet, Andrew Levin, and Eric Swanson (2006), “Does Inflation Targeting Help\nAnchor Inflation Expectations?

    "text": "Speech to California Independent Bankers 16th Annual Convention\nLaguna Beach, California\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery October 9, 2006, 10:40 am Pacific, 1:40 pm Eastern\nProspects for the U.S. Economy\nGood morning, everyone, and many thanks for inviting me to join you at this\noutstanding conference. It’s always a pleasure for me to have the chance to meet with\ncommunity and regional bankers in the District. It’s also an opportunity, because getting\nto know your unique perspectives on conditions in your industry and in the economy\nhelps inform my own decisions in both the supervisory area and in monetary\npolicymaking. When I joined the San Francisco Fed two years ago, I was very glad to\nsee how seriously our staff takes its responsibility for supervising community banks. To\nmy mind, your institutions play a critical role in this country’s diverse and flexible\nbanking system: you provide essential services to your customers and make vital\ncontributions to the economic health not only of your communities but of the nation. So\nI’m delighted that we can show our support and commitment by participating in events\nlike this one.\nJoining me today from the San Francisco Fed is Steve Hoffman, Senior Vice\nPresident of Banking Supervision and Regulation. Tomorrow, Jose Alonso, Director of\nRegional and Community Banking in our Los Angeles Branch, will represent the Fed\nduring the regulatory panel discussion of commercial real estate. For the question and\nanswer session following my remarks, I’ll defer to Steve for addressing any technical\nsupervision questions that you might have.\n1\n\nAlthough I will touch on some supervisory topics today, my remarks overall will\ncover my outlook for the U.S. economy and inflation. Before I begin, let me note that my\ncomments represent my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the\nFederal Reserve System. One of the main things I want to focus on is what this outlook\nimplies for monetary policy, and, in particular, I’ll discuss the decision at the last meeting\nof the Federal Open Market Committee. As you know, that was the second consecutive\ntime that the Committee decided to hold the federal funds rate at 5¼ percent, after having\nraised it by one-quarter percentage point at each of the prior seventeen meetings. So my\nplan is to go into some of my reasoning for supporting the approach underlying that\ndecision.\nTo do that, I need to step back a little in time, because where the economy is now\nand where I think it is headed have a lot to do with how we got here in the first place.\nLet me take you back to mid-2004, when the Fed first began to raise the federal funds\nrate. This move followed a long period—about a year and a half—of holding the rate at a\nvery low 1 to 1¼ percent to provide the stimulus needed to reduce the risk of outright\ndeflation. Eventually, that stimulus, together with the general resilience of our economic\nsystem, did help the economy pick up steam. By June of 2004, the threat of deflation had\npassed, and it was time to start removing monetary stimulus. And, as I said, that’s what\nthe Committee did, one quarter-percentage-point step at a time. In fact, if you chart the\npath of the funds rate since then, it looks a lot like a staircase, or, as some have dubbed it,\nan escalator. Over the course of much of this time, the economy averaged solid growth—\nor even better than solid growth; in fact, the economy was growing at a pace that was\nnoticeably higher than estimates of the rate it can sustain in the long run.\n2\n\nWith this strong performance, we also have seen the slack in labor and product\nmarkets dwindle. For example, the civilian unemployment rate dropped by 1 percentage\npoint to 4.6 percent in September. This rate is a bit lower than conventional estimates of\nso-called “full employment” and, therefore, suggests that by now labor markets may even\nhave moved a bit to the tight side.\nAt the same time, inflation rose, and it has been higher for some time now than I\nlike to see it—not only headline inflation, but also the core measure, which excludes the\nvolatile food and energy components. The particular inflation measure the Committee\nfocuses on in its Monetary Policy Report to Congress is the core personal consumption\nexpenditures price index. Over the past year, it rose at nearly a 2½ percent rate.\nAlthough I’m somewhat encouraged that various measures of core inflation have edged\ndown recently, it’s clear that more progress is needed.\nAt the August meeting, it seemed that the signs of a slowdown in economic\nactivity were starting to show up, at least in part because of the Fed’s previous efforts to\nremove monetary accommodation. Inflationary pressures also seemed reasonably likely\nto gradually abate. So, at that time, the Committee decided to pause—to “step off the\nescalator” and wait a while to see how the previous funds rate increases and other\ninfluences on the economy were playing out. Since then, there have been further signs of\nslowing, and at the September meeting, the Committee again decided in favor of a\npause—to “stay on the landing,” so to speak, leaving the funds rate at 5¼ percent.\nProspects for Economic Activity\nNow that I’ve covered how we got here, the questions are, where are we exactly,\nand what is the likely outlook for economic activity and inflation?\n3\n\nFirst, the economy. As I mentioned, the data we’ve been seeing in recent months\npoint to a noticeable slowdown for this half of the year, with growth running at only a\nmodest pace and clearly below the rate that is sustainable in the long run. Naturally,\nthere are forces both supporting growth and restraining it, so let me enumerate some of\nthem here.\nThe factors working to support growth include ongoing strength in business\ndemand, fueling relatively rapid growth in spending on business investment in equipment\nand software, including the important high-tech industries. Moreover, spending for the\nconstruction of nonresidential structures has advanced smartly so far this year, and\npromises to remain strong for a while longer. For example, outlays on drilling and\nmining structures have continued to increase in response to oil prices that are still high\nand expected to remain so. Furthermore, fundamentals in commercial real estate markets\ncontinued to improve this year, increasing demand for commercial space from office\nparks to warehouses. Indeed, here in Southern California, for example, office vacancy\nrates in Los Angeles, Orange County, and Riverside Counties are at or near 10-year lows.\nGoing forward, even at a more moderate pace of economic expansion, private forecasters\nexpect the positive trends in commercial real estate in both California and the nation to\ncontinue but to moderate next year as capacity comes online.\nNow for the factors that are likely to restrain the nation’s economic growth. One\nobvious factor, of course, is energy prices. It is quite likely that the surge in the price of\noil over the past couple of years has taken a bite out of consumer spending, even if other\nfactors, like growth of jobs, wages, and wealth, have kept consumption moving up\noverall.\n4\n\nNeedless to say, it has been something of a relief to see that oil prices have\nreceded quite a bit in recent months, probably because threats to supply from the Middle\nEast conflict and from the Gulf Coast hurricane season have eased. At this point, futures\nmarkets expect them to stabilize around the current lower levels, and if they do, the\nrestraint we’ve felt this year should evaporate over 2007; in fact, stable oil prices would\nactually contribute to a pickup in growth next year. Of course, given the well known\nvolatility of energy markets, that’s a very big “if,” so they remain a wild card in the\noutlook as usual.\nThe high price of oil is also hitting the auto industry, in particular, U.S. auto\nproduction, and that is another factor working to slow our economy. People aren’t just\ngroaning every time they pump gas and watch the numbers roll up and up, they’re also\nlooking for more fuel-efficient vehicles. That’s good news for some of the foreign\nautomakers, but not such good news for some U.S. producers, for whom SUVs and trucks\nhave been a key source of strength. As the demand for these vehicles has dropped pretty\nsharply, producers find themselves holding unsustainably high inventories. So it’s little\nwonder that we should have read recently about Ford or GM offering buyouts to their\nemployees as they move to ramp down production. These production cuts will likely\nslow overall real GDP growth in the U.S. until the adjustment to a lower level is reached,\nmost likely next year.\nAnother factor restraining growth is the rise in interest rates over the past couple\nof years as the Fed has removed monetary policy accommodation. Since this process\nbegan in mid-2004, short- and intermediate-term interest rates are up substantially.\nLong-term rates present a more mixed picture, with some—such as conventional\n5\n\nmortgage rates—up slightly, and others actually lower than before. Nonetheless, the\noverall effect of these rate changes should be to reduce demand, particularly in interest-\nsensitive sectors.\nOf course, housing is a particularly interest-sensitive sector, and, as we know, it\nalready has shown clear signs of cooling. Frankly, the pace of it has been a little\nsurprising. Nationally, housing permits are down noticeably—by about 22 percent—\nfrom a year ago. In addition, inventories of unsold houses are up significantly, sales of\nnew and existing homes are off their peaks, and surveys of homebuyers and builders are\nshowing much more pessimistic attitudes.\nThe national data on residential investment reflect all of these developments and\nenter directly into the calculation of real GDP growth. After adjusting for inflation, (real)\nresidential investment dropped at an 11 percent annual rate in the second quarter\nfollowing two small declines in the prior two quarters.\nThe California data, not surprisingly, show even more softening in the housing\nmarket. For the first half of this year, quarterly average home sales in California are\ndown nearly four times as much as they are nationwide, and new housing activity also\nhas slowed more dramatically in the state.\nAccording to some of our contacts elsewhere in this Federal Reserve District, data\nlike these are actually “behind the curve,” and they’re willing to bet that things will get\nworse before they get better. For example, a major home builder has told me that the\nshare of unsold homes has topped 80 percent in some of the new subdivisions around\nPhoenix and Las Vegas, which he labeled the new “ghost towns” of the West. Though\nthe situation isn’t that bad everywhere, a significant buildup of home inventory implies\n6\n\nthat permits and starts may continue to fall and the market may not recover for several\nyears. While builders remain hesitant to cut prices so far, and instead offer sales\nincentives, price cuts at some point in the future seem almost inevitable.\nIndeed, we have already seen that the pace of house-price appreciation has clearly\nmoderated, and there are signs that it may continue. For example, one indicator we have\nbeen following is the Case-Shiller house price index, which is based on house price data\nin ten large urban markets—three of which are in California, by the way. Beginning in\nMay of this year, futures contracts on this price index began trading, and they show house\nprices falling at about a 6 percent annual rate by the end of this year. Though this is still\na very new and pretty thin market, the results are interesting and suggestive.\nSignificant movements in house prices can be an issue for economic activity. Just\nas the run-up in house prices provided some support for consumer spending, slower\nincreases, and especially outright decreases, could weaken that support. For example,\nback when house prices were rising so fast, people saw that more and more equity was\nbeing built up in their houses, and they might well have felt that they could afford to\nspend pretty freely. In economic terms, this is called the “wealth effect.” In addition,\nwith instruments like home equity loans, refinancing, and so on, households have found it\nmuch easier to pull money out of their rising house values to support their spending.\nNow, with the pace of house-price appreciation slowing, of course, their equity is not\nrising so fast anymore, which may weaken the growth in consumer spending. In\nCalifornia, the impact of a vanishing wealth effect might be quite significant because\nover the past year the state has seen a more rapid deceleration in housing prices than the\nnation.\n7\n\nBefore I turn to the prospects for inflation, I’d like to spend a few minutes\ndiscussing the outlook for both residential and commercial real estate in the context of the\ncurrent regulatory focus on the banking industry’s lending to these sectors of the\neconomy.\nIn fact, the San Francisco Fed has a long-standing supervisory interest in real\nestate conditions. We helped shape the current draft interagency guidance on commercial\nreal estate concentrations, and our institutional memory of the devastating California real\nestate downturn in the early 1990s remains vivid. Frankly, it would be hard to forget that\nperiod, when California had 49 commercial bank failures between 1991 and 1996,\naccounting for about 11 percent of the state’s banks. The vast majority—as well as many\nbanks that survived in troubled condition—had very high construction loan\nconcentrations for either commercial or residential properties, or both.\nOf course, circumstances have changed a lot since then. For example, there is\nnow ready access to information on real estate market conditions and active secondary\nmarkets for real estate loans; and certainly, bank underwriting practices have improved\nsignificantly. While these changes have helped to mitigate risk, we can’t afford to\nbecome complacent; as history has taught us, concentrations still can prove dangerous\nwhen market conditions turn.\nAs you know, the performance of commercial real estate and construction loans\non banks’ balance sheets has been excellent, largely because of low interest rates and\nsubstantial appreciation of property values. These conditions may have encouraged\nbanks to focus new lending towards these sectors—especially construction and land\ndevelopment. Although California banks no longer lead the nation in construction loan\n8\n\nconcentrations – as they did in the previous real estate cycle – more than 40 percent of\nthe state’s banks exceed the benchmark ratio contained in the draft interagency guidance,\nwhich, as you know, is 100 percent of total capital.\nConstruction lending causes some concern at this point in the cycle because our\nexaminers have found that much of the recent loan growth in community and regional\nbanks is in the softening residential market. The riskiest loans are those for land\nacquisition and speculative development; historically, these are the first to register the\neffects of a slowdown in terms of weakening demand for new loans and declining quality\nof existing loans. If housing markets continue to slow, such banks should watch closely\nfor signs of trouble, such as project delays, houses not selling, price discounts, condos\nconverting to rentals, and increasing loan renewals, extensions, and refinancings. Any of\nthese developments could have a significant impact on revenue and growth projections as\nwell as loan losses at some banks.\nAs the draft interagency guidance states, we expect banks to actively manage risk\nconcentrations in commercial real estate and construction lending. Tomorrow, Jose will\ndiscuss some of the ways that banks are enhancing their approach to credit risk\nconcentration management. Based on what we’ve seen in recent examinations, I’m\npleased to say that it appears that a number of banks have already implemented most of\nthe risk management practices outlined in the proposed guidance.\nProspects for Inflation\nNow let me return to the national outlook and focus on inflation. As I’ve\nindicated, core consumer inflation has been uncomfortably high recently. Therefore, in\nkeeping with the Committee’s responsibilities for promoting price stability for the nation,\n9\n\nI believe it is critical that inflation trend in a downward direction over the medium term.\nIndeed, my expectation is that this is the most likely outcome for several reasons.\nFirst, as I’ve explained, the economy appears to have entered a period of below-\ntrend growth. If this continues for a time, as I think is likely, the tightness we have seen\nin labor and product markets would ease somewhat, tending gradually to reverse any\nunderlying inflationary pressures.\nA second reason to expect inflationary pressures to lessen has to do with the\nimpact of stabilizing, or even falling, oil prices on core inflation. As I mentioned, core\ninflation, by definition, excludes energy prices, but energy prices may affect core\ninflation to the extent that they affect the prices of other goods and services. For\nexample, transport companies might raise their prices to pass along the higher costs of\nfilling their trucks’ gas tanks. This is known as “passthrough,” and it is likely that it has\nplayed at least some role in recent core inflation movements. Now that energy prices\nhave fallen a fair bit from recent highs and are expected by futures markets to remain at\nthose lower levels, this upward pressure on core inflation is likely to dissipate and could\neven turn into modest downward pressure at some point.\nBut let me note that we shouldn’t exaggerate the importance of this point. Recent\nanalysis suggests that the extent of passthrough for any given rise in energy prices has\nbeen lower in the past twenty-five years than it was back in the 1970s.1 For a specific\nexample, consider airfares, which have increased markedly over the past year.\nConsidering that jet fuel accounts for one-eighth to one-fourth of airlines’ operating\ncosts, it would make sense to think they have passed through higher fuel prices into\n1 Mark Hooker, “Are Oil Shocks Inflationary? Asymmetric and Nonlinear Specifications versus Changes\nin Regime,” Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking, May 2002.\n10\n\nairfare increases. However, some simple calculations show that the cost increases from\nrising jet fuel are likely insufficient to explain more than a portion of the airfare\nincreases, and that higher load factors are likely to be part of the explanation.\nThe final reason to be optimistic about inflation moving lower is that inflation\nexpectations appear to have been well anchored over the past ten years or so as the Fed\nhas established its credibility with the public about both its commitment to and its\ncompetence in keeping inflation at low and stable rates. For example, in the face of the\nlarge oil price increases we’ve seen in recent years, this credibility shows up in the\nstability of survey and market measures of inflation expectations looking ten years\nahead.2\nStatistical analysis of the behavior of core inflation over time also lends some\nsupport to the view that inflation expectations are well anchored. In such statistical\nanalyses, the inflation data historically have exhibited persistence. This basically means\nthat, when you’re forecasting inflation, it works pretty well to assume that the rate in the\nfuture will be the same as it is today. The implication of persistence is frankly\nworrisome: Since inflation is too high today, persistence implies it could stay too high\nfor an extended period.\nHowever, research suggests that if a central bank’s commitment to price stability\nhas gained credibility with the public, then the persistence observed in the inflation data\nwill tend to be dampened. And as it turns out, recent research at the Federal Reserve\n2 Bharat Trehan with Jason Tjosvold, “Inflation Targets and Inflation Expectations: Some Evidence from\nthe Recent Oil Shocks,” FRBSF Economic Letter, number 2006-22, September 1, 2006.\nhttp://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2006/el2006-22.html\n11\n\nBank of San Francisco finds less evidence of persistence during the past ten years.3 That\nis, rather than sticking at a certain rate, core inflation has tended to revert to its long-run\naverage, which, over that period, is between 1-1/2 to 2 percent. Admittedly, the past ten\nyears constitute a relatively small sample from which to draw definitive conclusions.\nNonetheless, this evidence is important because, if it holds up, it implies that inflation\nmay move down from its elevated level faster than many forecasters expect.\nI would like to stress that a finding of low persistence in inflation is no reason for\nthe Fed to rest on its laurels of credibility. Rather, credibility is something that neither\nI—nor my colleagues—take for granted for a moment. We know full well that\nmaintaining credibility requires that we act when necessary to keep inflation under\ncontrol.\nSo, in summary, I think there are a number of reasons to expect core inflation to\ntrend gradually lower in the future. However, I am keenly aware that this pattern has yet\nto show up in the data on any sort of a sustained basis. The inflation outlook remains\nhighly uncertain, and until we actually see inflation begin to slow down, I will be focused\non the upside risks in the outlook.\nPolicy issues\nThis leads me back to where I began—monetary policy and the Committee’s\ndecisions at the last two meetings to pause for a time after 17 quarter-point rate hikes in a\nrow. Why does a pause make sense to me now, while at the same time I say I’m worried\nthat inflation is too high? My answer is that I do want to see inflation move down, but I\n3 John C. Williams, “The Phillips Curve in an Era of Well-Anchored Inflation Expectations,” unpublished\npaper, http://www.frbsf.org/economics/economists/staff.php?jwilliams. A less technical version with the\nsame title is forthcoming as FRBSF Economic Letter 2006-27 (October 13, 2006)\nhttp://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/\n12\n\nbelieve policy may now be well-positioned to foster exactly such an outcome while also\ngiving due consideration to the risks to economic activity.\nThe stance of policy can be assessed by a variety of metrics. These measures\ninclude the forecast I have outlined today, as well as the recommendations from\ncommonly used monetary policy rules. Taken as a whole, such rules—often referred to\nas Taylor rules—indicate that the funds rate is currently within the moderately restrictive\nrange that appears appropriate,\nIf policy is now well positioned, it will still take time for inflation to unwind due\nto lags between policy actions and their impacts on economic activity and inflation.\nThese lags can be anywhere from several months to a couple of years. This means that\nwe have yet to see the full effects of the series of 17 funds rate increases—some are\nprobably still in the pipeline.\nYou will note that I am casting my statements about the stance of policy and the\noutlook in very conditional terms. I do this because of the great uncertainty that\nsurrounds these issues. Frankly, all approaches to assessing the stance of policy are\ninherently imprecise. Just as imprecise is our understanding of how long the lags will be\nbetween our policy actions and their impacts on the economy and inflation. This\nuncertainty argues, then, for policy to be responsive to the data as it emerges, especially\nas we get within range of the desired policy setting. The decision to pause allows us\nmore time to observe the data so that appropriate adjustments can be made over time.\nFor example, with the passage of time, we will gain more information on whether we\nhave done enough to assure that inflation moves gradually lower.\n13\n\nIn summary, monetary policymakers again are doing a balancing act, seeking the\nbest way to temper inflationary pressures while not exposing the business cycle\nexpansion to undue risk. Holding the stance of policy steady for a time makes sense to\nme. First, we appear to be within range of the moderately restrictive policy setting that\nseems appropriate. Second, pausing gives us time to observe the effects of previous\npolicy actions and other factors to allow for adjustments to the policy setting that will\nkeep us moving toward the desired outcome for inflation, output, and employment.\nBefore I start to take questions, I’d like to thank you for your kind attention, and\nI’d also like to thank the California Independent Bankers Association again for having\nme here today. The connection we have built with community bankers over the years is\nvery important to the mission of the San Francisco Fed. As president, it also is very\nimportant to me, and I am personally committed to playing my part in building on our\nalready strong relationships.\n14",

    "text": "Speech to the Arizona Council on Economic Education\nScottsdale, Arizona\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery January 17, 2007, 12:50 PM Mountain Time, 2:50 PM Eastern\nThe U.S. Economy in 2007: Prospects and Puzzles\nGood afternoon, everyone. It's a pleasure to be here in Scottsdale, and it’s a\nspecial pleasure to have the chance to speak before the Arizona Council on Economic\nEducation. As President of the San Francisco Fed, I wholeheartedly support the role our\nBank plays as a “key partner” in your efforts. The San Francisco Fed and, I should add,\nthe whole Federal Reserve System, place high priority on economic education and our\npartnership with the Council is part of a range of programs and activities to inform and\ninstruct the public on economic issues. The Fed’s emphasis on economic education\nreflects our recognition that wise financial planning and decisionmaking are critical to\nany individual's economic security. Beyond that, we recognize that an economically\ninformed public is critical to our mission in monetary policy.\nOf course, even if I were not a Reserve Bank President, I still would applaud your\nefforts. As you know, I share with you a long history of being an economics educator\nmyself, although my work has been with students at the undergraduate and graduate\nlevels and not in the grade schools. In fact, I have heard about the new mandated\neconomics curriculum for K-12 students in Arizona, and it looks pretty ambitious—\nintroducing the concept of opportunity costs to third-graders, for example! It makes me\nthink how much easier my job at Berkeley might have been if more of my students had\nhad a grasp of such concepts before they walked into my class!\n\nToday I’m going to speak to you not as a professor, but as a national monetary\npolicymaker. So my discussion will center on recent developments affecting\nemployment, output, and inflation in the U.S. economy and what they may portend for\nthe future and especially for the conduct of monetary policy. In doing so, I will spend\nsome time focusing on an emerging puzzle in the data: why is the labor market\napparently going gangbusters, while growth in real GDP has turned in only a middling\nperformance on average in recent quarters?\nBefore I begin, let me note that my comments represent my own views and not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nIn describing the economy’s recent growth performance as “middling,” as I just\ndid, I was not making a pejorative judgment. On the contrary, this relatively modest pace\nof growth is roughly what I would have expected, given the course of monetary policy.\nAs you no doubt remember, the Federal Open Market Committee began to remove\nmonetary stimulus in mid-2004, after a long stretch of keeping the federal funds rate—\nour main policy tool—at a very low level. Altogether, there were 17 quarter-point\nincreases in the funds rate over about two years. During much of that time, the economy\naveraged solid growth, and the labor market tightened, with unemployment declining\nabout a full percentage point to 4.5 percent, an exceptionally low level by historical\nstandards. The object of the policy tightening was to slow the economy’s growth to a\nmore sustainable pace and to foster a gradual decline in inflation, promoting price\nstability. In August of last year, the Committee voted to “pause,” that is, not to raise the\nfunds rate another quarter point, but to leave it at 5¼ percent. By then, some of the\n\neffects of the earlier increases were being felt, as the economy showed signs of slowing,\nand this gave some sense of reassurance that inflation was likely to moderate from an\nelevated level. The aim of these policy moves, to my mind, at least, was thus to set the\neconomy on a glide path for the proverbial “soft landing”—an orderly slowing of growth\nthat avoids the risk of a severe downturn while producing enough slack in labor and\ngoods markets to relieve inflationary pressures and, indeed, to bring inflation down\ngradually to a more acceptable level than it has registered over the prior year or so.\nIn large measure, the economy has moved within range of this outcome. Since\nthe stepwise increases in the funds rate began, short- and intermediate-term interest rates\nhave risen substantially. For example, Treasury bill rates are up by more than 3½\npercentage points from mid-2004. It’s true that long-term rates, including conventional\nmortgages, are actually down a bit over this period. However, variable mortgage rates\nhave risen along with short-term rates.\nThe overall effect of such rate changes has been to reduce demand. For example,\nalthough long-term fixed mortgage rates have not changed much, the rise in variable\nmortgage rates probably has contributed to the housing downturn, which has been a drag\non the economy. I should note, however, that interest rates are not the only culprit. It’s\nlikely that the recent cooling also is a necessary correction after years of rapid run-ups in\nhouse prices that ultimately proved to be unsustainable. Nationally, housing permits are\ndown by more than 30 percent from a year ago, and inventories of unsold houses are up\nsignificantly. The national data on residential investment reflect these developments and\nenter directly into the calculation of real GDP growth. After adjusting for inflation, (real)\n\nresidential investment registered its fourth straight decline in the third quarter, which held\noverall real GDP growth down by a substantial 1¼ percentage points. The partial data\nwe have on the fourth quarter suggests that there was a similar effect then.\nWhile the decline in housing activity has been significant and will probably\ncontinue for a while longer, I think the concerns we used to hear about the possibility of a\ndevastating collapse—one that might be big enough to cause a recession in the U.S.\neconomy—have been largely allayed. As I mentioned, long-term rates have remained\nlow, and that has helped to cushion the downturn in housing activity. Likewise, the fears\nabout plummeting house prices have not materialized at the national level, though some\npockets of the country have seen house prices actually decline. Phoenix provides a\nstriking example of how the market has turned around: sales cancellations have been\nrampant on new homes, and, after rising about 40%-50% in 2005, in 2006 prices on\nexisting homes flattened out and perhaps even declined a bit by the end of the year. It\nwould not surprise me to learn that some of you have directly observed recent price\ndeclines in this area. But for the country as a whole, house prices have continued to\nappreciate, though obviously at a much more moderate rate than they did earlier. The\nconcern here was that a significant fall in the prices of houses, which make up such a\nsignificant part of so many people’s wealth, could lead to a weakening in consumer\nspending. Since consumption expenditures represent two-thirds of real GDP, even\nrelatively modest effects of declining housing wealth could put a noticeable dent in\noverall economic activity. While slower house price appreciation is undoubtedly\nimparting less impetus to consumer spending now than during the years of rapid run-ups,\nconsumer spending remains solid overall, outpacing real GDP growth in the second half\n\nof last year. We have seen few signs of substantial negative spillovers from weakness in\nhousing markets to consumer spending.\nLooking at other sectors of the economy, we see a pretty robust picture, for the\nmost part. Business demand has been solid, fueled by high profits and relatively\nfavorable financing conditions, leading to healthy growth in spending on business\ninvestment in equipment and software, especially in the high-tech industries. Moreover,\nspending for the construction of nonresidential structures advanced smartly last year, and\npromises to remain robust for a while longer. For example, outlays on drilling and\nmining structures have continued to increase in response to oil prices that are still high by\nhistorical standards, though the pace of investment is moderating. Furthermore,\nfundamentals in commercial real estate markets improved last year, increasing demand\nfor commercial space from office parks to warehouses. Going forward, even at a more\nmoderate pace of economic expansion, private forecasters expect the positive trends in\ncommercial real estate to continue but to moderate over the year as capacity comes\nonline.\nIn addition to housing, auto production has been a drag on the economy during\nthe past few quarters. The auto industry has felt the effects of high oil prices and people’s\ngrowing preferences for more fuel-efficient vehicles. That has been good news for some\nof the foreign automakers, but not such good news for some U.S. automakers, for whom\nSUVs and trucks have been a key source of strength. As the demand for these vehicles\ndropped, producers found themselves holding unsustainably high inventories. So it's\nlittle wonder that they moved to ramp down production. These production cuts slowed\n\noverall real GDP growth in the U.S. in 2006. However, once the adjustment to a lower\nlevel of inventories is reached, probably in the not too distant future, this factor will cease\nto hold down growth in the U.S. economy.\nIn fact, energy prices themselves could be a source of support for growth this\nyear. Over the past couple of years, the surge in the price of oil took a bite out of\nconsumer spending, even though other factors, like growth of jobs, wages, and wealth,\nkept consumption moving up overall. Needless to say, it has been a relief to see that oil\nprices have not just stabilized but actually receded quite a bit since their peak in the\nmiddle of last year. At this point, futures markets expect them to stabilize around the\ncurrent lower levels, and if they do, not only should the restraint we felt last year\nevaporate this year; the decline in oil prices would actually contribute to a pickup in\ngrowth. Of course, given the well-known volatility of energy markets, that's a very big\n\"if,\" so they remain a wild card in the outlook as usual.\nSo, to sum up the story on output, real GDP advanced at moderate rates of only\n2½ and 2 percent in the second and third quarters of last year. Recent monthly data have\nboosted estimates of growth in the fourth quarter, but such high frequency data can be\nvolatile, and very recent developments don’t change my overall assessment that\neconomic activity is proceeding at a moderate underlying pace. In other words, it looks\nas if the economy is pretty close to the “glide path” I mentioned before—growth has\nslowed to a bit below most estimates of the economy’s long-run potential, while the risk\nof an outright downturn has receded.\n\nThat would all be very comforting, except for the puzzle I mentioned at the\nbeginning, which could have serious implications for inflation and, therefore, for the\n“soft landing” I’m hoping for. Just to restate the puzzle: if the economy is growing a bit\nbelow its long-run trend, why is the labor market going gangbusters? It is as if the\nBureau of Economic Analysis, which produces the GDP data, hasn’t delivered its\nmessage to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The latest labor-market data show payroll\nemployment growing steadily and at a rather robust pace. Moreover, the unemployment\nrate has declined by ½ percentage point over the past year and now stands at 4½ percent;\nthat rate suggests a degree of tightness in the labor market, because it is somewhat below\ncommon estimates of the rate that can be sustained in the long run without generating\nrising inflation. Using a standard rule of thumb, the unemployment rate should have been\nessentially unchanged, given the 3 percent growth rate the economy has averaged over\nthe past four quarters.\nThe ramifications of this puzzle are significant. If labor markets are as tight as the\nunemployment rate suggests, then there may be reason for concern about building\ninflationary pressures. If, on the other hand, they are not, then it is more likely that we\nare headed for a “soft landing.”\nLet me start with the worrisome possibilities, in which the puzzle could indicate\nbuilding inflationary pressures. One such possibility is that the apparent disconnect\nbetween labor markets and output reflects a misreading of how close output is to its long-\nrun capacity. This could happen because the economy’s long-run capacity may actually\nbe lower than many estimates. It also could happen if output is actually growing faster\n\nthan the data show. In fact, there are indications to that effect, namely, that actual output\ngrowth may have been faster than the pace reflected in measured GDP.\nAggregate statistics on the U.S. economy are calculated in two ways—we have\nmeasurements of total output and separate measurements of total income. In principle,\nthese must be the same—every dollar of output generates a dollar of income for some\neconomic entity, be it an individual or a firm. However, in practice, the statistical\nsources for output and income are different, so that the two measurements need not come\nout to the same aggregate number. This difference is known as the “statistical\ndiscrepancy,” a topic that tends to put even economists to sleep. However, I raise this\nobscure issue because it could have important implications.\nGrowth in gross domestic income has outpaced growth in gross domestic product\nby a whopping three-quarters of a percentage point over the past year. If the income\nmeasure ends up being more accurate than the output measure, then the decline in the\nunemployment rate this year would not be surprising at all. Indeed, this would mean that\nboth labor and product markets have been tight, which would add to our estimate of\ninflation pressures.\nNow let me turn to the more benign possibilities, that is, where labor markets may\nnot be signaling growing inflationary pressures. One possibility is that the disconnect\nbetween the unemployment rate and output growth will be resolved by a little more\npatience. Labor markets adjust to output growth with a lag, and that lag is not always\nconsistent over time. So we may just need a little more time for the standard relationship\n\nto reassert itself, with increases in unemployment that reestablish the normal relationship\nwith the slower rate of growth we’ve seen.\nAnother possibility is that even after the lags have worked themselves out, the\nunemployment rate may be overstating the tightness of labor markets. One form of\nevidence for this is that certain other labor market indicators suggest a bit of softening.\nIn particular, the Conference Board index of job market perceptions, which is based on a\nsurvey of households, declined in both October and November. This index is historically\nvery highly correlated with the unemployment rate, but now it is sending a different\nsignal, suggesting that labor markets are roughly in balance, not tight. Similarly, in\nNovember, fewer firms reported openings that are hard to fill.\nAnother form of evidence bearing on this benign interpretation relates to labor\ncompensation. If labor markets are tight, one would expect that labor compensation—\nincluding both wages and benefits—would be rising rapidly. However, the available\ninformation on this provides a mixed, and, I must admit, a somewhat confusing picture.\nWe have two broad measures of labor compensation. One, the employment cost index, is\nshowing remarkably restrained increases of only 3 percent over the past year, about the\nsame as in the prior year, and this development would seem to belie tight labor markets.\nThe other measure, compensation per hour, gives a higher reading of more than 4¼\npercent.1 However, this measure includes compensation methods like stock options that\nare more akin to profits than wages. So part of the strength in this measure may not\n1 Corrected January 26, 2007.\n\nactually indicate a tight labor market. Taken together, these two indicators provide at\nbest a mixed picture of tightness.\nMy own sense of how the labor market situation will affect inflation inclines me\nmore toward the benign view than the worrisome view—and I say this with the\nappropriate caveats, of course: There are indeed large uncertainties—and in particular,\nupside risks—to the outlook for inflation.\nTo begin with, over the past year, our main measure of consumer inflation—the\nprice index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, or the\ncore PCE price index—has increased by 2.2 percent, which is higher than I would like to\nsee. On a more positive note, inflation has come down in recent months, with this index\nup by a more acceptable 1.8 percent over the past three months.\nOne reason why inflationary pressure may be easing is due to the impact of\nstabilizing, and now falling, oil prices. As I mentioned, core inflation, by definition,\nexcludes energy prices, but energy prices still may affect core inflation to the extent that\nthey affect the prices of other goods and services. For example, transport companies\nmight raise their prices to pass along the higher costs of filling their trucks' gas tanks.\nThis is known as \"pass-through,\" and it is likely that it has played at least some role in\nrecent movements in core inflation. 2 Now that energy prices have fallen a fair bit from\n2 However, one shouldn't exaggerate the importance of pass-through. Research\nsuggests that the extent of pass-through for any given rise in energy prices has been lower\nin the past twenty-five years than it was back in the 1970s (see Mark Hooker, \"Are Oil\nShocks Inflationary? Asymmetric and Nonlinear Specifications versus Changes in\nRegime,\" Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking, May 2002).\n\nrecent highs and are expected by futures markets to remain at those lower levels, this\nupward pressure on core inflation is likely to dissipate and may even be turning into\nmodest downward pressure.\nHowever, it’s important to recognize that the effects of energy price changes on\ninflation are inherently temporary. Once they have fully worked through the system, we\nwill be left with the more fundamental and enduring influences of factors such as the\nextent of labor and product market tightness. This is why I spent so much time going into\nthe puzzle about why labor and product markets are currently sending mixed signals\nabout inflationary pressures. How this puzzle is resolved is a key issue for future\ninflation and therefore for monetary policy.\nA second reason to be optimistic about future inflation is that inflation\nexpectations appear to have been well anchored over the past ten years or so as the Fed\nhas established its credibility with the public about both its commitment to and its\ncompetence in keeping inflation at low and stable rates. For example, in the face of the\nlarge oil price increases we've seen in recent years, this credibility shows up in the\nstability of survey and market measures of inflation expectations looking ten years\nahead.3\n3 Bharat Trehan with Jason Tjosvold, \"Inflation Targets and Inflation Expectations: Some\nEvidence from the Recent Oil Shocks,\" FRBSF Economic Letter, 2006-22, September 1,\n2006. http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2006/el2006-22.html.\n\nStatistical analysis of the behavior of core inflation over time also lends some\nsupport to the view that inflation expectations are well anchored. In such statistical\nanalyses, the inflation data historically have exhibited “persistence.” This basically\nmeans that, when you're forecasting inflation, it works pretty well to assume that the rate\nin the future will be the same as it is today. The implication of persistence is frankly\nworrisome: Since inflation is too high today, persistence implies it could stay too high\nfor an extended period.\nHowever, research suggests that if a central bank's commitment to price stability\nhas gained credibility with the public, then the persistence observed in the inflation data\nwill tend to be dampened. And as it turns out, recent research at the Federal Reserve\nBank of San Francisco finds less evidence of persistence during the past ten years.4 That\nis, rather than sticking at a certain rate, core inflation has tended to revert to its long-run\naverage, which, over that period, is between 1-3/4 and 2 percent. Admittedly, the past ten\nyears constitute a relatively small sample from which to draw definitive conclusions.\nNonetheless, this evidence is important because, if it holds up, it implies that inflation\nmay move down from its elevated level faster than many forecasters expect.\nTo sum up my inflation forecast, then, I find recent inflation readings\nencouraging, but I also am keenly aware that this pattern has yet to show up in the data\non any sort of a sustained basis. The inflation situation remains uncertain and, in\n4 John C. Williams, \"The Phillips Curve in an Era of Well-Anchored Inflation\nExpectations,\" unpublished paper. A less technical version with the same title has been\npublished as FRBSF Economic Letter 2006-27\nhttp://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2006/el2006-27.html.\n\nparticular, there are upside risks to my outlook, especially having to do with the situation\nin labor markets.\nThese considerations play a key role in my views on monetary policy. I have\nsupported the decision to hold policy steady at the current rate. That may seem a little\nsurprising, given that inflation remains higher than I would like it to be and that there are\nsome upside risks to my inflation outlook. Let me be clear that I do want inflation to\nmove down, but I believe policy may now be well-positioned to foster exactly such an\noutcome while also giving due consideration to the risks to economic activity.\nI came to this conclusion by considering a variety of metrics that help assess the\nstance of policy. These measures include the forecast I have outlined today, as well as\nthe recommendations from commonly used Taylor rules for monetary policy, named after\nJohn Taylor, a professor at Stanford who first suggested them. They give an estimate of\nan appropriate setting of the funds rate given where inflation is relative to an assumed\ntarget and a measure of tightness in goods or labor markets.\nTaken as a whole, a variety of these rules indicate that the funds rate is currently\nwithin the moderately restrictive range that appears appropriate. Current conditions in\ngoods markets generally suggest that the current policy stance is sufficient to bring\ninflation down to more acceptable levels. In view of what I’ve said today, it will come as\nno surprise that consideration of the situation in labor markets provides less room for\noptimism on inflation. And while I am inclined to see labor market tightness as\ntransitory, I do take it as a serious risk.\n\nEven if policy is now well positioned, as I think is likely to be the case, it will still\ntake some additional time for inflation to unwind due to lags between policy actions and\ntheir impacts on economic activity and inflation. These lags can be anywhere from\nseveral months to a couple of years. This means that we have yet to see the full effects of\nthe series of 17 funds rate increases—some are probably still in the pipeline.\nYou will note that I am casting my statements about the stance of policy and the\noutlook in very conditional terms. I do this because of the great uncertainty that\nsurrounds economic forecasts and any simple measure of the tightness of monetary\npolicy. Frankly, all approaches to assessing the stance of policy are inherently imprecise.\nJust as imprecise is our understanding of how long the lags will be between our policy\nactions and their impacts on the economy and inflation. This uncertainty argues, then, for\npolicy to be responsive to the data as it emerges, especially since we are within range of\nthe desired policy setting. The decision to keep policy on hold allows us more time to\nobserve the data so that appropriate adjustments can be made over time.\n# # #",

    "text": "Speech to the Hong Kong Association of Northern California\nSan Francisco, California\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery October 16, 2006, 12:40 pm Pacific\nPresident Janet L. Yellen presented similar remarks to the California Independent Bankers 16th\nAnnual Convention in Laguna Beach, California on October 9, 2006.\nProspects for the U.S. Economy\nGood afternoon, everyone. It’s a pleasure to speak before the Hong Kong\nAssociation of Northern California today. In my remarks, I plan to give you my sense of\nwhere the U.S. economy and inflation are headed and to draw out the implications for\nmonetary policy. Though I do not plan to discuss the economies of Hong Kong or Asia\nin general in this context, I do want to assure you that they remain very much a focus of\nthe Bank’s attention. In our Economic Research Department, we have the long-\nestablished Center for Pacific Basin Studies, and in our Supervision and Regulation\nDivision, we have the Country Analysis Unit. Both groups produce publications,\nprograms, and conferences focused on Asia. In fact, we recently launched a website that\ncoordinates the information on their activities. For those who’d like to follow up, I’ve\nbrought along a description of the site as well as a couple of other publications.\nBecause of our location, it makes sense, of course, for the San Francisco Fed to\nhave a special interest in Asia and to bring our perspectives on that region of the world to\nbear on both U.S. monetary policy and regulatory policy. I should add that Asia is not\nonly an area that we study, it’s also an area I have the pleasure to visit. Each year, I join\nthe Federal Reserve Governor responsible for liaison with Asia on a “fact-finding” trip to\nthe region. These trips advance the Bank’s broad objectives of serving as a repository of\nexpertise on economic, banking, and financial issues relating to the Pacific Basin and of\nbuilding ties with policymakers and economic officials there. This year—in fact, next\n\nmonth—I will spend a week in China with Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh, who\njoined the Board last February. We will visit Beijing, Chengdu, and Shanghai, and, as\nalways I’m very excited about the trip. I also feel especially fortunate to be able to meet\nwith you beforehand to get your views on developments in the region. So I look forward\nto a lively and informative question and answer session following my remarks on the\nU.S. economic outlook. Before I begin, let me note that my comments represent my own\nviews and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nOne of the main things I want to focus on is what this outlook implies for\nmonetary policy, and, in particular, I’ll discuss the decision at the last meeting of the\nFederal Open Market Committee. As you know, that was the second consecutive time\nthat the Committee decided to hold the federal funds rate at 5¼ percent, after having\nraised it by one-quarter percentage point at each of the prior seventeen meetings. So my\nplan is to go into some of my reasoning for supporting the approach underlying that\ndecision.\nTo do that, I need to step back a little in time, because where the economy is now\nand where I think it is headed have a lot to do with how we got here in the first place.\nLet me take you back to mid-2004, when the Fed first began to raise the federal funds\nrate. This move followed a long period—about a year and a half—of holding the rate at a\nvery low 1 to 1¼ percent to provide the stimulus needed to reduce the risk of outright\ndeflation. Eventually, that stimulus, together with the general resilience of our economic\nsystem, did help the economy pick up steam. By June of 2004, the threat of deflation had\npassed, and it was time to start removing monetary stimulus. And, as I said, that’s what\nthe Committee did, one quarter-percentage-point step at a time. In fact, if you chart the\n\npath of the funds rate since then, it looks a lot like a staircase, or, as some have dubbed it,\nan escalator. Over the course of much of this time, the economy averaged solid growth—\nor even better than solid growth; in fact, the economy was growing at a pace that was\nnoticeably higher than estimates of the rate it can sustain in the long run.\nWith this strong performance, we also have seen the slack in labor and product\nmarkets dwindle. For example, the civilian unemployment rate dropped by 1 percentage\npoint to 4.6 percent in September. This rate is a bit lower than conventional estimates of\nso-called “full employment” and, therefore, suggests that by now labor markets may even\nhave moved a bit to the tight side.\nAt the same time, inflation rose, and it has been higher for some time now than I\nlike to see it—not only headline inflation, but also the core measure, which excludes the\nvolatile food and energy components. The particular inflation measure the Committee\nfocuses on in its Monetary Policy Report to Congress is the core personal consumption\nexpenditures price index. Over the past year, it rose at nearly a 2½ percent rate.\nAlthough I’m somewhat encouraged that various measures of core inflation have edged\ndown recently, it’s clear that more progress is needed.\nAt the August meeting, it seemed that the signs of a slowdown in economic\nactivity were starting to show up, at least in part because of the Fed’s previous efforts to\nremove monetary accommodation. Inflationary pressures also seemed reasonably likely\nto gradually abate. So, at that time, the Committee decided to pause—to “step off the\nescalator” and wait a while to see how the previous funds rate increases and other\ninfluences on the economy were playing out. Since then, there have been further signs of\n\nslowing, and at the September meeting, the Committee again decided in favor of a\npause—to “stay on the landing,” so to speak, leaving the funds rate at 5¼ percent.\nProspects for Economic Activity\nNow that I’ve covered how we got here, the questions are, where are we exactly,\nand what is the likely outlook for economic activity and inflation?\nFirst, the economy. As I mentioned, the data we’ve been seeing in recent months\npoint to a noticeable slowdown for this half of the year, with growth running at only a\nmodest pace and clearly below the rate that is sustainable in the long run. Naturally,\nthere are forces both supporting growth and restraining it, so let me enumerate some of\nthem here.\nThe factors working to support growth include ongoing strength in business\ndemand, fueling relatively rapid growth in spending on business investment in equipment\nand software, including the important high-tech industries. Moreover, spending for the\nconstruction of nonresidential structures has advanced smartly so far this year, and\npromises to remain strong for a while longer. For example, outlays on drilling and\nmining structures have continued to increase in response to oil prices that are still high\nand expected to remain so. Furthermore, fundamentals in commercial real estate markets\ncontinued to improve this year, increasing demand for commercial space from office\nparks to warehouses. Going forward, even at a more moderate pace of economic\nexpansion, private forecasters expect the positive trends in commercial real estate in both\nCalifornia and the nation to continue but to moderate next year as capacity comes online.\nI should note, however, that the Bay Area is a bit of an exception. Vacancy rates in San\nFrancisco and San Jose still remain above their median for the past ten-year period,\n\nalthough they are vastly better than during the days of the dot-com bust. On a positive\nnote, gross rents have risen in San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, and Sacramento.\nNow for the factors that are likely to restrain the nation’s economic growth. One\nobvious factor, of course, is energy prices. It is quite likely that the surge in the price of\noil over the past couple of years has taken a bite out of consumer spending, even if other\nfactors, like growth of jobs, wages, and wealth, have kept consumption moving up\noverall.\nNeedless to say, it has been something of a relief to see that oil prices have\nreceded quite a bit in recent months, probably because threats to supply from the Middle\nEast conflict and from the Gulf Coast hurricane season have eased. At this point, futures\nmarkets expect them to stabilize around the current lower levels, and if they do, the\nrestraint we’ve felt this year should evaporate over 2007; in fact, more stable oil prices\nwould actually contribute to a pickup in growth next year. Of course, given the well-\nknown volatility of energy markets, that’s a very big “if,” so they remain a wild card in\nthe outlook as usual.\nThe high price of oil is also hitting the auto industry, in particular, U.S. auto\nproduction, and that is another factor working to slow our economy. People aren’t just\ngroaning every time they pump gas and watch the numbers roll up and up, they’re also\nlooking for more fuel-efficient vehicles. That’s good news for some of the foreign\nautomakers, but not such good news for some U.S. producers, for whom SUVs and trucks\nhave been a key source of strength. As the demand for these vehicles has dropped pretty\nsharply, producers find themselves holding unsustainably high inventories. So it’s little\nwonder that we should have read recently about Ford or GM offering buyouts to their\n\nemployees as they move to ramp down production. These production cuts will likely\nslow overall real GDP growth in the U.S. until the adjustment to a lower level is reached,\nmost likely next year.\nAnother factor restraining growth is the rise in interest rates over the past couple\nof years as the Fed has removed monetary policy accommodation. Since this process\nbegan in mid-2004, short- and intermediate-term interest rates are up substantially.\nLong-term rates present a more mixed picture, with some—such as conventional\nmortgage rates—essentially the same and others actually lower than before. Nonetheless,\nthe overall effect of these rate changes should be to reduce demand, particularly in\ninterest-sensitive sectors.\nOf course, housing is a particularly interest-sensitive sector, and, as we know, it\nalready has shown clear signs of cooling. Frankly, the pace of it has been a little\nsurprising. Nationally, housing permits are down noticeably—by more than 20 percent—\nfrom a year ago. In addition, inventories of unsold houses are up significantly, sales of\nnew and existing homes are off their peaks, and surveys of homebuyers and builders are\nshowing much more pessimistic attitudes.\nThe national data on residential investment reflect all of these developments and\nenter directly into the calculation of real GDP growth. After adjusting for inflation, (real)\nresidential investment dropped at an 11 percent annual rate in the second quarter\nfollowing two small declines in the prior two quarters.\nThe California data, not surprisingly, show even more softening in the housing\nmarket. For the first half of this year, quarterly average home sales in California are\ndown nearly four times as much as they are nationwide, and new housing activity also\n\nhas slowed more dramatically in the state and in the Bay Area. The local exception is the\nSan Jose-Santa Clara area, where the decline in new single-family housing permits this\nyear has been more moderate, presumably because of the relative strength of the Silicon\nValley’s tech firms.\nAccording to some of our contacts elsewhere in this Federal Reserve District, data\nlike these are actually “behind the curve,” and they’re willing to bet that things will get\nworse before they get better. For example, a major home builder has told me that the\nshare of unsold homes has topped 80 percent in some of the new subdivisions around\nPhoenix and Las Vegas, which he labeled the new “ghost towns” of the West. Though\nthe situation isn’t that bad everywhere, a significant buildup of home inventory implies\nthat permits and starts may continue to fall and the market may not recover for several\nyears. While builders remain hesitant to cut prices so far, and instead offer sales\nincentives, price cuts at some point in the future seem almost inevitable.\nIndeed, we have already seen that the pace of house-price appreciation has clearly\nmoderated, and there are signs that it may continue. For example, one indicator we have\nbeen following is the Case-Shiller house price index, which is based on house price data\nin ten large urban markets—three of which are in California, by the way. Beginning in\nMay of this year, futures contracts on this price index began trading, and they show house\nprices falling at about a 6 percent annual rate by the end of this year. Though this is still\na very new and pretty thin market, the results are interesting and suggestive.\nSignificant movements in house prices can be an issue for economic activity. Just\nas the run-up in house prices provided some support for consumer spending, slower\nincreases, and especially outright decreases, could weaken that support. For example,\n\nback when house prices were rising so fast, people saw that more and more equity was\nbeing built up in their houses, and they might well have felt that they could afford to\nspend pretty freely. In economic terms, this is called the “wealth effect.” In addition,\nwith instruments like home equity loans, refinancing, and so on, households have found it\nmuch easier to pull money out of their rising house values to support their spending.\nNow, with the pace of house-price appreciation slowing, of course, their equity is not\nrising so fast anymore, which may weaken the growth in consumer spending. In\nCalifornia, the impact of a vanishing wealth effect might be quite significant because\nover the past year the state has seen a more rapid deceleration in housing prices than the\nnation. In fact, two northern California metropolitan areas, San Mateo and Sacramento\neven reported declines in house prices over the past year.\nProspects for Inflation\nNow let me turn to the outlook for inflation. As I’ve indicated, core consumer\ninflation has been uncomfortably high recently. Therefore, in keeping with the\nCommittee’s responsibilities for promoting price stability for the nation, I believe it is\ncritical that inflation trend in a downward direction over the medium term. Indeed, my\nexpectation is that this is the most likely outcome for several reasons.\nFirst, as I’ve explained, the economy appears to have entered a period of below-\ntrend growth. If this continues for a time, as I think is likely, the tightness we have seen\nin labor and product markets would ease somewhat, tending gradually to reverse any\nunderlying inflationary pressures.\nA second reason to expect inflationary pressures to lessen has to do with the\nimpact of stabilizing, or even falling, oil prices on core inflation. As I mentioned, core\n\ninflation, by definition, excludes energy prices, but energy prices may affect core\ninflation to the extent that they affect the prices of other goods and services. For\nexample, transport companies might raise their prices to pass along the higher costs of\nfilling their trucks’ gas tanks. This is known as “passthrough,” and it is likely that it has\nplayed at least some role in recent core inflation movements. Now that energy prices\nhave fallen a fair bit from recent highs and are expected by futures markets to remain at\nthose lower levels, this upward pressure on core inflation is likely to dissipate and could\neven turn into modest downward pressure at some point.\nBut let me note that we shouldn’t exaggerate the importance of this point. Recent\nanalysis suggests that the extent of passthrough for any given rise in energy prices has\nbeen lower in the past twenty-five years than it was back in the 1970s.1 For a specific\nexample, consider airfares, which have increased markedly over the past year.\nConsidering that jet fuel accounts for one-eighth to one-fourth of airlines’ operating\ncosts, it would make sense to think they have passed through higher fuel prices into\nairfare increases. However, some simple calculations show that the cost increases from\nrising jet fuel are likely insufficient to explain more than a portion of the airfare\nincreases, and that higher load factors are likely to be part of the explanation.\nThe final reason to be optimistic about inflation moving lower is that inflation\nexpectations appear to have been well anchored over the past ten years or so as the Fed\nhas established its credibility with the public about both its commitment to and its\ncompetence in keeping inflation at low and stable rates. For example, in the face of the\nlarge oil price increases we’ve seen in recent years, this credibility shows up in the\n1 Mark Hooker, “Are Oil Shocks Inflationary? Asymmetric and Nonlinear Specifications versus Changes\nin Regime,” Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking, May 2002.\n\nstability of survey and market measures of inflation expectations looking ten years\nahead.2\nStatistical analysis of the behavior of core inflation over time also lends some\nsupport to the view that inflation expectations are well anchored. In such statistical\nanalyses, the inflation data historically have exhibited persistence. This basically means\nthat, when you’re forecasting inflation, it works pretty well to assume that the rate in the\nfuture will be the same as it is today. The implication of persistence is frankly\nworrisome: Since inflation is too high today, persistence implies it could stay too high\nfor an extended period.\nHowever, research suggests that if a central bank’s commitment to price stability\nhas gained credibility with the public, then the persistence observed in the inflation data\nwill tend to be dampened. And as it turns out, recent research at the Federal Reserve\nBank of San Francisco finds less evidence of persistence during the past ten years.3 That\nis, rather than sticking at a certain rate, core inflation has tended to revert to its long-run\naverage, which, over that period, is between 1-1/2 to 2 percent. Admittedly, the past ten\nyears constitute a relatively small sample from which to draw definitive conclusions.\nNonetheless, this evidence is important because, if it holds up, it implies that inflation\nmay move down from its elevated level faster than many forecasters expect.\nI would like to stress that a finding of low persistence in inflation is no reason for\nthe Fed to rest on its laurels of credibility. Rather, credibility is something that neither\n2 Bharat Trehan with Jason Tjosvold, “Inflation Targets and Inflation Expectations: Some Evidence from\nthe Recent Oil Shocks,” FRBSF Economic Letter, number 2006-22, September 1, 2006.\nhttp://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2006/el2006-22.html\n3 John C.

A less technical version with the\nsame title is forthcoming as FRBSF Economic Letter 2006-27 (October 13, 2006)\nhttp://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/\n\nI—nor my colleagues—take for granted for a moment. We know full well that\nmaintaining credibility requires that we act when necessary to keep inflation under\ncontrol.\nSo, in summary, I think there are a number of reasons to expect core inflation to\ntrend gradually lower in the future. However, I am keenly aware that this pattern has yet\nto show up in the data on any sort of a sustained basis. The inflation outlook remains\nhighly uncertain, and until we actually see inflation begin to slow down, I will be focused\non the upside risks in the outlook.\nPolicy issues\nThis leads me back to where I began—monetary policy and the Committee’s\ndecisions at the last two meetings to pause for a time after 17 quarter-point rate hikes in a\nrow. Why does a pause make sense to me now, while at the same time I say I’m worried\nthat inflation is too high? My answer is that I do want to see inflation move down, but I\nbelieve policy may now be well-positioned to foster exactly such an outcome while also\ngiving due consideration to the risks to economic activity.\nThe stance of policy can be assessed by a variety of metrics. These measures\ninclude the forecast I have outlined today, as well as the recommendations from\ncommonly used monetary policy rules. Taken as a whole, such rules— often referred to\nas Taylor rules—indicate that the funds rate is currently within the moderately restrictive\nrange that appears appropriate,\nIf policy is now well positioned, it will still take time for inflation to unwind due\nto lags between policy actions and their impacts on economic activity and inflation.\nThese lags can be anywhere from several months to a couple of years. This means that\n\nwe have yet to see the full effects of the series of 17 funds rate increases—some are\nprobably still in the pipeline.\nYou will note that I am casting my statements about the stance of policy and the\noutlook in very conditional terms. I do this because of the great uncertainty that\nsurrounds these issues. Frankly, all approaches to assessing the stance of policy are\ninherently imprecise. Just as imprecise is our understanding of how long the lags will be\nbetween our policy actions and their impacts on the economy and inflation. This\nuncertainty argues, then, for policy to be responsive to the data as it emerges, especially\nas we get within range of the desired policy setting. The decision to pause allows us\nmore time to observe the data so that appropriate adjustments can be made over time.\nFor example, with the passage of time, we will gain more information on whether we\nhave done enough to assure that inflation moves gradually lower.\nIn summary, monetary policymakers again are doing a balancing act, seeking the\nbest way to temper inflationary pressures while not exposing the business cycle\nexpansion to undue risk. Holding the stance of policy steady for a time makes sense to\nme. First, we appear to be within range of the moderately restrictive policy setting that\nseems appropriate. Second, pausing gives us time to observe the effects of previous\npolicy actions and other factors to allow for adjustments to the policy setting that will\nkeep us moving toward the desired outcome for inflation, output, and employment.\n# # #",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n12:30 p.m. EDT\nJune 6, 2016\nCurrent Conditions and the Outlook for the U.S. Economy\nRemarks by\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe World Affairs Council of Philadelphia\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nJune 6, 2016\n\nI am delighted to be with you today. I will discuss recent economic\ndevelopments, the outlook, and their implications for monetary policy. My message will\nbe largely favorable, although recent developments have been mixed. Most importantly,\nthe economy has registered considerable progress over the past several years toward the\nFederal Reserve’s goals of maximum employment and price stability, and, as I will\nexplain, there are good reasons to expect that we will advance further toward those goals.\nThe news from the labor market over the past year has been generally good, with\nsignificant job gains, the unemployment rate declining below 5 percent, rising household\nincomes, and tentative signs of faster wage growth. At the same time, recent signs of a\nslowdown in job creation bear close watching. Inflation has been lower than our\nobjective of 2 percent, but I expect it to move up over time for reasons that I will\ndescribe. If incoming data are consistent with labor market conditions strengthening and\ninflation making progress toward our 2 percent objective, as I expect, further gradual\nincreases in the federal funds rate are likely to be appropriate and most conducive to\nmeeting and maintaining those objectives. However, I will emphasize that monetary\npolicy is not on a preset course and significant shifts in the outlook for the economy\nwould necessitate corresponding shifts in the appropriate path of policy.\nIn particular, an important theme of my remarks today will be the inevitable\nuncertainty surrounding the outlook for the economy. Unfortunately, all economic\nprojections are certain to turn out to be inaccurate in some respects, and possibly\nsignificantly so. Will the economic situation in Europe or China take a turn for the worse\nor exceed expectations? Will U.S. productivity growth pick up and allow stronger\ngrowth of gross domestic product (GDP) and incomes or instead continue to stagnate?\n\n- 2 -\nWhat will happen with the price of oil? The uncertainties are sizable, and progress\ntoward our goals and, by implication, the appropriate stance of monetary policy will\ndepend on how these uncertainties evolve. Indeed, the policy path that my colleagues\nand I judge most likely to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability\nhas evolved and will continue to evolve in response to developments that alter our\neconomic outlook and the associated risks to that outlook.\nThe Current Economic Situation\nThe economic expansion following the Great Recession has now been under way\nfor seven years. The recovery has not always been smooth, but overall, the gains have\nbeen impressive. In particular, the job market has strengthened substantially, and I\nbelieve we are now close to eliminating the slack that has weighed on the labor market\nsince the recession.\nI will turn to this past Friday’s labor market report in a moment, but let me begin\nwith some background: The economy added 2.7 million jobs last year, an average of\nabout 230,000 a month. In the first three months of this year, payrolls were growing only\nmodestly slower, at a little less than a 200,000 monthly pace. The unemployment rate\nhad fallen to 5 percent, down from a peak of 10 percent in 2009. In addition, the Bureau\nof Labor Statistics’ measure of the job openings rate was at a record high in March, and\nthe quits rate--the share of employees voluntarily leaving their jobs--has moved up and in\nMarch stood close to its pre-recession levels.1 The increase in the quits rate is a sign that\nworkers are feeling more confident about the job market and are likely receiving more\njob offers.\n1 Note, however, that the help-wanted index published by the Conference Board suggests that the rate of\njob openings has been about flat over the past year.\n\n- 3 -\nSo the overall labor market situation has been quite positive. In that context, this\npast Friday’s labor market report was disappointing. Payroll gains were reported to have\nbeen much smaller in April and May than earlier in the year, averaging only about 80,000\nper month.2 And while the unemployment rate was reported to have fallen further in\nMay, that decline occurred not because more people had jobs but because fewer people\nreported that they were actively seeking work. A broader measure of labor market slack\nthat includes workers marginally attached to the workforce and those working part-time\nwho would prefer full-time work was unchanged. An encouraging aspect of the report,\nhowever, was that average hourly earnings for all employees in the nonfarm private\nsector increased 2-1/2 percent over the past 12 months--a bit faster than in recent years\nand a welcome indication that wage growth may finally be picking up.3\nAlthough this recent labor market report was, on balance, concerning, let me\nemphasize that one should never attach too much significance to any single monthly\nreport. Other timely indicators from the labor market have been more positive. For\nexample, the number of people filing new claims for unemployment insurance--which\ncan be a good early indicator of changes in labor market conditions--remains quite low,\nand the public’s perceptions of the health of the labor market, as reported in various\nconsumer surveys, remain positive. That said, the monthly labor market report is an\n2 Payroll employment is now reported to have increased 123,000 in April and 38,000 in May. According to\nthe Bureau of Labor Statistics, payrolls in May were held down about 35,000 by workers on strike at\nVerizon; thus, the strike can account for a relatively small portion of the slowdown in payroll growth in\nMay. The Verizon workers are now back on the job and should be included in the June payroll counts.\n3 Hourly compensation in the business sector (a measure that includes benefit costs as well as wages) is\nnow reported to have increased about 3 percent over the year ended in the first quarter of 2016, somewhat\nabove the average increase in this series over the preceding several years. In addition, according to the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s “wage growth tracker,” wage gains for continuously employed full-time\nworkers have been gradually trending higher in recent years and were 3-1/2 percent over the 12 months\nthrough April. However, the employment cost index, another broad measure of labor compensation costs,\nhas remained quite soft, rising only 1-3/4 percent over the year ended in March.\n\n- 4 -\nimportant economic indicator, and so we will need to watch labor market developments\ncarefully.\nEconomic conditions here in the Philadelphia metropolitan area have improved\nbroadly in line with national trends. During the downturn, the Philadelphia area and the\ncity itself saw unemployment rise by less than it did for the nation as a whole, but\nunemployment took longer to recover thereafter.4 In the City of Philadelphia, in\nparticular, unemployment was still running above 10 percent as recently as 2013. But\nunemployment here has fallen appreciably since then, helped by a revival in residential\nand commercial construction that is evident around the city.\nWhile the general picture of the labor market is largely positive, some people are\nstill struggling. Unemployment rates rose more during the recession for African\nAmericans and Hispanics than for the nation overall, and even though those rates have\nalso come down by more during the economic expansion, unemployment remains higher\nfor these groups. Unfortunately, those gaps have not narrowed noticeably relative to\nwhere they were before the recession. Unemployment rates for young African American\nand Hispanic men without a college degree remain especially high, and one important\nbenefit from further improvement in the labor market would be increased job\nopportunities for these men and other groups that currently still experience high\nunemployment. To be sure, many of the factors that contribute to the labor market\noutcomes of minority groups are not amenable to monetary policy, and measures beyond\nthe scope of monetary policy should be considered to alleviate the economic challenges\n4 The discussion refers to data for the Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE-MD Metropolitan\nStatistical Area. Since 1990, the area’s unemployment rate has averaged about 1/4 percentage point lower\nthan the national rate. By contrast, in the City of Philadelphia itself, the unemployment rate has generally\nrun about 2 percentage points higher than for the broader metropolitan area.\n\n- 5 -\nthat these and other Americans face. Education and training, of course, are vital. Later\ntoday, I will visit one program that helps workers in West Philadelphia learn new skills\nand then connects them with potential employers, an initiative in which government,\nbusinesses, and local institutions are working together successfully.\nWhile the economy has made great strides toward the FOMC’s objective of\nmaximum employment, somewhat less progress has been made toward our inflation\nobjective. Inflation has run persistently below the Fed’s goal of 2 percent over the past\nseveral years even as the labor market strengthened significantly.5 Over the 12 months\nthrough April, the price index for personal consumption expenditures rose only about 1\npercent. But I remain optimistic, because two factors that have been holding down\ninflation will likely prove only temporary. First, the sharp drop in crude oil prices since\nthe middle of 2014 has lowered prices of gasoline and other energy products,\nsignificantly restraining overall inflation. At about the same time, the foreign exchange\nvalue of the dollar strengthened, holding down prices of imported goods. But oil prices\nhave stopped declining and indeed have risen from their low point earlier this year. And,\nsince the beginning of the year, the dollar has been roughly unchanged against a broad\nbasket of currencies. As the downward pressure on prices from these two forces\ndissipates and as the labor market strengthens further, I expect inflation to move back to\n2 percent.\n5 The notion that inflation can be too low sounds strange to many people, but very low inflation typically\nmeans very low nominal interest rates, leaving little room for monetary policy to push rates down to offset\nadverse shocks to the economy, thereby increasing the chances that recessions and the associated job losses\nwould be more severe and persistent. In addition, persistent and unexpectedly low inflation may\nsignificantly raise the real cost of making mortgage and other loan payments if accompanied by (as is\ntypically the case) smaller-than-anticipated nominal income gains.\n\n- 6 -\nThe Economic Outlook\nLet me now turn to the outlook for the economy. GDP growth was reported to\nhave been relatively weak early this year, but this measure of growth in economic activity\ncan vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Indeed, while spending data for the second\nquarter are limited at present, recent data on retail sales and motor vehicle sales point to a\nsignificant step-up in consumer spending and GDP growth this quarter.6\nStepping back from near-term indicators, I would like to focus more broadly on\nthe factors likely to affect economic performance over the coming years. Next week,\nconcurrent with our policy meeting, the FOMC participants will release a new set of\neconomic projections. Those could, of course, differ from the previous set of such\nprojections in March. But speaking for myself, although the economy recently has been\naffected by a mix of countervailing forces, I see good reasons to expect that the positive\nforces supporting employment growth and higher inflation will continue to outweigh the\nnegative ones. As a result, I expect the economic expansion to continue, with the labor\nmarket improving further and GDP growing moderately. And as I just noted, I expect to\nsee inflation moving up to 2 percent over the next couple of years.\nLet me start with the positive. The increase in employment over the past several\nyears has contributed to higher household incomes and strengthening consumer\nconfidence. If the May labor report was an aberration or reflects a temporary slowdown\nresulting from the weakness in economic activity at the start of the year, then job growth\nshould pick up and support further gains in income. In addition, rising equity and house\nprices have helped restore households’ wealth. The fall in oil prices has supported\n6 On a seasonally adjusted basis, sales of light motor vehicles fell to an annual rate of 16.5 million units in\nMarch but then rebounded to a pace of 17.3 million units in April and 17.4 million units in May.\n\n- 7 -\nhousehold purchasing power as well. Simple calculations suggest that the average\nhousehold has gained some $1,300 in purchasing power since mid-2014 from the fall in\ngasoline prices.7 With continuing gains in disposable income and wealth, I expect\nconsumer spending to grow at a solid rate. I also expect the housing sector to make\nfurther progress. Both home sales and construction have been gradually improving, and\nresidential investment made a noticeable contribution to GDP growth over the past year.\nHousing has been supported by low mortgage rates, and while mortgage credit is still\ndifficult to obtain for households with low credit scores or hard-to-document income,\nthose with good credit histories are generally able to borrow at very favorable terms.8\nAnd fiscal policy at the combined national, state, and local levels, which subtracted from\nGDP growth for much of recovery, is now a small positive.\nEconomists often say, “on the other hand.” So, in keeping with that tradition, I’ll\nnow turn to the less-positive. Economic developments abroad have significantly\nrestrained growth in the United States over the past year, although I am cautiously\noptimistic that these headwinds are now fading. Concerns about slowing growth in China\nand falling commodity prices, which afflicted global financial markets early this year and\nthus likely weighed on demand, appear to have eased somewhat. Indicators suggest that\nforeign economies are growing, if still at only a moderate pace, and foreign financial\nmarkets have recovered and stabilized. That said, net exports have been a drag on U.S.\nGDP growth over the past year and are likely to continue to weigh on growth over the\n7 In 2013, according to the Energy Information Agency, households purchased about 730 gallons per\nhousehold on average. Applying the drop in gasoline prices since the first half of 2014, savings per\nhousehold averaged about $110 in the second half of 2014, $780 in 2015, and another $420 through May of\nthis year, implying a cumulative overall gain of more than $1,300 per household on average.\n8 Housing could receive another boost if there were a continued revival in the rate of new household\nformation, which has been depressed since the recession as young adults have delayed moving out of their\nparents’ homes.\n\n- 8 -\nmedium term. This drag, in part, reflects the prolonged effects of the significant increase\nin the foreign exchange value of the dollar since the middle of 2014, a development that\nhas been particularly challenging for U.S. manufacturers and other firms competing with\nforeign producers.\nAlthough lower oil prices have likely been a positive influence on the U.S.\neconomy overall, they also have had a negative side, given the sizable U.S. energy\nindustry. New drilling and energy-sector employment have plunged, and the effects have\nspilled over to businesses serving the energy production sector. But the largest declines\nin drilling activity are likely now behind us, and with oil prices having recovered\nsomewhat, I expect that oil prices will become less of a factor.\nBusiness investment has been weak in the past six months or so, even beyond the\nenergy sector, and investment in capital equipment is reported to have declined in the last\nquarter of 2015 and first quarter of this year. I suspect there is a transitory element to this\nweak investment performance, and I expect investment to rebound. But the latest labor\nmarket data raise the less favorable possibility that firms may instead have decided to\nexpand their operations more slowly, and I intend to continue to pay close attention to\ndevelopments in this area.\nAs I said, the positive economic forces have outweighed the negative, and despite\nthe challenges that the economy continues to face, I continue to expect further progress\ntoward our employment and inflation objectives.\nSome Important Uncertainties\nTo be sure, there is considerable uncertainty about the economic outlook that I\nhave been discussing, and, as I have already noted, we should expect to be surprised in\n\n- 9 -\nthe future just as we have been surprised in the past. Four areas of uncertainty seem\nparticularly salient at present.\nThe first involves the thrust and resilience of domestic demand. The U.S.\neconomy has performed better than many others around the globe, and that performance\nhas relied chiefly on the resilience of domestic sources of demand, consumer spending in\nparticular. So an important question is whether the U.S. economy could continue to\nmake progress amid fairly considerable global bumpiness. I continue to think that the\nanswer to that question is yes, but the weak investment performance in recent months is\nconcerning, and Friday’s employment report provides another reminder that the question\nis still relevant.\nThe second uncertainty pertains to the economic situation abroad. Even though\nthe financial stresses that had emanated from abroad at the start of this year have eased,\nglobal risks require continued attention. Much of the turmoil early this year appeared to\nbe associated with concern over the outlook for Chinese growth, which in turn has broad\nimplications for commodity prices and global economic growth. Recently, the renminbi\nhas moved in a more predictable fashion and Chinese capital outflows have abated.\nHowever, it is widely acknowledged that China faces considerable challenges as it\ncontinues to rebalance its economy toward domestic demand and consumption.\nMore generally, in the current environment of sluggish growth, low inflation, and\nalready very accommodative monetary policy in many advanced economies, investor\nperceptions of and appetite for risk can change abruptly. One development that could\nshift investor sentiment is the upcoming referendum in the United Kingdom. A U.K.\nvote to exit the European Union could have significant economic repercussions.\n\n- 10 -\nA third key uncertainty for the U.S. economy is the outlook for productivity\ngrowth--that is, increases in the amount of output produced per hour worked. While the\njob market has strengthened significantly, GDP increases have been less impressive.\nThat combination of solid labor market gains and moderate GDP growth reflects the fact\nthat labor productivity growth has been unusually weak in recent years, averaging less\nthan 1/2 percent per year since 2010.9\nOver time, productivity growth is the key determinant of improvements in living\nstandards, supporting higher pay for workers without increased costs for employers.\nRecent weak productivity growth likely helps account for the disappointing pace of wage\ngains during this economic expansion. Therefore, understanding whether, and by how\nmuch, productivity growth will pick up is a crucial part of the economic outlook. But this\nis a very difficult question, and economists are divided. Some are relatively optimistic,\npointing to the ongoing pace of innovations that promise revolutionary technologies,\nfrom genetically tailored medical therapies to self-driving cars. Others believe that the\nlow-hanging fruit of innovation largely has been picked and that there is simply less\nscope for further gains.10\nMy position has been, and remains, cautiously optimistic. There is some evidence\nthat the deep recession had a long-lasting effect in depressing investment, research and\n9 The figures measure output per hour worked in the business sector. From 2007:Q4 through 2016:Q1,\nproductivity growth averaged about 1 percent per year. By comparison, business-sector productivity\ngrowth averaged 1-1/2 percent per year over the two decades from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s, and\nthen it averaged 2¬3/4 percent per year over the next dozen years until the latest recession began.\n10 On the relatively optimistic side, see Mokyr (2014) or Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2014). For a less\noptimistic perspective, see Gordon (2016) or Cowen (2011). Similarly, Fernald (2014) dates the most\nrecent slowdown in measured productivity growth to before the great recession, in 2005. For evidence that\nthe recent slowdown cannot be fully explained by measurement difficulties, see Byrne, Fernald, and\nReinsdorf (2016).\n\n- 11 -\ndevelopment spending, and the start-up of new firms, and that these factors have, in turn,\nlowered productivity growth. With time, I expect this effect to ease in a stronger\neconomy.11 I also see no obvious slowdown in the pace or the potential benefits of\ninnovation in America, which likewise may bear fruit more readily in a stronger\neconomy. In the meantime, it would be helpful to adopt public policies designed to boost\nproductivity. Strengthening education and promoting innovation and investment, public\nand private, will support longer-term growth in productivity and greater gains in living\nstandards.\nA fourth important uncertainty for the economic outlook involves how quickly\ninflation will move back to 2 percent. As long as oil prices do not resume their earlier\ndeclines and the dollar does not rise substantially further, my expectation is that inflation\nwill move up to 2 percent over the next one to two years. But oil prices and the dollar\ncan move unpredictably. In addition, a further strengthening of labor market conditions\nwould typically be estimated to exert modest upward pressure on inflation over the next\ncouple of years; but such estimates are inherently imprecise, and the effect on inflation\ncould turn out to be significantly different, either upward or downward, than I expect.\nUncertainty concerning the outlook for inflation also reflects, in part, uncertainty\nabout the behavior of those inflation expectations that are relevant to price setting. For\ntwo decades, inflation has been relatively stable, reacting less persistently than before to\ntemporary factors like a recession or a swing in oil prices. The most convincing\nexplanation for this stability, in my view, is that longer-term inflation expectations have\nremained quite stable.12 So it bears noting that some survey measures of longer-term\n11 See Reifschneider, Wascher, and Wilcox (2015).\n12 For a more detailed discussion, see Yellen (2015a).\n\n- 12 -\ninflation expectations have moved a little lower over the past couple of years, while\nproxies for these expectations inferred from financial market instruments like inflation-\nprotected securities have moved down more noticeably. It is unclear whether these\nindicators point to a true decline in those inflation expectations that are relevant for price\nsetting; for example, the financial market measures may reflect changing attitudes toward\ninflation risk more than actual inflation expectations. But the indicators have moved\nenough to get my close attention. If inflation expectations really are moving lower, that\ncould call into question whether inflation will move back to 2 percent as quickly as I\nexpect.\nPolicy Implications\nLet me now turn to the implications of the economic outlook, as well as the\nuncertainties associated with that outlook, for monetary policy. My overall assessment is\nthat the current stance of monetary policy is generally appropriate, in that it is providing\nsupport to the economy by encouraging further labor market improvement that will help\nreturn inflation to 2 percent. At the same time, I continue to think that the federal funds\nrate will probably need to rise gradually over time to ensure price stability and maximum\nsustainable employment in the longer run.\nSeveral considerations lead me to this conclusion. First, the current stance of\nmonetary policy is stimulative, although perhaps not as stimulative as might appear at\nfirst glance. One useful measure of the stance of policy is the deviation of the federal\nfunds rate from a “neutral” value, defined as the level of the federal funds rate that would\nbe neither expansionary nor contractionary if the economy was operating near potential.\nThis neutral rate changes over time, and, at any given date, it depends on a constellation\n\n- 13 -\nof underlying forces affecting the economy. At present, many estimates show the neutral\nrate to be quite low by historical standards--indeed, close to zero when measured in real,\nor inflation-adjusted, terms.13 The current actual value of the federal funds rate, also\nmeasured in real terms, is even lower, somewhere around minus 1 percent. With the\nactual real federal funds rate modestly below the relatively low neutral real rate, the\nstance of monetary policy at present should be viewed as modestly accommodative.14\nAlthough the economy is now fairly close to the FOMC’s goal of maximum\nemployment, I view our modestly accommodative stance of policy as appropriate for\nseveral reasons. First, with inflation continuing to run below our objective, a mild\nundershooting of the unemployment rate considered to be normal in the longer run could\nhelp move inflation back up to 2 percent more quickly. Second, a stronger job market\ncould also support labor market improvement along other dimensions, including greater\nlabor force participation. A third reason relates to the risks associated with the constraint\non conventional monetary policy when the federal funds rate is near zero. If inflation\nwere to move persistently above 2 percent or the economy were to become notably\noverheated, the Committee could readily increase the target range for the federal funds\nrate. However, if inflation were to remain persistently low or the expansion were to\n13 The neutral rate is not directly observable and must instead be inferred from economic data, and\nestimates will vary depending on the methodology employed. However, we know that the neutral rate must\nhave been well below its historical norm in recent years, because with the actual real interest having been\nas low as it has been lately, the economy would have otherwise expanded much more than has been the\ncase. In recent years, the neutral rate has likely been held down below normal levels because of the factors\nI discussed earlier, including persistently weak growth abroad, the high exchange value of the dollar, low\nrates of household formation, and weak productivity growth. As I have noted before (see Yellen, 2015b),\nthere is empirical evidence to support the conclusion that the neutral rate is currently not far from zero.\nSee, in particular, Lubik and Matthes (2015), Laubach and Williams (2016), and Johanssen and Mertens\n(2016).\n14 The targeted federal funds rate, currently 0.37 percent, less the 12-month core inflation rate for personal\nconsumption expenditures through April, equals about negative 1.2 percent.\n\n- 14 -\nfalter, the FOMC would be able to provide only a limited amount of additional stimulus\nthrough conventional means.15\nThese motivations notwithstanding, I continue to believe that it will be\nappropriate to gradually reduce the degree of monetary policy accommodation, provided\nthat labor market conditions strengthen further and inflation continues to make progress\ntoward our 2 percent objective. Because monetary policy affects the economy with a lag,\nsteps to withdraw this monetary accommodation ought to be initiated before the FOMC’s\ngoals are fully reached. And if the headwinds that have lingered since the crisis slowly\nabate as I anticipate, this would mean that the neutral rate of interest itself will move up,\nproviding further impetus to gradually increase the federal funds rate. But I stress that\nthe economic outlook, including the pace at which the neutral rate may shift over time, is\nuncertain, so monetary policy cannot proceed on any preset path.16\nThis point is well illustrated by events so far this year. For a time in January and\nearly February, financial markets here and abroad became turbulent and financial\nconditions tightened, reflecting and reinforcing concerns about downside risks to the\nglobal economy. In addition, data received during the winter suggested that U.S. growth\nhad weakened even as progress in the labor market remained solid. Because the\nimplications of these developments for the economic outlook were unclear, the FOMC\n15 There are unconventional policy tools that could be employed to provide further support to aggregate\ndemand, if necessary, and the efficacy and costs of using those tools would be weighed by the FOMC, as\nappropriate. However, so long as these tools are considered imperfect substitutes for the federal funds rate\nas an instrument of policy, the argument that the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates represents\na source of asymmetric risk remains valid.\n16 Uncertainty about where the target range for the federal funds rate will be in the long run provides\nanother reason why increases in policy rates cannot be on a preset path. I view the median value of\n3-1/4 percent from the March SEP as being a reasonable guess for the longer-run normal rate. But FOMC\nparticipants have lowered their estimates of the longer-run normal rate over time, and as new evidence\ncomes in and we see how economic conditions evolve, further changes, in either direction, are likely.\n\n- 15 -\ndecided at its January, March, and April meetings that it would be prudent to maintain the\nexisting target range for the federal funds rate.\nOver the past few months, financial conditions have recovered significantly and\nmany of the risks from abroad have diminished, although some risks remain. In addition,\nconsumer spending appears to have rebounded, providing some reassurance that overall\ngrowth has indeed picked up as expected. Unfortunately, as I noted earlier, new\nquestions about the economic outlook have been raised by the recent labor market data.\nIs the markedly reduced pace of hiring in April and May a harbinger of a persistent\nslowdown in the broader economy? Or will monthly payroll gains move up toward the\nsolid pace they maintained earlier this year and in 2015? Does the latest reading on the\nunemployment rate indicate that we are essentially back to full employment, or does\nrelatively subdued wage growth signal that more slack remains? My colleagues and I\nwill be wrestling with these and other related questions going forward.\nConclusion\nTo summarize, I have explained why I expect the U.S. economy will continue to\nimprove and why I expect that further gradual increases in the federal funds rate will\nprobably be appropriate to best promote the FOMC’s goals of maximum employment and\nprice stability. I have also laid out the considerable and unavoidable uncertainties that\napply to both this outlook for the economy and to the appropriate path of the federal\nfunds rate. My colleagues and I will make our policy decisions based on what incoming\ninformation implies for the economic outlook and the risks to that outlook. What is\ncertain is that monetary policy is not on a preset course, and that the Committee will\nrespond to new data and reassess risks so as to best achieve our goals.\n\n- 16 -\nReferences\nBrynjolfsson, Erik, and Andrew McAfee (2014).

    "text": "Presentation to the Annual AEA/ASSA Conference\nSan Francisco, CA\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on January 4, 2009, 10:15 AM Pacific, 1:15 PM Eastern\nComments on “The Revival of Fiscal Policy”1\nF\nI’m delighted to have the opportunity to comment on the papers of my\ndistinguished colleagues, Martin Feldstein, John Taylor, and Alan Auerbach at a session\ndevoted to a topic of such critical policy importance. With the U.S. economy in a year-old\nrecession, marked by a particularly sharp contraction in recent months, and ensnared in\nongoing financial market distress, fiscal policy intervention is certainly needed. It is\nimportant that it be informed by the kind of cogent thinking and analysis that these papers\nembody.\nI agree with Marty that the current downturn is likely to be far longer and deeper\nthan the “garden-variety” recession in which GDP bounces back quickly. As Marty points\nout, a defining characteristic of this downturn is its cause. Typically, recessions occur\nwhen monetary policy is tightened to subdue the inflationary pressures that emerge during\na boom. This time, the cause was the eruption of a severe financial crisis. Cross-country\nevidence suggests that, following such an event, GDP remains subdued for an extended\nperiod.2 And consistent with this evidence, many forecasters expect this to be one of the\nF F\n1 The views expressed here are my own and do not necessarily represent those of my colleagues in the\nFederal Reserve System. I would like to thank the staff of the San Francisco Fed’s Economic Research\nDepartment, and John Fernald and John Judd in particular, for outstanding support in developing these\nremarks.\n2 See, for example, Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff, “Is the 2007 U.S. Subprime Crisis So\nDifferent?” American Economic Review Papers and Proceedings 98(2), May 2008, or International\nMonetary Fund, World Economic Outlook, October 2008, Chapter 4. (http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/\nweo/2008/02/pdf/text.pdf).\n\nlongest and deepest recessions since the Great Depression. Indeed, the crisis is ongoing.\nRisk-aversion in financial markets remains exceptionally high; deleveraging is widespread;\nthe markets for most private asset-backed securities are dysfunctional; financial\ninstitutions, both large and small, have failed; and the economic downturn is causing\ndelinquencies to rise, threatening further financial distress; households and businesses face\nan ongoing credit crunch; and housing and financial wealth has plunged. Marty points out,\nand I agree, that the likely impact on consumer spending of the decline in wealth thus far—\none of a number of factors weighing on this sector—is, on its own, quite substantial. And\nhouse prices are continuing to slide.\nThe Federal Reserve has responded aggressively since the onset of the crisis with\nboth interest rate reductions and a variety of new, specialized liquidity facilities to improve\nthe functioning of impaired financial markets. At the FOMC’s last meeting in December,\nthe Committee reduced its target for the federal funds rate to a range of 0 to ¼ percent,\neffectively hitting the “zero bound” for the first time since the Great Depression. With\nnominal interest rates now essentially zero, we have reached the limits of what\nconventional monetary policy, working through short-term interest rates, can do to\nstimulate the economy. A special concern in the current circumstances is that a decline in\ninflationary expectations could cause real interest rates to rise. The potential for real\ninterest rates to rise as inflation declines creates a significant downside risk because, with\nan extended period of abnormally high unemployment in the forecast, it is increasingly\nlikely that inflation will fall to undesirably low levels. This is an additional consideration\nthat, to my mind, militates in favor of strong policy responses.\n2\n\nI certainly agree with John Taylor that the zero bound doesn’t mean that monetary\npolicy has run out of options. At another session this afternoon, I will discuss in detail a\nrange of non-conventional measures, using the Fed’s “balance sheet,” that will be a prime\nfocus for monetary policy going forward. The Fed has already announced or undertaken,\nand can expand, programs designed to improve the functioning of credit markets. These\nprograms complement the actions of the Treasury, the FDIC, and the Fed to inject capital\ninto the banking system, to stabilize systemically important financial institutions, to expand\ndeposit insurance, and to temporarily guarantee the senior debt of banking organizations.\nA clear lesson of history is that a sine qua non for sustained economic recovery following a\nfinancial crisis is a thoroughgoing repair of the financial system. The necessary steps are\noccurring now, but restoration of the financial system to full health will be a long, drawn-\nout process.\nLess clear, and here I part ways with John, are the lessons from Japan’s recent\nexperience with “quantitative easing.” In his paper for this session, John asserts that the\nBOJ’s quantitative easing strategy worked well, while fiscal policy was ineffective. My\ninterpretation of the evidence is exactly the opposite. The BOJ targeted an extraordinarily\nhigh level of excess reserves in the banking system, in the hope that a flood of such\nreserves might stimulate additional bank lending. The BOJ’s quantitative easing policy\nprobably had some beneficial effect, but mainly because it symbolized the BOJ’s\ncommitment to combat deflation by keeping interest rates at zero for an extended time.\nThe expectation of an extended period of zero short-term interest rates was probably\ninstrumental in lowering longer-term nominal rates. But the expansion of excess reserves\nto extraordinary levels appears, on its own, to have had very little impact on financial\n3\n\nconditions. The Fed’s “balance sheet” strategy has a different motivation. We are focused\non pursuing carefully tailored programs to remedy specific financial market dysfunctions.\nFor example, our suite of programs is designed to enhance liquidity in financial markets, to\nimprove the availability of term funding in the money market, to restore the functioning of\nthe commercial paper market, and to stimulate the issuance of new asset-backed securities\nto support lending to consumers and small businesses.\nI am sanguine that the Fed’s new programs will be helpful in restoring credit flows.\nBut many of the new approaches are experimental, and there is a great deal of uncertainty\nconcerning their likely effects. Even with vigorous Fed action to restore credit flows, an\nextended period of economic weakness is likely. This explains why, in the statement\nfollowing its December meeting, the FOMC noted that it anticipates that an exceptionally\nlow level of the federal funds rate will be appropriate for some time.\nFor all of these reasons, I support Marty’s conclusion that there is an exceptionally\nstrong case for substantial fiscal stimulus over the next few years. In ordinary\ncircumstances, there are good reasons why monetary, rather than fiscal policy, should be\nused for stabilization purposes. But these are exceptional circumstances, and fiscal policy\ncan help get the economy going.\nGiven that a substantial fiscal stimulus package is now under consideration, it is\nimportant for economists to debate the form it should take and raise questions about the\nlikely effectiveness of particular fiscal strategies. With respect to optimal fiscal design, I\nhave heard more alliterative mantras during the past year than at any time in my\nprofessional career! A year ago, the mantra was “Timely, targeted, and temporary.” More\n4\n\nrecently, I’ve heard “Speedy, substantial, and sustained.”3 In recent testimony, John\nF F\nargued for fiscal policies that are “Permanent, pervasive, and predictable.” 4 And the\nF F\naward for the longest, most detailed, and least alliterative list goes to the International\nMonetary Fund whose staff this week recommended a package that is “large, lasting,\ndiversified, contingent, collective, and sustainable.” 5\nF F\nConceptually, I would note that fiscal policy can play two logically distinct roles in\nthe present crisis. The first, which is the main topic of the papers in this session and my\nsubsequent comments, is to support aggregate demand. I will discuss some issues that\nshould be considered in formulating a stimulus package for this purpose. The second,\nwhich is crucially important in the current crisis, is to address the maladies that now afflict\nthe financial sector. Indeed, fiscal resources have already been deployed to bolster the\ncapital of the banking system, to stabilize systemically important institutions, and to\nsupport programs designed to assist homeowners and mitigate foreclosure. Fiscal policy\ncan play a further supportive role in unclogging credit market flows. For example, the new\nTerm Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) is a joint program between the\nFederal Reserve and the Treasury, using TARP funds, and is designed to improve the flow\nof credit to households and businesses. The Fed cannot conduct such programs on its own,\nsince taxpayer funds are at risk. As I noted earlier, the resolution of financial sector\n3 Lawrence Summers, November 2008, quoted at http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2008/11/17/summerss-\nnew-view-on-stimulus-sustained-not-temporary/ (downloaded December 31, 2008).\n4 John Taylor, “The State of the Economy and Principles for Fiscal Stimulus,” Testimony before the\nCommittee on the Budget, United States Senate, November 19, 2008.

This\nconclusion is endorsed by the IMF in its recent position paper.6\nF F\nLet me now turn to some design issues that relate to the use of fiscal policy for\nstabilization purposes. First, as both John and Alan highlight, automatic stabilizers have an\nimportant role to play, and this role could be expanded. These stabilizers have the\ndesirable property of being predictable and automatic—agents know they’re coming, and\nthey inevitably provide a boost just when it’s needed. Using aggregate CBO data on the\ncyclical contribution to the budget deficit, John argues that these stabilizers are as effective\nas ever; it is hard, though, to square this finding with Alan’s analysis showing that the\nautomatic stabilizers have become smaller over time, as marginal tax rates have declined.\nIn the current context, however, I don’t think that existing automatic stabilizers—of\nwhatever size—are likely to provide a sufficient boost to aggregate demand. Moreover,\nboth John and Alan make the important point that the predictable fiscal policy response to\nchanging economic conditions does not rely solely on automatic stabilizers. Alan\nhighlights the specific examples of countercyclical fiscal policy in the 2000s, as well as the\npredictable component over a long period of time in discretionary investment incentives.\nJohn notes, but does not emphasize, that the structural component of the budget deficit—\nreflecting specific, discretionary changes in legislation—has been highly responsive over\nthe past decade or longer to changes in the output gap.\nHence, private agents rationally expect that in times of economic weakness, fiscal\npolicy will respond and that expectation itself serves as a kind of automatic stabilizer in its\nown right, reassuring households and businesses that the government will do everything in\n6 See Spilimbergo et al., 2008.\n6\n\nits power to prevent a long period of intense economic distress. Agents have almost surely,\nat least implicitly, built some such expectation about discretionary fiscal policy into their\ncurrent behavior, even if they are highly uncertain about the details of the response.\nPerhaps it would be desirable in the longer run to make the policy rule more explicit and\npredictable—and, as Alan emphasizes, to devote more analysis to understanding the effects\nof different policy rules. But I don’t think now is the time to change the implicit, if\nimprecise, rules and disappoint agents’ expectations about the discretionary fiscal response\nto the present crisis.\nA second design principle that must be kept in mind, given the huge, long-term\nbudget challenges facing the country, is that current responses need to be consistent with\nlong-term fiscal discipline. Conceptually, the choices about the long-term size of\ngovernment—with revenues that are consistent with the desired level of spending—and the\nchoices about the optimal short-run stimulus are quite separate. But long-run expectations\nabout fiscal sustainability do matter, even in the short run. If agents don’t believe that tax\ncuts and/or spending increases are temporary, and are concerned that policy responses\nthreaten the sustainability of the long-run run budget picture, then long-term real interest\nrates are likely to rise in response, undercutting, conceivably even overwhelming, the\nshort-term stimulus. In the 1990s, the term “Rubinomics” came to summarize this\npossibility (in reverse): that “contractionary” measures to improve long-run fiscal balance\ncould provide net, short-term stimulus through this channel.\nIn the present context, this logic creates potential tradeoffs between short-run and\nlong-run considerations. In particular, the permanent income hypothesis implies that\npermanent tax cuts affect spending in the short run by more than temporary tax cuts; but if\n7\n\nthese tax cuts are not consistent with long-run spending realities, then they are inconsistent\nwith fiscal sustainability and are not credible. For this reason, I am a bit skeptical about\nMarty’s suggestion that we implement broad-based, permanent tax cuts. Especially given\nfuture obligations for social security and Medicare, voters and legislators might resist the\nsizeable reductions in other spending that would be required to keep taxes permanently\nlower than current legislation implies.\nOf course, a concern for fiscal discipline is one reason why temporary tax rebates\nseemed desirable to many observers last year. The rebates were explicitly targeted at lower-\nincome individuals who were more likely to be credit constrained and thus responsive to\ntemporary as well as permanent changes in income. Some micro evidence suggests that the\nrebates were effective in boosting spending.7 On the basis of aggregate data, however,\nF F\nboth Marty and John agree that the tax rebates were a bust—they failed to have enough of\nan impact on consumer spending to make a dent in the aggregate spending data. There are\ndifficult econometric issues here—for example, credit constraints on households were\ntightening around the same time the checks were arriving, which could have obscured the\ntrue effects. Nevertheless, the rebate checks at best delayed the most severe period of the\ncurrent recession, and at worst were ineffective.\nHow about investment incentives? In contrast to temporary tax rebates, economic\ntheory implies that temporary investment incentives should be even more effective in\nstimulating aggregate demand than permanent incentives. Hence, they should work well in\nterms of providing large short-term bang for the buck with little damage to long-run fiscal\n7 Christian Broda and Jonathan Parker (2008), “The Impact of the 2008 Tax Rebates on Consumer\nSpending: Preliminary Evidence,” mimeo University of Chicago, GSB, July 2008.\nhttp://faculty.chicagogsb.edu/christian.broda/website/research/unrestricted/Stimulus%20Payments%20and\n%20Spending.pdf.\n8\n\nbalance. Unfortunately, Alan’s work suggests that, while this logic might hold, it isn’t the\nwhole story. Investment incentives are clearly countercyclical—when the economy slows,\ninvestment incentives rise and firms contemplating capital investment know this. So the\nanticipation effects could cause undesirable fluctuations in investment and economic\nactivity.\nIn theory, as Marty suggests, temporary increases in government spending—or,\nperhaps, changes in the timing of government spending—fit the bill well. Such spending\nhas the advantage of hitting aggregate demand directly. There is uncertainty in the\nacademic literature about the multiplier, although I think that the multiplier is likely to be\nlarger than usual now because private spending is less likely than usual to be crowded out.\nOf course, it is unclear how quickly temporary spending programs can be ramped up and,\nas Marty suggests, there could be bottlenecks of various sorts.\nTogether, these considerations reinforce the IMF’s recent suggestion that a\ndiversified package of policies should be deployed. That is, within the class of fiscally\nsustainable policies, there is considerable uncertainty about the effects of any individual\npolicy. So we should try a lot of things, including, as Marty suggests, government\nspending.\nOf course, there are many things the government could spend money on and this\nbrings me to a third design principle: Policy should aim to promote spending on goods and\nservices with higher rather than lower social value. After all, the goal of policy is to raise\nwelfare. And spending money on projects that aren’t viewed as having much social value\n—such as digging holes and filling them in again—adds a lot less to social welfare than\n9\n\navailable alternatives, even if such low-value activities can succeed in increasing aggregate\ndemand. Tax cuts do have the advantage of giving individuals the choice about how to\nspend their money. But, as I’ve already noted, it is unclear whether fiscally sustainable tax\ncuts will have sufficient stimulative effect.\nIn this context, as Marty’s argument implies, there are clear macroeconomic gains\nfrom direct government spending. In cost-benefit terms, the aggregate demand\nexternalities increase the benefits of government spending relative to the costs. Hence,\nprograms that already look worthwhile ought to be implemented; and some programs that\nmight not otherwise pass a cost-benefit test could also be justified given the considerable\nslack in the economy. There are real dangers, however, in pushing this logic too far and\nJapan’s experience, to my mind, illustrates them. John suggested that discretionary fiscal\npolicy made no meaningful contribution to Japan’s recovery. I disagree with that\ncharacterization. Japan’s decision to raise its consumption tax and cut public spending in\n1997 aborted an incipient recovery then in progress; and the fiscal stimulus put in place in\n1998 and 1999 appears to have prompted a rebound. Most studies find that fiscal measures\ndid have a positive stimulative effect, although estimates of the fiscal multipliers vary.8\nF F\nEven so, I have the impression that John’s view is widely held in Japan. I suspect that\nfiscal policy was both unpopular, and widely viewed as ineffective, in Japan because so\nmuch of it involved spending on “bridges to nowhere”—public works projects of dubious\nsocial value. Such spending appears to have undermined popular support for fiscal\nstimulus.\n8 This is consistent with the view expressed in Spilimbergo et al. (2008, page 25).\n10\n\nIf ever, in my professional career, there was a time for active, discretionary fiscal\nstimulus, it is now. Although our economy is resilient and has bounced back quickly from\ndownturns in the past, the financial and economic firestorm we face today poses a serious\nrisk of an extended period of stagnation—a very grim outcome. Such stagnation would\nintensify financial market strains, exacerbating the problems that triggered the downturn.\nIt’s worth pulling out all the stops to ensure those outcomes don’t occur.\n11",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n3:00 p.m. EST (noon PST)\nJanuary 18, 2017\nThe Goals of Monetary Policy and How We Pursue Them\nRemarks by\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Commonwealth Club\nSan Francisco, California\nJanuary 18, 2017\n\nGood afternoon. It is a pleasure to join all of you at the Commonwealth Club\ntoday, not the least because the club and the Federal Reserve have a few things in\ncommon. Both organizations, as it happens, have a board of governors and a chair. And\nboth the club’s and the Fed’s histories extend back more than a century. The club, as\nmany here know, was founded in 1903, and the Federal Reserve a decade later. Perhaps\nbecause of our shared origins in the Progressive Era, a period of reform in American life,\nwe hold certain values in common. According to your website, the club is nonpartisan\nand dedicated to the impartial discussion of issues important to your community and the\nnation. At the Fed, we too are nonpartisan and focused squarely on the public interest.\nWe strive to conduct our deliberations impartially and base our decisions on factual\nevidence and objective analysis. This afternoon I will discuss some challenges we’ve\nfaced in our recent deliberations and may face in the next few years.\nPerhaps, though, it is best to start by stepping back and asking, what is--and,\nimportantly, what isn’t--our job as the nation’s central bank? And how do we go about\ntrying to accomplish it? The Federal Reserve has an array of responsibilities. I’ll\nmention our principal duties and then focus on one--monetary policy, the responsibility\nthat gets the most public attention.\nIn addition to monetary policy, we--in collaboration with other regulatory\nagencies at both the federal and state levels--oversee banks and some other financial\ninstitutions to ensure they operate safely and soundly and treat their customers fairly. We\nmonitor the financial system as a whole and promote its stability to help avoid financial\ncrises that could choke off credit to consumers and businesses. We also reliably and\nsafely process trillions of dollars of payments for the nation’s banks and the federal\n\n- 2 -\ngovernment and ensure that banks have an ample supply of currency and coin to meet the\ndemands of their depositors. And we work with communities, nonprofit organizations,\nlenders, educators, and others to encourage financial and economic literacy, promote\nequal access to credit, and advance economic and community development.\nBut, as I noted, monetary policy draws the most headlines. What is monetary\npolicy, exactly? Simply put, it consists of central bank actions aimed at influencing\ninterest rates and financial conditions more generally. Its purpose is to help foster a\nhealthy economy. But monetary policy cannot, by itself, create a healthy economy. It\ncannot, for instance, educate young people, generate technological breakthroughs, make\nworkers and businesses more productive, or address the root causes of inequality.\nFundamentally, the energy, ingenuity, and know-how of American workers and\nentrepreneurs, along with our natural resources, create prosperity. Regulatory policy and\nfiscal policy--the decisions by the Administration and the Congress about how much and\nhow the government spends, taxes, and borrows--can influence these more fundamental\neconomic pillars.\nI’ve said what monetary policy cannot do. But what can it do? It can lean against\ndamaging fluctuations in the economy. Nearly 40 years ago, the Congress set two main\nguideposts for that task--maximum employment and price stability. We refer to these\nassigned goals as our dual mandate. When the economy is weak and unemployment is on\nthe rise, we encourage spending and investing by pushing short-term interest rates lower.\nAs you may know, the interest rate that we target is the federal funds rate, the rate banks\ncharge each other for overnight loans. Lowering short-term rates in turn puts downward\npressure on longer-term interest rates, making credit more affordable--for families, for\n\n- 3 -\ninstance, to buy a house or for businesses to expand. Similarly, when the economy is\nthreatening to push inflation too high down the road, we increase interest rates to keep the\neconomy on a sustainable path and lean against its tendency to boom and then bust.\nBut what exactly do the terms “maximum employment” and “price stability”\nmean? Does maximum employment mean that every single person who wants a job has a\njob? No. There are always a certain number of people who are temporarily between jobs\nafter having recently lost a job or having left one voluntarily to pursue better\nopportunities. Others may have just graduated and have started looking for a job or have\ndecided to return to working--for instance, when their child starts school. This so-called\nfrictional unemployment is evident even in the healthiest of economies.\nThen there is structural unemployment--a difficult problem both for the people\naffected and for policymakers trying to address it. Sometimes people are ready and\nwilling to work, but their skills, perhaps because of technological advances, are not a\ngood fit for the jobs that are available. Or suitable jobs may be available but are not close\nto where they and their families live. These are factors over which monetary policy has\nlittle influence. Other measures--such as job training and other workforce development\nprograms--are better suited to address structural unemployment.\nAfter taking account of both frictional and structural unemployment, what\nunemployment rate is roughly equivalent to the maximum level of employment that can\nbe sustained in the longer run? The rate can change over time as the economy evolves,\nbut, for now, many economists, including my colleagues at the Fed and me, judge that it\nis around 4-3/4 percent. It’s important to try to estimate the unemployment rate that is\n\n- 4 -\nequivalent to maximum employment because persistently operating below it pushes\ninflation higher, which brings me to our price stability mandate.\nDoes price stability mean having no inflation whatsoever? Again, the answer is\nno. By “price stability,” we mean a level of inflation that is low and stable enough that it\ndoesn’t need to figure prominently into people’s and businesses’ economic decisions.\nBased on research and decades of experience, we define that level as 2 percent a year--an\ninflation objective similar to that adopted by most other major central banks.1 Individual\nprices, of course, move up and down by more than 2 percent all the time. Such\nmovements are essential to a well-functioning economy. They allow supply and demand\nto adjust for various goods and services. By “inflation,” we mean price changes as a\nwhole for all of the various goods and services that households consume.\nNo one likes high inflation, and it is easy to understand why. Although wages\nand prices tend to move in tandem over long periods, inflation erodes household\npurchasing power if it is not matched with similar increases in wages, and it eats away\nthe value of households’ savings. So, then, why don’t we and other central banks aim for\nzero inflation? There are several technical reasons, but a more fundamental reason is to\ncreate a buffer against the opposite of inflation--that is, deflation. Deflation is a general\nand persistent decline in the level of prices, a phenomenon Americans last experienced\nduring the Great Depression of the 1930s and one that Japan has confronted for most of\nthe past two decades. Deflation can feed on itself, leading to economic stagnation or\nworse. It puts pressure on employers to either cut wages or cut jobs. And it can be very\nhard on borrowers, who find themselves repaying their loans with dollars that are worth\n1 Our objective is 2 percent inflation as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal con-\nsumption expenditures published by the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n\n- 5 -\nmore than the dollars they originally borrowed. I am sure we all remember learning in\nschool about farm families in the Great Depression who couldn’t pay their mortgages and\nlost their homes and their livelihoods when crop prices fell persistently.\nAnother important reason to maintain a modest inflation buffer is that too low\ninflation impairs the ability of monetary policy to counter economic downturns. When\ninflation is very low, interest rates tend to be very low also, even in good times. And\nwhen interest rates are generally very low, the Fed has only limited room to cut them to\nhelp the economy in bad times.\nIn a nutshell, the Fed’s goal is to promote financial conditions conducive to\nmaximum employment and price stability. And I have offered broad-brush definitions of\neach of those objectives. So where is the economy now, in relationship to them? The\nshort answer is, we think it’s close. The economy has come a long way since the\nfinancial crisis. As you know, the crisis marked the start of a very deep recession. It\ndestroyed nearly 9 million jobs, and it’s been a long, slow slog to recover from it.\nUnemployment peaked at 10 percent late in 2009, a level unseen for more than 25 years,\nand didn’t move below 8 percent for nearly three years. Falling home prices put millions\nof homeowners “underwater,” meaning they owed more on their mortgages than their\nhomes were worth. And the stock market plunged, slashing the value of 401(k)\nretirement nest eggs.\nThe extraordinarily severe recession required an extraordinary response from\nmonetary policy, both to support the job market and prevent deflation. We cut our short-\nterm interest rate target to near zero at the end of 2008 and kept it there for seven years.\nTo provide further support to American households and businesses, we pressed down on\n\n- 6 -\nlonger-term interest rates by purchasing large amounts of longer-term Treasury securities\nand government-guaranteed mortgage securities. And we communicated our intent to\nkeep short-term interest rates low for a long time, thus increasing the downward pressure\non longer-term interest rates, which are influenced by expectations about short-term rates.\nNow, it’s fair to say, the economy is near maximum employment and inflation is\nmoving toward our goal. The unemployment rate is less than 5 percent, roughly back to\nwhere it was before the recession. And, over the past seven years, the economy has\nadded about 15-1/2 million net new jobs. Although inflation has been running below our\n2 percent objective for quite some time, we have seen it start inching back toward\n2 percent last year as the job market continued to improve and as the effects of a big drop\nin oil prices faded. Last month, at our most recent meeting, we took account of the\nconsiderable progress the economy has made by modestly increasing our short-term\ninterest rate target by 1/4 percentage point to a range of 1/2 to 3/4 percent. It was the\nsecond such step--the first came a year earlier--and reflects our confidence the economy\nwill continue to improve.\nNow, many of you would love to know exactly when the next rate increase is\ncoming and how high rates will rise. The simple truth is, I can’t tell you because it will\ndepend on how the economy actually evolves over coming months. The economy is vast\nand vastly complex, and its path can take surprising twists and turns. What I can tell you\nis what we expect--along with a very large caveat that our interest rate expectations will\nchange as our outlook for the economy changes. That said, as of last month, I and most\nof my colleagues--the other members of the Fed Board in Washington and the presidents\nof the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks--were expecting to increase our federal funds\n\n- 7 -\nrate target a few times a year until, by the end of 2019, it is close to our estimate of its\nlonger-run neutral rate of 3 percent.\nThe term “neutral rate” requires some explaining. It is the rate that, once the\neconomy has reached our objectives, will keep the economy on an even keel. It is neither\npressing on the gas pedal to make the car go faster nor easing off so much that the car\nslows down. Right now our foot is still pressing on the gas pedal, though, as I noted, we\nhave eased back a bit. Our foot remains on the pedal in part because we want to make\nsure the economic expansion remains strong enough to withstand an unexpected shock,\ngiven that we don’t have much room to cut interest rates. In addition, inflation is still\nrunning below our 2 percent objective, and, by some measures, there may still be some\nroom for progress in the job market. For instance, wage growth has only recently begun\nto pick up and remains fairly low. A broader measure of unemployment isn’t quite back\nto its pre-recession level. It includes people who would like a job but have been too\ndiscouraged to look for one and people who are working part time but would rather work\nfull time.\nNevertheless, as the economy approaches our objectives, it makes sense to\ngradually reduce the level of monetary policy support. Changes in monetary policy take\ntime to work their way into the economy. Waiting too long to begin moving toward the\nneutral rate could risk a nasty surprise down the road--either too much inflation, financial\ninstability, or both. In that scenario, we could be forced to raise interest rates rapidly,\nwhich in turn could push the economy into a new recession.\nThe factors I have just discussed are the usual sort that central bankers consider as\neconomies move through a recovery. But a longer-term trend--slow productivity\n\n- 8 -\ngrowth--helps explain why we don’t think dramatic interest rate increases are required to\nmove our federal funds rate target back to neutral. Labor productivity--that is, the output\nof goods and services per hour of work--has increased by only about 1/2 percent a year,\non average, over the past six years or so and only 1-1/4 percent a year over the past\ndecade. That contrasts with the previous 30 years when productivity grew a bit more\nthan 2 percent a year. This productivity slowdown matters enormously because\nAmericans’ standard of living depends on productivity growth. With productivity growth\nof 2 percent a year, the average standard of living will double roughly every 35 years.\nThat means our children can reasonably hope to be better off economically than we are\nnow. But productivity growth of 1 percent a year means the average standard of living\nwill double only every 70 years.\nEconomists do not fully understand the causes of the productivity slowdown.\nSome emphasize that technological progress and its diffusion throughout the economy\nseem to be slower over the past decade or so. Others look at college graduation rates,\nwhich have flattened out after rising rapidly in previous generations. And still others\nfocus on a dramatic slowing in the creation of new businesses, which are often more\ninnovative than established firms. While each of these factors has likely played a role in\nslowing productivity growth, the extent to which they will continue to do so is an open\nquestion.2\nWhy does slow productivity growth, if it persists, imply a lower neutral interest\nrate? First, it implies that the economy’s usual rate of output growth, when employment\n2 Other factors depressing the neutral rate include housing construction and lackluster exports. Housing\nstill hasn’t fully recovered from the financial crisis, in part because mortgage-qualification standards\nremain tight. Weak growth abroad in Europe, China, and elsewhere, some of which is related to their own\nproductivity challenges, has hurt sales of U.S. goods.\n\n- 9 -\nis at its maximum and prices are stable, will be significantly slower than the post-World\nWar II average. Slower economic growth, in turn, implies businesses will see less need\nto invest in expansion. And it implies families and individuals will feel the need to save\nmore and spend less. Because interest rates are the mechanism that brings the supply of\nsavings and the demand for investment funds into balance, more saving and less\ninvestment imply a lower neutral interest rate. Although we can’t directly measure the\nneutral interest rate, it is something that can be estimated in retrospect. And, as we have\nincreasingly realized, it has probably been trending down for a while now. Our current 3\npercent estimate of the longer-run neutral rate, for instance, is a full percentage point\nlower than our estimate just three years ago.\nYou might be thinking, what does this discussion of rather esoteric concepts such\nas the neutral rate mean to me? If you are a borrower, it means that, although the interest\nrates you pay on, say, your auto loan or mortgage or credit card likely will creep higher,\nthey probably will not increase dramatically. Likewise, if you are a saver, the rates you\nearn could inch higher after a while, but probably not by a lot. For some years, I’ve\nheard from savers who want higher rates, and now I’m beginning to hear from borrowers\nwho want lower rates. I can’t emphasize strongly enough, though, that we are not trying\nto help one of those groups at the expense of the other. We’re focused very much on that\ndual mandate I keep mentioning. At the end of the day, we all benefit from plentiful jobs\nand stable prices, whether we are savers or borrowers--and many of us, of course, are\nboth.\nEconomics and monetary policy are, at best, inexact sciences. Figuring out what\nthe neutral interest rate is and setting the right path toward it is not like setting the\n\n- 10 -\nthermostat in a house: You can’t just set the temperature at 68 degrees and walk away.\nAnd, because changes in monetary policy affect the economy with long lags sometimes,\nwe must base our decisions on our best forecasts of an uncertain future. Thus, we must\ncontinually reassess and adjust our policies based on what we learn.\nThat point leads me to repeat what I said when I began: Like the Commonwealth\nClub, the Federal Reserve was created more than a century ago during an era of\ngovernment reform to serve the public interest. The structure established for the Federal\nReserve back then intentionally insulates us from short-term political pressures so we can\nfocus on what’s best for the American economy in the longer run. I promise you, with\nthe sometimes imperfect information and evidence we have available, we will do just that\nby making the best decisions we can, as objectively as we can.\nThank you. I welcome your questions.",

    "text": "Presentation to the Financial Women’s Association\nSan Francisco, CA\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on January 15, 2009, 12:40 PM Pacific, 3:40 PM Eastern\nThe Outlook for 2009:\nEconomic Turmoil and Policy Responses1\nGood afternoon, and thank you for inviting me to speak to you today. I am very\npleased that one of my first speeches of the year is to the Financial Women’s Association.\nThose of you who work in the financial sector are keenly aware of the problems we now\nface in the financial markets and the economy, and I very much welcome your questions\nand insights.\nAs you all know, sound, well-functioning financial markets and institutions are\nessential to a sound, well-functioning economy. They provide the credit that firms\nrequire to finance inventory, hire workers, and invest in new capital equipment and that\nhouseholds need to buy houses and cars and to send their kids to college.\nToday, financial markets have, in many cases, broken down and the ramifications\nfor the economy have been severe due to the essential interconnections between the two:\nFinancial distress precipitated a credit crunch, sending the economy into recession. And\nweakness in the economy has intensified financial distress, further diminishing access to\ncredit. These ongoing, negative dynamics create severe downside economic risks, and\nthe perception of intense uncertainty about the future has prompted a loss in confidence,\nleaving households and firms wary about spending. For example, consumers are pulling\nback on purchases, especially on durable goods, to save more, and businesses are\n1\nI would like to thank John Judd, Rob Valletta and Judith Goff for outstanding assistance in preparing\nthese remarks.\n1\n\ncancelling capital investment plans and laying off workers to preserve cash. Such actions\nare sensible on an individual basis, but they intensify economic distress for the economy\nas a whole.\nI consider it imperative for policymakers to act boldly to restore confidence and\nimprove the functioning of financial markets in order to get the economy back on its feet.\nThe Federal Reserve has already implemented aggressive, creative, and substantial\npolicies, and more can be done. In addition, there is now a consensus that the economy\nneeds strong fiscal action, and prospects are good that a federal stimulus program will be\nforthcoming. Finally, I am heartened that policymakers around the world are responding\nforcefully and cooperatively to address the financial and economic crisis as it has spread\nthroughout the global economy. My goal today is to give you my perspective on the\nfinancial and economic turmoil and to discuss and explain the policy responses and their\nrationales. As always, my comments represent my own views and not necessarily those\nof my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nEconomic conditions\nI will begin with a review of current economic conditions. Unfortunately, there is\nnot much good news to report. Recent data indicate that, over a year into the current\nrecession, the U.S. economy is still contracting sharply. For example, the latest Blue\nChip consensus estimates that output declined at an annual rate of over 5 percent last\nquarter and is likely to continue contracting, at a pace exceeding 3 percent, in the current\nquarter.\n2\n\nEconomic weakness is evident in every sector of the economy. After declining\nslightly in the third quarter, real personal consumption expenditures appear to have fallen\nmore sharply in the fourth. Such retrenchment in consumer spending is understandable,\ngiven the truly tough conditions that households face, but especially troubling because\nthis sector represents over 70 percent of GDP. With respect to jobs, employment has\ndeclined for twelve months in a row, and the unemployment rate now stands at 7¼\npercent up from 5 percent just a year ago. With respect to wealth, the combined impact\nof falling equity and house prices has been staggering. Household wealth has declined by\nan estimated $10 trillion. With respect to consumer credit, it is both costlier and harder to\nget. Not surprisingly, consumer confidence is at a 30-year low and the personal saving\nrate is on the rise, as people try to rebuild their wealth and provide a cushion against the\npossibility of job loss. The recent plunge in vehicle sales, in spite of lower gas prices and\nhuge price incentives, reflects this lack of confidence as well as the difficulties people are\nhaving in getting auto loans.\nBusiness spending is also feeling the crunch, as firms face weak demand for their\nproducts, a higher cost of capital, and restricted credit. In particular, many companies,\nespecially those with lower credit ratings, are experiencing difficulty borrowing in the\ncommercial paper market, an important source of short-term funding. Bank lines of\ncredit reportedly are more difficult to negotiate, trade credit is being restricted, and many\nfirms have become cautious in managing liquidity and in committing to capital spending\nprojects. Some companies are drawing down existing credit lines to have cash on hand in\ncase these lines are capped by their bank. This caution has spread to venture capital\nspending as well, where activity has dropped significantly; in consequence, information\n3\n\ntechnology and biotech companies in Silicon Valley and elsewhere are scaling back on\nbusiness expansion plans.\nNonresidential construction, surprisingly enough, has continued to show some\ngrowth up to this point, but this is not likely to last much longer. I’m hearing talk about\nsubstantial cutbacks on new projects and planned capital improvements on existing\nbuildings for two all-too-familiar reasons—demand is falling as the economy weakens\nand financing is hard to get. In particular, the market for commercial mortgage-backed\nsecurities, a mainstay for financing large projects, has all but dried up. Banks and other\ntraditional lenders have also become less willing to extend funding.\nAlthough residential investment accounts for under 5 percent of overall economic\nactivity, the decline in this sector over the past three years has been big enough to create a\nmajor drag on growth. Housing starts have plummeted, falling to nearly one-half of their\nyear-ago level, and it is hard to see when they will bottom out, since inventories of unsold\nnew and existing homes remain at high levels relative to sales. Indeed, the possibility of\nongoing contraction in this sector is intensified by the economic downturn, the loss in\njobs, and the reduced availability of mortgage credit. At this point, the market for\nprivate-label mortgage-backed securities is essentially closed for business, leaving the\ngovernment agencies, especially Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as the main source of\nfunding or backing for conventional conforming mortgages. One piece of good news is\nthat interest rates on conforming mortgages have come down recently in response to a\nnew Federal Reserve program to purchase agency debt and significant quantities of\nagency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities.\n4\n\nThe ongoing decline in house prices is a source of particular concern not only\nbecause of its impact on consumer spending, but also because it contributes importantly\nto delinquencies and foreclosures on subprime and other mortgages. Foreclosures are\nextremely painful for homeowners and create negative spillovers for neighbors and\nafflicted communities. As you may know, some of the earliest and sharpest price\ndeclines nationwide occurred in parts of California and other western states, such as\nArizona and Nevada. Foreclosure rates in these states are well above their historic highs\ndating back at least to the late 1970s, and home prices in the largest metro areas are down\nby as much as 35 to 40 percent from their 2006 peak. Unfortunately, futures contracts for\nhouse prices suggest that further declines are likely this year and next.\nMany state and local governments have been dragged into the financial mess.\nThe downturns in the housing markets and the economy have bitten into tax collections at\nthe same time that the financial market turmoil has made it harder to issue bonds. These\nproblems are particularly acute in California. Despite a successful bond issuance in\nOctober, ongoing erosion in revenues has raised the possibility that the state will run out\nof money in February. The latest projection is for a deficit of about $40 billion that will\naccumulate over the current and next fiscal year. This is a huge shortfall relative to\nannual revenue of $100 billion, and the actions needed to overcome it are only likely to\nadd to the recession in the state.\nMoving from the local to the global, the situation is not much brighter. The\nstrong foreign demand for our exports that gave a major boost to the U.S. economy\nthrough the third quarter of last year is not likely to continue. Economic growth in the\nrest of the world, particularly in Europe and Japan, has weakened sharply for a number of\n5\n\nreasons, including spillovers from the U.S. recession and from the financial meltdown\nthat now has spread globally. In addition, the dollar has appreciated against the euro and\nBritish pound over the past year, offsetting a portion of the depreciation that was\nsupporting U.S. exports. For these reasons, it now looks likely that the data will show\nworldwide recession in late 2008 and early 2009, with a more severe and long-lasting\ncontraction in many industrial countries.\nTo conclude my review of current conditions, let me to turn to inflation. Not so\nlong ago we were worried about rising inflation in the wake of soaring commodity prices.\nThose days are gone. Weaker economic activity around the world has reduced the\ndemand for commodities, pushing their prices, and inflationary pressures, down\nsubstantially. At the same time, rising unemployment and unused industrial capacity are\nalso putting downward pressure on inflation. In fact, with slack in labor and product\nmarkets likely to build significantly over the next couple of years, it seems likely that\ninflation will move, for a time, below levels that are consistent with price stability.\nConventional Federal Reserve policies\nBy now, I hope my remarks have made it clear that the interaction between the\nfinancial shock and the recession, as well as the associated crisis in confidence, present\nextraordinary challenges for policymakers—challenges that certainly are the most\nsignificant and complex since the deep recession in 1980-82, and perhaps since the Great\nDepression. An important lesson from both theory and history is that such circumstances\ncall for prompt and aggressive policy action. I believe we have heeded that lesson,\nresponding vigorously. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has cut its federal\n6\n\nfunds rate target by roughly 5 full percentage points, lowering it essentially to its “zero\nbound,” by establishing a target range of 0 to ¼ percent at its meeting last December.\nFederal Reserve communications policy\nObviously, with the funds rate at the zero bound, the Committee cannot push it any\nlower to stimulate the economy. But that does not mean that the Committee is out of\noptions. An extensive body of literature suggests that communications can play a helpful\nrole in addressing the zero-bound constraint. In particular, by offering guidance about the\nlikely course of future short-term interest rates, conditional on the Committee’s economic\nforecast, the Fed may be able to influence longer-term rates and asset prices. The Fed\nemployed such an approach between 2003 and 2005, and has taken an important step\nalong the same path in its December announcement by stating that “exceptionally low\nlevels of the federal funds rate” are likely to be warranted “for some time” due to “weak\neconomic conditions.”\nCommunication also can be important in the Fed’s efforts to anchor long-term\ninflation expectations. As I mentioned at the outset, the odds are high that over the next\nfew years, inflation will decline below desirable levels. It is especially important in such\ncircumstances for the Fed to emphasize its commitment to returning inflation over time to\nthe higher levels that are most appropriate to the attainment of its longer-term objectives.\nA decline in inflationary expectations when economic conditions are weak is pernicious,\nespecially so when the federal funds rate has reached the zero bound, because any\ndowndrift in inflation expectations leads to an updrift in real interest rates and a\ntightening of financial conditions.\n7\n\nOver the past few years, the FOMC has taken important incremental steps toward\nmaking its longer-term inflation goals more explicit. For example, we are now\npublishing FOMC members’ inflation forecasts for the next three years under the\nassumption of “appropriate monetary policy,” and the publication of such forecasts has\nhelped shape public understanding concerning the range of inflation outcomes that\nFOMC members regard as desirable in the longer term. Looking forward, there could be\nscope for the Committee to improve the clarity of these communications. I am optimistic\nthat, by clearly communicating the Fed’s commitment to low and stable inflation and by\nbacking that commitment up with determined policy actions should the need arise, any\ndeflationary pressures caused by the weak economy can be contained.\nThe Federal Reserve’s balance sheet policies\nBeyond interest rate policy, the Fed has other tools at its disposal to improve the\nfunctioning of financial markets and to lower longer-term interest rates to support private\nspending. Indeed, the Fed has done a lot already through “nonconventional” programs\nthat use its balance sheet. These programs serve two main purposes: first, to provide a\nreliable source of liquidity to financial institutions and markets and second, to augment\nthe flow of credit to the private sector.\nThe provision of liquidity is important to prevent “runs” that create systemic risks\nto the economy as a whole. The Federal Reserve has long fulfilled this “lender of last\nresort” function for commercial banks, which have been protected both with access to the\nFed’s discount window and deposit insurance. In the current crisis, however, systemic\nrisk has been a concern for some financial institutions outside the commercial banking\n8\n\nsector. I am referring particularly to institutions comprising the so-called “shadow\nbanking sector.” This sector includes investment banks that commonly finance their\nsecurities portfolios through very short-term repurchase agreements with money market\nmutual funds and Structured Investment Vehicles (SIVs) and conduits—entities that issue\nshort-term asset-backed commercial paper to fund holdings of higher-yielding asset-\nbacked securities. Entities like these subject the economy to systemic risk, because, like\nbanks, they are subject to runs. Indeed, any institution, however sound, that borrows very\nshort to hold a portfolio of longer-term, illiquid assets may be unable to satisfy the\ndemands of their lenders for repayment when they flee en masse.\nThe Fed’s balance sheet programs are also intended to augment the flow of credit\nto households and firms, thereby offsetting, at least in part, the reduced flow of credit\nfrom financial institutions and markets. One reason that the availability of credit has\ndiminished is because the markets for most asset-backed securities, with the exception of\nagency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities, are highly impaired so that issuance has\ndiminished to a trickle. A second cause of the credit crunch is that financial institutions,\nespecially those in the shadow banking sector are scaling back their balance sheets.\nThese institutions suffer from a shortage of capital—or, to put it another way, are too\nhighly leveraged. Unfortunately, the commercial banking sector is unable to pick up all\nof the slack, in spite of the recent capital injections they have received, because banks are\nafflicted with losses from write-downs of impaired assets and mounting credit losses,\nparticularly on real estate loans.\nI’d like to next sketch out some of the programs that the Fed has already put in\nplace to provide liquidity and increase the flow of credit and address some frequently\n9\n\nasked questions about the Fed’s unconventional policies: Are they working? What is the\nscope for expanding these policies? How does the Fed’s approach compare to the\nquantitative easing policy implemented by the Bank of Japan between 2001 and 2006?\nTo fulfill our role in providing liquidity to financial institutions and markets, we\nhave crossed traditional boundaries by extending the maturity of the loans, the range of\nacceptable collateral, and the range of eligible borrowing institutions. We introduced a\nnew auction system—called the Term Auction Facility (TAF)—to distribute discount\nwindow loans more effectively, and then greatly expanded the size and term of the\nauctions to address a persistent shortage of term funding in the money markets. We have\nalso supported the provision of dollar liquidity beyond our own shores through a vast\nexpansion of our network of swap lines with foreign central banks.\nWe realized early on that stabilizing the financial system would require lending\nnot only to institutions in the traditional banking sector but also to those in the shadow\nbanking sector. Doing so required invoking section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act,\nwhich authorizes lending to nonbanks only in “unusual and exigent circumstances.” For\nexample, it was used to facilitate the acquisition of Bear Stearns and to stabilize AIG and\nCitigroup—three systemically important financial firms. This authority was also used to\nestablish a discount window facility for primary dealers—the Primary Dealer Credit\nFacility (PDCF)—and a new facility to enhance the ability of primary dealers to finance\ntheir securities inventories through the market for repurchase agreements—the Term\nSecurities Lending Facility (TSLF).\nThe collapse of Lehman and the near-collapse of AIG this past fall triggered severe\ndisruptions in short-term money markets, as investors in prime money market mutual\n10\n\nfunds fled to the safety of the shortest-term Treasury securities to the point that the three-\nmonth T-bill rate hovered near zero. These disruptions also triggered dysfunction in the\ncommercial paper market, a large and important source of short-term financing for both\nfinancial and nonfinancial corporations. In response, the Fed set up new facilities to\nprovide liquidity to money market funds and the commercial paper market.\nIn my judgment, the suite of facilities that the Fed has created to improve money\nmarket conditions is working. Conditions are still abnormal, but money market\nfunctioning has improved markedly relative to the dark days of last September and\nOctober. For example, term Libor rates have declined along with the spreads of these\nrates over the federal funds rate. Since term Libor rates are a benchmark for many\nadjustable-rate loans, including mortgages, the benefits of these reductions are rippling\nthroughout the private sector. For highly rated commercial paper eligible for the\nCommercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF), spreads have also narrowed substantially.\nTo improve the flow of credit to the private sector, the Federal Reserve\nannounced several new programs in November. In this arena there remains considerable\nscope for further action. In particular, in support of the housing sector, the Fed\nannounced and commenced a $600 billion program to purchase agency debt and agency-\ninsured mortgage-backed securities. Yields on mortgage-backed securities and 30-year\nfixed-rate mortgages fell substantially right after the program was announced, and these\nrates fell again when the first purchases were made earlier this month. Moreover, there\nhas been an upsurge in refinancing activity in recent weeks. The FOMC could also\nexpand its purchases of longer-term Treasury debt, which might lower government\nborrowing rates and spill over into private borrowing rates more broadly.\n11\n\nThe Fed has developed another very promising program to help restore functioning\nin other impaired financial markets. It is called the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan\nFacility (TALF), and it will support the issuance of securities collateralized by auto,\nstudent, credit card, and SBA, or Small Business Administration loans—sectors where\nthe issuance of new securities has slowed to a trickle. The high borrowing spreads on\nsuch securities, even when the underlying loans are government-guaranteed—as in the\ncase of SBA and many student loans—suggest not only heightened credit risk but also an\nimpairment of market liquidity which the facilities can address. By improving the\nfunctioning of markets for securitized assets, the Fed has the potential to boost private-\nsector credit flows in support of the economy. This new facility is a joint Fed-Treasury\ninitiative; cooperation with the Treasury is necessary because the program entails some\nrisk of loss and, under the Federal Reserve Act, all Fed lending must be appropriately\nsecured.\nThe approach employed by the TALF has the potential to be expanded\nsubstantially, with higher lending volumes and additional asset classes, such as\ncommercial and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities. As I noted, these\nmarkets have all but dried up since the credit crisis began, and the shortage of credit in\nthese critical sectors has made private borrowing costs exceptionally high.\nThe use of the Fed’s balance sheet to stimulate the economy might seem quite a lot\nlike the “quantitative easing” policy pursued by the Bank of Japan in the early 2000s,\nwhen it was at the zero bound. However, to my mind, the differences outweigh the\nsimilarities. The main similarity is that the Fed, like the Bank of Japan, has increased the\ntotal quantity of bank reserves well above the minimum level required to push overnight\n12\n\ninterbank lending rates—in our case, the federal funds rate—to the vicinity of the zero\nbound. The creation of such a large volume of reserves, in the Fed’s case, results from\nthe enormous expansion in discount window lending, foreign exchange swaps, and asset\npurchases through our various liquidity facilities. In the Bank of Japan’s case, the\nexpansion in reserves resulted from the deliberate adoption of an explicit numerical target\nfor them. The concept underlying the Bank of Japan’s intervention was that banks might\nbe encouraged to lend by replacing their holdings of short-term government securities\nwith excess cash. However, near the zero bound, short-term government securities and\ncash are almost perfect substitutes, so exchanging one for the other should have little\neffect on banks’ desire to lend. And the Japanese experience suggests that simply\nexpanding bank reserves—even by a very large amount—had little effect on bank lending\nor on the economy more broadly.\nThe consequence of all of the Fed’s balance sheet initiatives is that our balance\nsheet has ballooned from about $900 billion at the beginning of 2008 to more than $2\ntrillion currently—and is rising. However, the impact of the totality of Fed programs\nshould not be judged by the overall size of the Fed’s balance sheet. Instead, that size will\nbe the result of decisions concerning the appropriate scale of each particular program and\nthe extent to which the various programs and facilities are actually used by market\nparticipants. The take-up rates on these programs and facilities are likely to fluctuate\nover time as market conditions change. For example, early in a new Fed lending\nprogram, its impact on economic activity might rise with the associated expansion of the\nFed’s balance sheet. Later on, if the program helps to improve the functioning of the\nprivate market, success could be associated with the contraction of the Fed’s balance\n13\n\nsheet as the Fed exits from the market, leaving the determination of credit flows to\nprivate participants. Furthermore, the mere availability of backup liquidity through a\nfacility may improve market functioning, even if the volume of borrowing is low.\nFiscal policy\nI’d like to conclude by stepping a bit outside the scope of monetary policy to say a\nfew words about the role of fiscal policy in the current crisis. In ordinary circumstances,\nthere are good reasons why monetary, rather than fiscal, policy should be used for\nstabilization purposes. But we are in extraordinary circumstances, and the case for\nsubstantial fiscal stimulus over the next few years is very strong. First, as I have\nindicated, with the economy contracting significantly, it is time to “pull out all the\nstops”—that is, to deploy both monetary and fiscal policy—to avoid a deep and lingering\nrecession. Second, the case for fiscal stimulus is strengthened by the fact that monetary\npolicy has already moved its short-term interest rate essentially to zero.\nIn fact, a substantial fiscal stimulus package is now under consideration by the\nincoming Obama administration and the Congress, and there will be—and should be—\nvigorous debate about the form it should take and about the likely effectiveness of\nparticular fiscal strategies. While engaging in that debate is not my job today, I would\nnote that fiscal policy can play two logically distinct roles in the present crisis. The first\nis to support aggregate demand. Of course, we don’t know the full details of the bill that\nwill be passed, but the proposed legislation would provide for considerable stimulus—a\ncombination of tax cuts and spending increases perhaps totaling nearly $800 billion.\n14\n\nThe second role, which is important in the current crisis, is to address the\nmaladies that now afflict the financial sector. Indeed, fiscal resources have already been\ndeployed to bolster the capital of the banking system, to stabilize systemically important\ninstitutions, and to support programs designed to assist homeowners and mitigate\nforeclosure. Fiscal policy can play a further supportive role in unclogging credit market\nflows. I have already mentioned one example: the TALF, which is a joint program\nbetween the Fed and the Treasury that uses funds from the Troubled Assets Relief\nProgram (TARP) and is designed to improve the flow of credit to households and\nbusinesses.\nThe resolution of financial sector difficulties, and the stimulus to aggregate\ndemand in our economy, are essential for a return to sustained growth, and I am\nheartened that the Fed and other policymakers in the U.S. and around the world are\ntaking bold steps.\n# # #\n15",

    "text": "Speech to Community Leaders Luncheon\nPortland, Oregon\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery Thursday, July 10, 2008, 12:30 PM Pacific, 3:30 PM Eastern\nRisks and Prospects for the U.S. Economy1\nGood afternoon, everyone, and thank you very much for coming. The topic of my\ntalk today is the nation’s economic outlook. I recently returned from a meeting of the\nFederal Open Market Committee, where we voted to leave our policy target, the federal\nfunds rate, unchanged for the time being. The discussion around the table focused on\nthree developments that for some time have been presenting serious challenges to the\nFederal Reserve in meeting its dual mandate of low and stable inflation and maximum\nsustainable employment and economic growth. These three developments, of course, are\nthe housing slump, the financial market turmoil and ensuing credit crunch, and the surge\nin commodity prices, especially oil prices.\nToday I’d like to give you my own perspective on these developments, focusing\non where things stand now, their likely impact on the near-term outlook for economic\nactivity and inflation, and their implications for monetary policy.\nBefore discussing the current economic situation—that is, where things stand\nnow—let me set the stage by describing briefly how we got here. To get a little fanciful\nwith the stage-setting metaphor for a moment, it is a bit like the opening of Macbeth, with\nthe three ghastly witches brewing up trouble amid thunder and lightning—only here, the\nthree troublemakers are the housing market, the financial markets, and commodity prices.\nThe housing market has been declining for a few years now. For example, residential\n1 These remarks represent my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve\nSystem. I would like to thank the Economic Research staff for support in preparing these remarks, and in\nparticular, John Fernald, Fred Furlong, Reuven Glick, Rob Valletta, and Judith Goff.\n\ninvestment has fallen by more than a third, in inflation-adjusted terms, since the end of\n2005. And house prices have tumbled—according to the various Case-Shiller home price\nindices, they are down some 15 to 20 percent over the past two years. For the first couple\nof years, the housing downturn appears to have had remarkably few spillovers to the rest\nof the economy in terms of curtailed spending. However, knock-on effects to the\nfinancial sector were brewing, for as house prices continued to fall, home mortgage\ndelinquencies started to rise. Indeed, the subprime mortgage market, which took off after\n2001 and ran strong through late 2005 largely on the expectation of continued home price\nappreciation, is now in shambles. After posting delinquency rates in the single digits in\n2005, around 20 percent of subprime mortgages are currently delinquent or in foreclosure\nnationwide.\nLast summer, it became clear that losses on subprime and other mortgages would\nbe far higher than markets had anticipated. This realization contributed to a broad\nreappraisal of credit market risks, which sparked the severe, ongoing financial market\ncrisis and credit crunch.\nMeanwhile, prices for oil and other commodities have continued a breathtaking\nrise. The average retail gasoline price was about $1.10/gallon at the beginning of 2002\nand is now above $4 a gallon. Food prices also spiked in early 2007.\nWeighed down by these growing troubles, the economy slowed sharply starting in\nthe fourth quarter of last year. Indeed, in the first quarter of this year, the growth rate of\nconsumer spending slowed to its lowest pace since the 2001 recession, and business fixed\ninvestment stalled. On the consumer side, falling home and equity values have eroded\nhousehold wealth. Employment has fallen steadily since late last year, reducing\n\ndisposable income. In addition, surging food and gas prices mean that the income\npeople have gotten doesn’t go as far. So it’s not surprising that consumer sentiment has\nsoured on the economy. On the business side, the slowdown in demand, the elevated\nlevels of uncertainty,2 and tight financing conditions have continued to weigh on\ninvestment.\nIn the face of these adverse developments, the recent strength of spending data\nhas been somewhat reassuring. The pace of consumer spending, in particular, has been\nsurprisingly robust of late, fueled in part by tax rebates. The spending appeared to be\nbroad-based, with the not-so-surprising exception of motor vehicles, where sales have\nbeen very weak in recent months. On the business side, orders and shipments of\nnondefense capital goods excluding aircraft also look to have rebounded somewhat in\nrecent months. In addition, export growth has been a continuing bright spot. It has been\nbuoyed by continued strong growth abroad and by the weakening of the dollar. The\nstrong incoming data on spending ease my concerns somewhat about the intensity of the\nslowdown. However, a few months of data don’t make a trend, particularly because we\ncan’t be sure how large the effects of the roughly $100 billion temporary tax rebate\nprogram have been. About $50 billion of the rebates were sent out in May.\nInflation has become an increasing concern. Over the past twelve months, the\npersonal consumption expenditures—or PCE—price index rose 3.1 percent, up from 2.4\npercent over the prior year. An important reason for these disappointing numbers, of\ncourse, is the rise in commodity prices. Some of those increases may have also passed\nthrough to core PCE price inflation, which excludes food and energy. This measure has\n2 See Nick Bloom, “Will the credit crunch cause a recession?” CenterPiece, Spring 2008, pp. 20-23.\nhttp://www.stanford.edu/~nbloom/CreditCrunch.pdf.\n\naveraged 2.1 percent over the past twelve months, which is slightly above the range that I\nconsider consistent with price stability, but very close to its pace of increase over the last\nseveral years.\nLet me say a few words on how conditions in Oregon compare with the national\neconomy. After bouncing back in the wake of the 2001 recession, Oregon has seen\nrelatively strong economic growth compared with the rest of the country. Since 2002,\nreal economic growth in the state has averaged about 4.5 percent per year, well above the\nnational pace, and the unemployment rate has fallen from the highest in the nation during\nmuch of 2002-2003 to close to the national average more recently.\nLike much of the country, however, growth in Oregon slowed in 2007 and has\ncontinued to decelerate thus far in 2008. The manufacturing sector accounts for an\nunusually high share of economic activity in the state—nearly double the share\nnationwide—and several of the state’s manufacturing sectors have been struggling of\nlate. One particularly notable group is manufacturers of wood products, who have been\nforced to slash production and jobs as the housing boom turned to bust. Local makers of\nIT equipment also have reduced payrolls, as competition in this sector has stiffened.\nThese negatives have been offset by some important positives. Mirroring the key\nrole of the manufacturing sector, the share of exports in Oregon’s state economy is\nunusually large and highly oriented towards the fast-growing economies of East Asia.\nGiven the reduced exchange value of the dollar and strong growth conditions overseas,\nexports from the state have grown rapidly over the past few years. Moreover, while IT\nequipment makers have been struggling this year, the smaller IT software and services\nsector has been expanding rapidly, partly offsetting the losses on the hardware side. This\n\nview from Oregon highlights the point that, although the macroeconomic effects of the\nshocks hitting the economy are felt broadly, they are not felt evenly—either in Oregon or\nanywhere else.\nReturning to the national outlook, the key questions looking forward are: when\nwill economic activity get back to normal? And when will inflationary pressures\nmoderate? The answers to these questions depend, to a great extent, on how conditions\nin the housing, financial, and commodity markets evolve. Let me discuss each of them in\nturn, beginning with housing.\nHousing\nChanges in housing prices are inextricably linked to household wealth, which in\nturn affects consumer spending, as well as prospects for housing construction.\nUnfortunately, it appears to me that there are at least three reasons for thinking that\nhousing prices have further to fall. First, the ratio of house prices to rents—a kind of\nprice-dividend ratio for housing— still remains quite high by historical standards, despite\nhaving fallen from its historical peak reached in early 2006. That suggests that further\nprice declines may be needed to bring housing markets into balance. Second, inventories\nof unsold homes remain at elevated levels. This “excess supply” of available homes will\nput downward pressure on housing prices. Indeed, these inventories are likely to directly\ndepress construction activity, since there is little point in building new homes when there\nis already a large backlog of unsold homes. Third, the futures market for house prices\npredicts further declines in a number of metropolitan areas this year. In particular, the\nCase-Shiller composite index for home prices shows a 15 to 20 percent year-over-year\n\ndecline in the second half of this year. The bottom line is that construction spending and\nhouse prices seem likely to continue to fall well into 2009.\nCompared with most of the country and especially parts of the West, the Portland\nmetro area joined the housing party late and may end up with less of a hangover. The\npace of home price appreciation was slower in Portland than in the U.S. from 1998 until\n2005. Indeed, as things were beginning to cool nationally, the pace remained strong here\nin 2006 up to the latter half of 2007. Since then, prices appreciation has been flat or\ndown as much as 6 percent, depending on what index you look at.\nOne factor that helped sustain housing markets here is the state’s relatively\nlimited exposure to the sub-prime mortgage crisis. In 2006, the share of sub-primes in\nnew mortgages was about one-fifth in Portland and Oregon, versus one-third or more in\nsome of the hardest hit areas of California, Arizona, and Nevada. However, the pace of\nsales has fallen significantly, and mortgage delinquencies and home foreclosures have\nbeen rising since late 2006 in the state, although they have remained well below their\nlevels in the nation as a whole. Therefore, while Oregon is likely to emerge from the\nnational housing crisis in better shape than most of the country, there is still a ways to go.\nAnd, as with the rest of the country, it seems likely that further unpleasant adjustments in\nownership and equity will be necessary before the housing market stabilizes.\nFinancial Markets\nThe ongoing fall in house prices has important implications for the financial\nmarkets, and it is one reason that we may continue to get troubling news from that part of\nthe economy. As I mentioned, falling house prices and, in particular, their effects on the\nsubprime market, helped trigger the financial market crisis last August. At that time, the\n\nFed and other central banks took the first steps to pump substantial volumes of reserves\ninto the system to respond to the surge in demand for liquidity. These and other further\nactions helped alleviate some of the stress in financial markets. But earlier this year,\nrenewed stress culminated in the near failure of Bear Stearns in March. Again, the Fed\ntook actions to avert the peril that such a failure could have posed for financial markets\nand the real economy. Since then, market stress has subsided to some degree, and better\nquality borrowers are still able to get credit. For example, investment-grade corporate\nbond issuance has been very strong in recent months, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\nhave been able to issue substantial quantities of mortgage-backed securities.\nBut markets remain very fragile. For example, credit-default-swap spreads for\nmany financial institutions are again on the rise, the debt ratings for several important\nbond insurers have been cut, and stock prices for financial institutions have plummeted.\nThere is further evidence that financial markets are still not operating efficiently\nor effectively. In particular, the market for private-label securitized mortgages of even\nthe highest quality remains moribund. These securities were the primary source of\nfinancing for nonconforming residential mortgages, including subprime lending. Outside\nof the expanded FHA lending, there is little or no lending to higher-risk residential\nmortgage borrowers. Jumbo mortgages for prime borrowers are available, but at\nhistorically high spreads over rates on conventional mortgages, as banks have been\nreluctant to make these loans.\nUnfortunately, progress toward sturdier and more efficient financial markets is\ngoing to take some time, and that means the flow of credit is likely to remain impeded.\nLet me explain by using a plumbing metaphor. For one thing, it’s going to take time to\n\nclear the pipes of the problem debt. The gyrations in the prices of a number of securities\nsuggest that there are still hitches in the price discovery process. This may not be\nsurprising given that there is still a good deal of uncertainty about the valuation of\ncomplex, nontransparent financial instruments. There also is considerable uncertainty\nabout the extent of the ultimate losses and the exposure of different institutions. In the\ncase of residential mortgages, where delinquency rates are still rising, the single most\nimportant determinant of performance has been the pace of house price changes.3 But no\none is sure how much more house prices will fall, or how that will affect delinquency\nrates on mortgages. The considerable uncertainty has added to the difficulty of valuing\nthe underlying mortgages and related asset-backed securities. Credit quality problems\nalso are emerging outside residential mortgages. At commercial banks, for example,\ndelinquencies are now rising almost across the board. Especially notable is the rise in\ndelinquency rates on construction loans that is affecting even institutions that had steered\nclear of the subprime market.\nMoreover, it is not just a matter of clearing the pipes of the problem debt. The\nplumbing itself needs to be redesigned and rebuilt. Indeed, to deal with some of the\nvulnerabilities laid bare by the turmoil over the past year requires some restructuring in\nparts of the financial market and the channels for allocating credit. Key areas of change\ninclude the originate-to-distribute model and securitization used to finance higher-risk\nmortgage debt, financial risk management, re-intermediation and deleveraging more\ngenerally, and regulation and oversight of financial markets.\n3 FRBSF 2007 Annual Report (2008)\nhttp://www.frbsf.org/publications/federalreserve/annual/2007/subprime.pdf.\n\nLet me take these one at a time. First, securitization was a key driver of the credit\nexpansion. Financial institutions originated loans that they then bundled into securities\nand sold to other investors. With hindsight, it is clear that this originate-to-distribute\nmodel suffered severe incentive problems—the originator had insufficient incentive to\nensure the quality of the loans, since someone else ultimately held them. Conflicts of\ninterest and moral hazard problems also are nested in the many other linkages in the\nsecuritization process.4 Before private-label mortgage securitization can recover,\nfinancial markets must design mechanisms to align the incentives of originators with the\ninterests of the ultimate investors. Second, there was a widespread failure of risk\nmanagement, both in terms of liquidity and credit risk. An important shortcoming in\ncredit risk management was an excessive reliance on what turned out to be flawed\nassessments of risk by rating agencies of certain asset-backed securities. Investors, even\nlarge sophisticated financial institutions, did not take adequate steps to assess risk\nindependently. The lack of transparency in the credit process and the complexity of\nmany of the newer financial products did not help. Third, even with changes in\ncontracting and financial modeling, the re-intermediation process and deleveraging more\ngenerally is likely to continue. Re-intermediation involves a larger share of financing\nheld in the portfolios of institutions such as commercial banks and less by other investors\nholding securitized assets. The re-intermediation is part of deleveraging—that is less\nreliance on debt and more on equity financing—to the extent banks tend to hold more\ncapital than other less regulated financial institutions. We also will likely see less\n4 See, Adam B. Ashcraft and Til Schuermann (2008), “Understanding the Securitization of Subprime\nMortgage Credit.” Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Reports. no. 318, March 2008.\nhttp://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr318.pdf\n\nleverage in financing more generally. That is certainly evidenced by the greater shares of\nequity required in leveraged buyouts, as the pendulum is swinging back from the\nleveraged financing run amok that we saw even as late as the first part of 2007. While\nthese changes can improve the functioning of credit markets, they also likely will mean\nthat the cost of credit will be higher going forward. Finally, policymakers are likely to\nrevise the regulatory and supervisory environment in ways that will affect the structure,\nfunctioning, and oversight of financial markets, and that, too, will not be a speedy or\nsimple process.\nDuring the transition, financial institutions are struggling against forces that have\nexpanded their balance sheets even as they have sought to deleverage. Borrowers have\ntapped outstanding credit lines, institutions have booked leveraged loans that they\ncouldn’t sell, and banks have brought onto their books assets from off-balance-sheet\nfunding conduits. The potential for further pressures on capital, along with institutions’\nlower tolerance for risk and concern about economic conditions, has resulted in banks\ntightening credit conditions for virtually all borrowers. In recent weeks, large banks have\nbeen cutting back on lending.\nGoing forward, the ability and willingness of commercial banks and other\nintermediaries to extend credit depends in part on their capacity to expand equity capital\ninternally and externally. The encouraging news is that large commercial banks,\ninvestment banks, and mortgage specialists have, to some extent, been able to issue new\nequity capital and to rebuild capital positions that have come under pressure from a\ncombination of losses and growth in assets.\n\nThe balance-sheet pressures, and broader financial market dislocations, are likely\nto be with us for some time. My expectation is that market functioning will improve\nmarkedly by 2009. But things could get worse before they get better. For example,\nhome prices could fall more than markets expect, leading to larger losses for financial\ninstitutions and further impairing their ability to make new loans. The credit crunch\ncould then lead to further declines in house prices. The resulting decline in household\nwealth could then further reduce spending, leading to additional knock-on effects. So an\nadverse feedback loop could develop, with consequences for both financial markets and\neconomic activity.\nCommodities\nAs if housing and a credit crunch weren’t enough, prices for food and energy have\ngone through the roof. The spot price of West Texas intermediate crude oil has surged\nover 40 percent since January and over 100 percent in the last year, rising above $140 per\nbarrel in late June. Prices for other commodities, such as many metals and foods, have\nrisen sharply as well. Corn and wheat prices are up some 50 to 80 percent from a year\nago.\nThe debates about why commodity prices have surged are heard everywhere from\nthe nightly newscasts to the halls of Congress. While I don’t have a definitive answer\nmyself, I do think it makes sense to start by looking carefully at the supply and demand\nfundamentals, and, to my mind, they do appear to play a central role. On the demand\nside, booming economic activity in developing countries has boosted their appetite for\ncommodities. For example, since 2000, world demand for oil has increased by roughly\n11 million barrels per day, with China accounting for roughly 30 percent of this increase,\n\nand other developing countries accounting for another 60 percent. In addition, ethanol\nproduction accounts for a substantial amount of the increased demand for corn.\nOn the supply side, there have been constraints. Oil production has become more\nexpensive, major discoveries are increasingly difficult to find, and spare capacity to\nsupply more oil in the short run has been declining. As a result, energy supplies have not\nkept pace with growing worldwide demand. In some crop markets, bad weather has\nreduced supply. For example, drought conditions have hampered wheat production in\nAustralia, while excessive rainfall is affecting corn production here in the Midwest.\nNeither supply nor demand for commodities adjusts quickly, so large price\nchanges can occur in response to new information and other shocks to the market.\nRecent volatility in oil prices appears to reflect a combination of news related to\nintensifying geopolitical concerns, falling inventories, and further deterioration in\nestimates of long-term supply.\nThere has been much discussion about speculative trading in commodities\nmarkets and its possible influence on recent price movements. Hedge funds, institutional\ninvestors, and other traders have certainly increased their positions in commodity\nmarkets, typically by investing in commodity index funds, which consist of baskets of\ndifferent commodities that trade on exchanges. But I am not yet persuaded that\nspeculation, rather than the fundamentals of global supply and demand, has played an\nimportant role in driving up prices. For example, it should be harder to speculate and\ntake positions on commodities that are not easy to trade on futures markets and are not\nincluded in index funds. But the prices of individual commodities that are not in index\nfunds have risen just as fast as those that are.\n\nIn addition, if speculators were important in driving prices up, then, at the high\nprices now prevailing, demand by nonspeculative end users would fall short of current\nsupply, causing inventories to rise. In fact, however, inventories appear to have been\ndeclining in most commodity markets.\nThere is no dearth of stories about how rising prices for oil, food, and other\ncommodities are hitting U.S. consumers and businesses. In the case of oil, we all feel the\npain when we go to the gas pump. Businesses also buy gasoline and other products made\nfrom oil, so their costs go up as well. If rising commodity prices reflect supply and\ndemand fundamentals, then the situation is not likely to turn around any time soon, and\nthe consequence is that everyone is going to see that their dollar just doesn’t stretch as far\nanymore. In economists’ terms, “real wages”—that is, dollar wages expressed in terms\nof the goods and services they can buy—will rise more slowly or even fall. There is little\nthat monetary policy can do to prevent this.5\nThis is not a pleasant scenario, I grant you. Indeed, it raises the specter of the oil\nprice shocks of the 1970s, when over and above the inflation and real wage cuts due to\nsoaring energy costs, a more general inflation took hold, with wages and prices escalating\nthroughout the economy. The story of how it happened goes roughly like this.6\nWorkers—reasonably enough—asked for wage increases to pay the higher costs of food\nand energy. Their employers—mainly firms outside the energy sector--were in the same\ntough position as their employees: their costs were rising to the extent that they used oil\n5 At the margins, the Federal Reserve might have some effect on the relative price of oil to the extent that\nchanges in interest rates affect the exchange rate. But the real value of the dollar has depreciated only\nmodestly over the past year, while oil prices have doubled. For this reason, the price of a barrel of oil has\nrisen sharply, whether valued in terms of a depreciating currency, like the dollar, or in terms of an\nappreciating currency, like the euro.\n6 For one contemporaneous and more complete discussion of the inflation of the 1970s, see Alan Blinder,\nEconomic Policy and the Great Stagflation, Academic Press (1979).\n\nas an input in production; and the prices they were receiving for their products were, at\nleast initially, rising no faster than before. But in spite of the fact that firms outside the\nenergy sector were not well positioned to assent to faster wage increases, they granted\nthem anyhow, figuring—reasonably enough, it turned out—that they could pass those\ncosts on into higher prices for their goods. Why was this reasonable enough thinking by\nfirms? Because both they and their competitors were all in the same unpleasant straits,\nand they did not believe that the Fed was willing or able to keep a lid on overall prices.\nThe result was an upward wage-price spiral that led to double-digit inflation. That\ninflation ended only after a major recession that sent the unemployment rate over 10\npercent. So we have learned from hard experience that, as unpleasant as lower real wages\nare, they are an unavoidable consequence of a fundamentals-driven rise in commodity\nprices. But the development of a wage-price spiral, due to a loss of credibility in the\nFed’s determination to suppress it, may have even more devastating consequences.\nOutlook\nNow I’d like to pull all of these threads together to give you my outlook for the\neconomy. Activity has been weak since late last year, and, given the three shocks I’ve\ndiscussed, I expect the economy to grow only modestly for the remainder of the year, but\nto pick up next year. The earlier policy easing by the Federal Reserve will help cushion\nthe economy from some of the effects of the shocks, and the fiscal stimulus program is\nhelping at present. Over time, the drag from housing will wane and credit conditions\nshould improve.\nOn the inflation front, the predominant problem so far has been soaring food and\nenergy prices. Headline inflation is likely to remain much higher than I would like over\n\nthe next few quarters. My best guess, which could easily be wrong, is that, consistent\nwith futures prices, commodity prices will level off and cease to put direct upward\npressure on headline inflation. Core inflation has been better contained, but has still been\nrunning a bit higher than I would like. In the next few quarters, I wouldn’t be surprised if\nit runs modestly higher, as businesses pass some of their higher energy and transportation\ncosts on to customers. By early next year, however, I expect that, assuming commodity\nprices level off, core as well as headline inflation will moderate, as more slack in labor\nand product markets emerges. .\nPolicy\nLet me now turn to monetary policy. We’re approaching a crossroads. The\nFOMC responded to the difficult economic conditions that emerged last year by easing\nmonetary policy substantially. Between September and April, the Committee reduced the\nfederal funds rate by 3¼ percentage points to its current rate of 2 percent. With core\nconsumer inflation running at about the same rate, the real funds rate is now around zero.\nThese cuts in the target rate, along with the actions to foster greater liquidity in financial\nmarkets, have mitigated the worst effects of the squeeze on spending. I am somewhat\nreassured by the recent data, which suggest that my biggest fears on the downside have,\nso far, been avoided. Of course, the underlying housing, credit, and commodity-price\nissues are far from fully resolved. My discussion of those issues makes clear that a lot of\nuncertainty surrounds my outlook. A lot could still go wrong.\nBut maximum sustainable employment is only one of our mandates. The other is\nlow and stable inflation. In the wake of rapid increases in prices for gasoline and food,\nconsumer survey measures of longer term inflation expectations have turned up. In\n\ncontrast, other surveys, such as the Survey of Professional Forecasters, show little erosion\nin long-term inflation expectations. In addition, the anecdotes I hear are more consistent\nwith credibility than with an upward wage-price spiral. In particular, my contacts\nuniformly report that they see no signs of general wage pressures.\nOn balance, I still see inflation expectations as reasonably well anchored and I\nanticipate that consumer survey measures will come down once oil and food prices stop\nrising. But the risks to inflation are likely not symmetric and they have definitely\nincreased. We cannot and will not allow a wage-price spiral to develop.\nAs I began with a reference to Shakespeare, let me end with one as well: For\nmonetary policymakers, “readiness is all.” By this I mean that, in the face of these\ncompeting risks, we will monitor developments carefully and be prepared to act as\nneeded to fulfill our mandate for sustainable economic growth and price stability.",

    "text": "Speech to the Silicon Valley Chapter of Financial Executives International\nPalo Alto, CA\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery Tuesday, October 14, 2008, 7:00 PM Pacific time, 10:00 PM Eastern`\nThe Financial System and the Economy1\nGood evening. It’s a pleasure to have the chance to speak with you tonight, and\nI’m very grateful to your colleague and mine, Ken Wilcox, for inviting me to do so. I\nhave come to know him well during his tenure as a member of the Board of Directors of\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, and I thank him for his service. He and our\nother Directors not only provide oversight for the management of the Bank, but they also\ngive us valuable, real-time information on what is happening in their industries and their\nlocal economies.\nThis information is of crucial importance now, because it helps us assess the\nimpact of the financial market crisis on the borrowing, spending, and hiring decisions of\nhouseholds, firms, and state and local governments. It is because of such impacts that the\nturmoil in financial markets affects the prospects for growth and job creation in the\nmonths and years ahead. Financial crises are hardly unprecedented. In fact, over half of\nall International Monetary Fund member countries have experienced a systemic banking\ncrisis since 1980. But the financial crisis that began here in August 2007 has intensified\nin recent weeks, becoming exceptionally severe and global in its dimensions. Its\npotential ramifications for the economic well-being of citizens here and around the globe\nare a matter of grave concern. My goal tonight is to give you my perspective on both\n1\nI would like to thank the Economic Research staff for support in preparing these remarks, and in\nparticular, John Judd and Judith Goff.\n1\n\nfinancial and economic developments, and to discuss the array of policy responses to\nthem. As always, my comments represent my own views and do not necessarily reflect\nthose of any of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nTo preview my discussion, financial sector distress has led to a credit crunch in\nthe United States that is making it extremely difficult for financial institutions and many\ncorporations and households to borrow and spend. These developments have also shaken\nconfidence, causing households and firms to pull back, acting defensively and cautiously.\nSuch behavior weakens economic growth and employment. At the same time, the\nweakening economy is exacerbating the stress in financial markets. Such linkages\nbetween the “real” and financial sectors of the economy have created a feedback loop that\nis intensifying the economic downturn. Over the last year, Fed policymakers have acted\nto address both the escalating financial crisis and rising unemployment. But inflation has\nalso been an important concern, since it has been running at unacceptably high levels. In\nrecent months, however, the outlook for inflation has noticeably changed. Commodity\nprices, including the price of oil, have plunged. And I expect this development, along\nwith a further increase in slack in labor and product markets, to push inflation down to,\nand possibly even below, rates that I consider consistent with price stability.\nIn the view of many observers, the current financial crisis ranks as the worst since\nthe Great Depression. But I do not believe that the U.S. economy, in the years ahead,\nfaces a period of economic misery that will begin to rival the suffering associated with\nthat historic economic calamity. The American economy is more resilient now than then,\ndue in part to “automatic stabilizers” that were put in place to shield the incomes of\nhouseholds from fluctuations in the economy. More important, this is by no means a case\n2\n\nof having forgotten the past and being doomed to repeat it. Far from forgetting, much\nresearch has focused on that calamitous economic event, as well as on more recent\nbanking crises around the world. As a result, we have learned the importance of prompt\naction in a financial crisis. We also have learned what fundamental issues to address,\neven when the crisis has unique features, as this one does. Those fundamental issues are\nhow to implement appropriate macroeconomic policy and how to shore up the financial\nsector and thaw credit flows, thereby shielding the real economy from the worst potential\nspillovers from the turmoil. Last Friday, the G-7 finance ministers issued a statement\noutlining a comprehensive set of general principles to address the financial crisis. The\nstatement importantly recognized the need for international coordination to prevent\nbeggar-thy-neighbor financial and economic spillovers among countries of the type that\nworsened the Great Depression. It is heartening that such global coordination is indeed\ntaking place: the governments of the euro-area countries and the United Kingdom have\nannounced measures that translate these general principles into concrete policies. And\nthis morning, the Treasury, Federal Reserve, and FDIC announced a similar set of\ndetailed emergency actions. I will discuss these policies at the conclusion of my talk.\nEconomic developments and prospects\nI would first like to discuss the performance of the U.S. economy in some depth.\nThe recent flow of economic data suggests that the economy was weaker than expected in\nthe third quarter, probably showing essentially no growth at all. Growth in the fourth\nquarter appears to be weaker yet, with an outright contraction quite likely. Indeed, the\nU.S. economy appears to be in a recession. This is not a controversial view, since the\n3\n\nlatest Blue Chip consensus projects that there will be three consecutive quarters of\ncontraction in real GDP starting last quarter.\nBy now, virtually every major sector of the economy has been hit by the financial\nshock. I’ll start with consumer spending, where the news has not been good.\nEmployment has now declined for nine months in a row, and personal income, in\ninflation-adjusted terms, is virtually unchanged since April. Household wealth is\nsubstantially lower as house prices have continued to slide and the stock market has\ndeclined sharply. On top of this, consumer credit is costlier and harder to get: loan rates\nare up, loan terms are tougher, and increasing numbers of borrowers are being turned\naway entirely. Even before the extraordinary deterioration in financial market conditions\nover the past few weeks, the evidence was accumulating that consumer spending had\nweakened. In real terms, consumer spending was flat or contracted in recent months.\nVehicle sales in September plummeted, even with lower gas prices and continued\nincentives in place, a development that partially reflects the difficulties that people are\nhaving in obtaining auto loans.\nBusiness spending, too, is feeling the crunch, as firms face weak final demand for\ntheir products, a higher cost of capital, and restricted credit. In particular, many\ncompanies find that the financial markets have become unreceptive to their commercial\npaper, an important source of short-term funding. Some of our business contacts report\nthat bank lines of credit are more difficult to negotiate, and many indicate that they have\nbecome cautious in managing liquidity, in committing to capital spending projects that\ncan be deferred, and even in extending credit to customers and other counterparties.\n4\n\nSome companies are drawing down existing credit lines to have cash on hand in the event\nthat these lines are capped.\nWe’ve even begun to see some signs of a slowdown for the previously very strong\nIT industry across the country and in the Bay Area in particular. Several leading tech\ncompanies have announced plans for layoffs, and funding for start-ups has grown\nincreasingly tight. Among my own contacts, many expect spending to be largely flat or\ndown for the remainder of the year. A tech slowdown could intensify with the fall-off in\nconsumer spending, and the weakening in business spending could come into play since\nthe financial industry is a heavy user of both IT equipment and software. Despite these\ntroubling developments, the downturn in the local economy is likely to be far less severe\nthan the bust of the early 2000s, when the Bay Area was ground zero for the tech\nimplosion. This time, the downturn is centered elsewhere—in the real estate and finance\nsectors—so that the Bay Area economy is a victim of collateral damage rather than the\nprimary target.\nNonresidential construction is another sector that has been affected by the\nfinancial crisis, in part because the market for commercial mortgage-backed securities, a\nmainstay for financing large projects, has all but dried up. Banks and other traditional\nlenders have also become less willing to extend funding. With financing unavailable, I’m\nhearing talk about substantial cutbacks on new projects and planned capital\nimprovements on existing buildings.\nAlthough residential investment accounts for under 5 percent of overall economic\nactivity, the decline in housing construction over the past three years has created a major\ndrag on overall real GDP growth. Housing starts have plummeted. Yet inventories of\n5\n\nunsold new and existing homes remain at very high levels, making it difficult to predict\nwith any confidence when housing starts will bottom out. Indeed, the possibility of\nongoing contraction in this sector is intensified by the economic downturn, by the drop in\njobs, and by the high cost and tighter terms on mortgage credit. Understandably,\nfinancial institutions have made it more difficult to qualify for a mortgage by requiring\nmuch higher down payments, higher income-to-payment ratios, and higher FICO scores.\nMoreover, private-label securitized markets for residential mortgages are essentially\nclosed for business. The sole, but important, sources of mortgage securitization are the\ngovernment agencies, especially Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which provide backing\nmainly for conventional conforming mortgages. One piece of good news is that interest\nrates on conforming mortgages have come down a bit in recent weeks as a result of the\ntakeover of these entities by the federal government and the now explicit government\nbacking of both their debt and mortgage insurance guarantees.\nHouse prices have fallen along with construction. As I mentioned, the associated\nloss of wealth is a drag on consumer spending. Moreover, falling house prices are a\nmajor factor behind the delinquencies and foreclosures on subprime and other mortgages\nthat precipitated the current financial crisis. Unfortunately, the bottom for house prices is\nnot obviously in sight. For example, futures contracts for house prices predict further\ndeclines this year and next.\nMany state and local governments are being dragged deeper into the financial\nmess as well. The downturn in the economy has bitten into tax collections and made it\nharder to issue bonds. As you know, this has recently become a problem in California,\n6\n\nadding uncertainty to the state’s already difficult budget situation, which has been eroded\nby a revenue shortfall due to the economic slowdown.\nSo far, my comments should have made it clear that domestic spending has\nweakened substantially. Until recently, we have received a major boost from exporting\ngoods and services to our trading partners. Unfortunately, the news on foreign demand\nhas also turned weaker. Economic growth in the rest of the world, particularly in Europe\nand Japan, has slowed for a number of reasons, including spillovers from the U.S.\nslowdown, and most importantly, the financial meltdown that now has intensified\nsubstantially in Europe and elsewhere. In addition, the dollar has recently appreciated\nagainst the euro and British pound, offsetting a portion of the depreciation that was\nboosting U.S. exports. As a result, exports will not provide as much of an impetus to\ngrowth as they did earlier in the year.\nAs I noted at the outset, inflation has been a source of significant concern over the\npast year or so. However, economic developments in this country and abroad can be\nexpected to ease inflationary pressures. In the first place, prospects for weaker economic\nactivity around the world have led to a drop in food, energy, and other commodity prices,\nand this has relieved a good deal of the pressure on inflation from the earlier run-up in\ntheir prices. Secondly, slow growth here seems likely to boost both unemployment and\nunused industrial capacity. This additional slack in labor and product markets will put\ndownward pressure on inflation, moving it toward rates that I consider consistent with\nprice stability. In fact, some prominent forecasters at this stage are concerned that\ninflation in future years could decline to levels below what is consistent with price\nstability.\n7\n\nFinancial System\nI have highlighted a number of ways in which stresses in the financial sector are\nimpinging on economic activity through their effects on the spending decisions of\nconsumers, businesses, and governments. A precondition, in my view, for the economy\nto recover is that the financial system must get back on its feet. Last week, plunging stock\nmarkets in the U.S. and around the world received front page attention. But stocks were\nnot the only market that had a bad week. Indeed, the declines in stock prices were\nsymptomatic of deeper, fundamental problems. Term funding in the money markets\nbecame virtually unavailable to financial institutions: spreads on interbank term loans\nspiked. Financial firms found it necessary to fund themselves disproportionately\novernight. In addition, both financial and nonfinancial corporations had difficulty issuing\ncommercial paper as purchases by money market mutual funds declined. Borrowing\nrates have also risen dramatically for lower-grade bond issuers. This freezing up of credit\nflows reflects a breakdown of the trust and confidence needed for potential lenders to\nextend credit beyond overnight to counterparties and widespread flight to the very safest\nassets, to the point where Treasury bill yields have fallen to close to zero at various times\nin recent weeks. With near or outright failure afflicting firms like Lehman, Washington\nMutual, AIG, and Wachovia, investors have become exceptionally wary of a host of\nfinancial institutions, and aversion to counterparty risk is extremely high.\nI’d like to take a few moments to consider three key features of the financial\nsystem that interact with one another and lie behind this wariness about counterparty risk.\nEach of these features corresponds to one of the three main elements of a balance sheet:\nassets, capital, and liabilities. First, on the asset side, the wariness began with mounting\n8\n\ncredit losses on subprime mortgages, but the concern about credit losses has since spread\nto other kinds of loans. The banking system has dealt with large credit losses at times in\nthe past, but this episode has a novel element. Many of the new financial instruments\nused in mortgage finance, and in fact throughout the financial system, were considered\n“state of the art”—complex, capable of spreading risk, and constructed using\nsophisticated mathematical models to price the risk. As we have since discovered, the\npricing of the risk in these instruments has now become not a marvel of financial\nengineering, but a fog of confusion. Such complex instruments make it incredibly\ndifficult now to know where the risk actually resides or how to price it. In other words,\npeople need more information about these assets to be willing to participate in the\nmarkets for them, and they don’t have it. The problem is compounded by the uncertainty\nabout the value of the assets ultimately being financed, in particular, real estate.\nSecond is a shortage of capital—or, to put it another way, too much leverage\namong financial institutions as a whole. While conventional commercial banks were well\ncapitalized when the crisis started a year ago last summer, and they have raised a good\ndeal of capital over the last year, capital has still been negatively affected due to the\nwrite-down of many of the complex instruments I referred to and credit losses primarily\nassociated with delinquencies and foreclosures on real estate loans. However, the crisis\nextends beyond the banking sector to institutions in the so-called “shadow banking\nsector”; these include investment banks, as well as hedge funds, Structured Investment\nVehicles, or SIVs, and other conduits. During the years of the credit bubble, their\nstrategy involved becoming very highly leveraged; in many investment banks, for\n9\n\nexample, the ratio of assets to capital exceeded 30 to 1. Of course, high leverage means\nthat credit losses can very quickly turn into insolvency.\nThird, on the liability side, many financial institutions have relied heavily on\nshort-term debt to fund their operations, making them vulnerable to “runs.” Investment\nbanks, for example, commonly used very short-term—often overnight—repurchase\nagreements, and SIVs and conduits issued asset-backed commercial paper which was\ncommonly sold to money market mutual funds. No institution that borrows very short to\nhold a portfolio of longer-term, illiquid assets can satisfy the demands of its lenders for\nrepayment when they desire to flee en masse. It is for this reason that banks have been\nprotected with deposit insurance and access to the Federal Reserve’s discount window.\nIn the current crisis, however, this bank-like profile of borrowing short and lending long\nextends well beyond the commercial banking sector. Financial institutions are vulnerable\nnow to runs, because everyone knows that the system is exposed to impaired assets,\nbecause it is hard to determine exactly where those risks reside, and because some firms\nare known to have only slim equity cushions. We have seen in the last few weeks that\neven the fear that a firm may encounter future difficulties in rolling over debt can cause\nfunding to evaporate quickly.\nFinancial firms have been struggling mightily to fix their individual business\nproblems. They have tightened lending standards, trying to improve credit quality, and\nreduced the volume of loans. They have also been trying to sell assets. But attempts to\ndeleverage—to enhance balance sheet strength by selling assets—tend to further depress\nasset prices, producing additional losses and thereby creating selling pressures for other\nfirms holding similar positions. Write-downs on such securities are reducing the already\n10\n\ndiminished equity cushions in some firms and raising their leverage at a time when the\ngrowing risks in the financial markets make them and their counterparties desire less\nleverage, not more. This vicious cycle has led to outright illiquidity in markets for\ncertain asset-backed securities, making it almost impossible to determine appropriate\nprices and largely eliminating them as a source of new funding to borrowers. A final\nfactor compounding the credit crunch is that financial institutions, and even nonfinancial\nfirms, are hoarding liquidity, becoming very reluctant to lend to each other, except at the\nshortest maturities, since they are uncertain what demands they could face and whether\nthey will be able to borrow to meet them.\nWhile these responses make sense for individual institutions, they have led to a\ngreatly reduced flow of credit in the economy, which is the major factor responsible for\nthe economic downturn that now is under way. In other words, we are in the grip of an\n“adverse feedback loop” in which a credit crunch exacerbates economic weakness, which\nin turn weakens financial institutions, intensifying the credit crunch. Moreover, as I have\nexplained, the efforts of the private sector to fix itself through deleveraging and other\nmeans are only making matters worse. This is why government action was urgently\nneeded. I will now turn my attention to economic policies, beginning with those\nimplemented by the Federal Reserve.\nEconomic Policies\nThe Fed has potent tools to address the financial crisis and has used them\naggressively to shield the economy from its fallout. It also has demonstrated a\ncommitment to work with other central banks to coordinate policy. The policies\n11\n\navailable to the Fed fall into two categories—monetary policy and actions to improve\nliquidity in financial markets.\nLet me start with monetary policy. Since the onset of the financial crisis, the\nFOMC has cut its federal funds rate target by 375 basis points to its current level of 150\nbasis points. The most recent cut of 50 basis points took place last week, in an action\ncoordinated with the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, the Bank of Canada,\nthe Swiss National Bank, and the Swedish National Bank. I strongly supported this\naction. Recent financial developments and economic data make it clear that the outlook\nfor the U.S. economy has weakened noticeably, and inflationary pressures have\nsubstantially abated. Coordinated action symbolizes the determination of central banks to\nact together to address what is now a global crisis. And it diminishes the potential\nexchange rate repercussions of any single country’s solo action.\nRate cuts are by no means a panacea, but they do at least partially offset the\ntightening of financial conditions due to higher spreads, reflecting heightened credit and\nliquidity risk and a marked increase in general risk aversion. Most private-sector\nborrowing rates are higher now than at the beginning of this crisis in August 2007 in spite\nof these substantial cuts. In pointing this out, I don’t mean to imply that the rate cuts did\nno good: borrowing rates in my view would be substantially higher absent the reduction\nin our base lending rate.\nNext let me turn to the Fed’s direct actions to improve liquidity in financial\nmarkets. Since the onset of the crisis, the Fed has ramped up its use of an arsenal of\nliquidity tools, devising new facilities to lend directly to banks and other borrowers that\nhave been frozen out of the credit markets. These facilities reduce the chance of runs on\n12\n\nfinancial institutions by providing the assurance of short-term funding from the Fed based\non an expanded range of collateral. For example, the Term Auction Facility (TAF)\nprovides loans to meet the liquidity needs of depository institutions. Other facilities—\nparticularly the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) and Term Securities Lending\nFacility (TSLF)—address the funding difficulties facing primary dealers. The Fed\nrecently implemented a facility to provide liquidity support to money market mutual\nfunds. This complements the Treasury’s initiative to provide insurance against loss to\ninvestors in money market mutual funds. Last week, the Fed announced a plan to\npurchase high-grade commercial paper from both financial and nonfinancial corporations\nin response to the freezing up of commercial paper markets. In addition, the Fed has\ncooperated with foreign central banks by providing dollar funding to foreign financial\ninstitutions through swap arrangements and has announced its willingness to adjust the\nsize of its swap lines with several central banks to accommodate whatever quantity of\nU.S. dollar funding is demanded. Beyond these facilities, the Fed has provided direct\nfinancing to prevent the outright bankruptcy of two institutions—Bear Stearns and\nAIG—whose failure, in the judgment of the Fed and the Treasury, would have\nsignificantly undermined financial stability.\nLast week, the Fed took advantage of authority just granted to it under the\nEmergency Economic Stabilization Act passed by Congress to pay interest on the\nreserves held by banks in their accounts at the Fed. This new tool is important because it\nenables the Fed to expand its liquidity facilities by any magnitude that may ultimately be\ndeemed necessary to provide direct credit to institutions and sectors that are frozen out of\nthe credit markets. Without this new tool, increases in the overall scale of the Fed’s\n13\n\nbalance sheet resulting from expanded liquidity operations would have pushed the funds\nrate below the FOMC’s target level, compromising its monetary policy objective.\nEven though the Fed has deployed an arsenal of weapons to attack the financial\ncrisis, more was obviously needed. A comprehensive solution requires actions that are\n“fiscal” in the sense that they use taxpayer funds or place them at risk, and thus extend\nbeyond the Fed’s legislative mandate. The actions that have now been announced or\nimplemented fall into three main categories, corresponding to the three underlying\nproblems in the financial system that I identified earlier: short-term funding, impaired\nassets, and capital shortage.\nWith respect to short-term funding, in addition to the Fed initiatives I described,\ndirect government guarantees against default have now been extended on an emergency\nbasis to boost public confidence in lending to financial institutions. The Treasury has\nimplemented an insurance program for deposits in money market mutual funds; Congress\ntemporarily raised FDIC deposit insurance from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor.\nAnd this morning, the FDIC announced an important program to temporarily guarantee\nthe senior debt of all FDIC-insured institutions and their holding companies, and all\ndeposits in non-interest bearing transaction accounts. Along the same lines, the G-7\npledged in their action plan to “use all available tools to support systemically important\nfinancial institutions and prevent their failure.” Guarantees that address counterparty risk\nhead-on are obviously confidence boosting. There is a danger, however, that funds could\nshift in ways that would harm stability if the guarantees apply in some countries or\nfinancial sectors but not others. In light of this concern, it is constructive that the U.S.\nactions mirrored policies announced by other countries. Last week, the United Kingdom\n14\n\npledged to guarantee bank debt, an initiative intended to jumpstart the near-frozen\ninterbank market, and a similar step is included in the plan adopted Sunday by the\ngovernments of the euro-area countries.\nWith respect to impaired assets, experience reveals that programs to remove\nnonperforming loans from the balance sheets of financial institutions have proven helpful\nin resolving a number of earlier financial crises in both industrial and developing\ncountries. Under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, the Treasury is formulating\nplans to purchase mortgage-related assets. Such purchases could reduce uncertainty\nabout the valuation of financial institutions, which is a barrier to raising private capital.\nThey may also succeed in restoring some liquidity in the secondary markets where there\nis now little trading activity. To the extent that the prices that the government pays\nthrough auctions exceed the fire-sale prices now used to value them, some institutions\nwill see an improvement in their capital.\nThe third problem afflicting the financial sector—capital shortage--is critical. It is\ntherefore extremely heartening that the governments of all countries involved in the crisis\nhave announced immediate plans to inject capital into their financial systems. Among\neconomists, there is a remarkable consensus on the importance of recapitalizing the\nfinancial sector. Moreover, it emerges as the clearest lesson learned from the global\nfinancial crises of recent decades. Adequate capital is a sine qua non for a sound\nfinancial institution and thus a prerequisite for the restoration of confidence in the\nfinancial system. Financial sector capital must also be augmented for the sector to be\ncapable of meeting the economy’s credit needs. To accomplish this key objective, the\nTreasury this morning announced a voluntary plan to make $250 billion in capital\n15\n\navailable to a wide array of U.S. banks and thrifts in the form of preferred stock. The\nauthority for this equity purchase program was granted by Congress in the Emergency\nEconomic Stabilization Act. The program has been designed to encourage financial\ninstitutions to raise additional capital in the private sector. This is a critical step toward\nfinancial stability.\nLet me conclude by saying that the turmoil in global financial markets poses a\nserious and direct threat to the well-being of all citizens of the global economy. Although\nthe challenges are daunting, I am encouraged that policymakers around the globe are now\nresponding rapidly and forcefully to resolve the financial crisis. The global economic\noutlook depends on how well these policies succeed.\n# # #\n16",

This guidance outlines high-level\nprinciples related to safe–and–sound leveraged lending activities. This guidance applies to all financial\ninstitutions supervised by the Federal Reserve that engage in leveraged lending activities.2\nOverview of Guidance\nThe 2013 leveraged lending guidance updates and replaces the 2001 Interagency Guidance on\nLeveraged Financing (2001 guidance).3 Further, the 2013 leveraged lending guidance is intended to be\nconsistent with sound industry practices and to expand on recent interagency guidance on stress-testing.4\n1 The number of community banks with substantial involvement in leveraged lending is small; therefore,\nthe Federal Reserve generally expects community banking organizations to be largely unaffected by this\nguidance.\n2 This includes bank holding companies, savings and loan holding companies, state member banks, and\nstate-chartered branches and agencies of foreign banks.\n3 With the issuance of the 2013 leveraged lending guidance, SR letter 01-9, “Interagency Guidance on\nLeveraged Financing,” is superseded.\n4 Refer to http://www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/srletters/sr1207.htm, “Supervisory Guidance on\nStress Testing for Banking Organizations with More Than $10 Billion in Total Consolidated Assets.”\n\nIn summary, the 2013 leveraged lending guidance addresses:\n• Definition of leveraged lending. The guidance encourages companies to develop and maintain a\ndefinition of leveraged lending that can be applied across all business lines. The guidance also includes\nexamples of loan terms common in leveraged lending definitions.\n• Participations Purchased. The guidance notes that institutions of all sizes can have exposure to\nleveraged loans by acting as participants. In particular, an institution that acquires a loan participation\nshould apply the same standards of prudence, credit assessment techniques, and in-house limits that\nwould apply if the institution originated the loan. In addition, the guidance provides that loan participants\nshould obtain copies of all loan documents and any other documents relevant to the credit.\n• Methods for determining enterprise value. The guidance notes that lenders often rely upon\nenterprise value when (1) evaluating the feasibility of a loan request, (2) determining the debt reduction\npotential of planned asset sales, (3) assessing a borrower’s ability to access the capital markets, and (4)\nestimating the strength of a secondary source of repayment. The guidance describes three common\napproaches (that is, asset, income, and market) for valuing closely-held businesses under conventional\nbusiness appraisal theory and discusses the circumstances in which each approach is most appropriate.\n• Pipeline management. Market disruptions can substantially impede the ability of a loan underwriter to\nconsummate syndications or otherwise sell down exposures, which may result in material losses to the\nunderwriter. Accordingly, the guidance indicates that institutions should (1) have strong risk management\nand controls over transactions in the distribution pipeline, including amounts to be held and those to be\ndistributed, and (2) be able to differentiate transactions according to their tenor and investor class.\n• Underwriting. An institution’s underwriting standards should be clear, written, and measurable,\nreflecting the institution’s risk appetite. Accordingly, the guidance contains underwriting and risk\nmanagement standards for leveraged loans and encourages originating institutions to be mindful of the\nreputational risk associated with poorly underwritten leveraged transactions.\n• Stress Testing. Institutions should conduct periodic loan- and portfolio-level stress tests on leveraged\nloan portfolios, including loans planned for distribution, and incorporate the results into enterprise-wide\nstress testing activities.\n• Risk management and reporting. Institutions should diligently monitor higher-risk credits, including\nleveraged loans. Accordingly, the guidance indicates that management should receive comprehensive\nreports about the characteristics and trends of the institution’s leveraged lending portfolio at least\nquarterly and that the institution’s board of directors should receive a summary of this information.\nInternal policies should identify the data fields to be captured by an institution’s management information\nsystems, which should yield accurate and timely reporting to management and the board of directors.\n\nAdditional Information\nAll circulars and documents are available on the Internet through the Federal Reserve Bank of San\nFrancisco’s website, at http://www.frbsf.org/banking/letters.\nFor additional information, please contact:\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nBanking Supervision and Regulation\n(213) 364-1026\nAttachment:\nInteragency Guidance on Leveraged Lending\nCross References:\nSR 12-7 Supervisory Guidance on Stress Testing for Banking Organizations with More Than $10 Billion\nin Total Consolidated Assets\nSR 98-25 Sound Credit Risk Management and the Use of Internal Credit Risk Ratings at Large Banking\nOrganizations",

    "text": "For release at\n8:00 a.m. EST\nNovember 17, 2016\nStatement by\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nbefore the\nJoint Economic Committee\nU.S. Congress\nNovember 17, 2016\n\nChairman Coats, Ranking Member Maloney, and members of the Committee, I\nappreciate the opportunity to testify before you today. I will discuss the current economic\noutlook and monetary policy.\nThe Economic Outlook\nThe U.S. economy has made further progress this year toward the Federal Reserve’s\ndual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability. Job gains averaged\n180,000 per month from January through October, a somewhat slower pace than last year but\nstill well above estimates of the pace necessary to absorb new entrants to the labor force. The\nunemployment rate, which stood at 4.9 percent in October, has held relatively steady since the\nbeginning of the year. The stability of the unemployment rate, combined with above-trend job\ngrowth, suggests that the U.S. economy has had a bit more “room to run” than anticipated earlier.\nThis favorable outcome has been reflected in the labor force participation rate, which has been\nabout unchanged this year, on net, despite an underlying downward trend stemming from the\naging of the U.S. population. While above-trend growth of the labor force and employment\ncannot continue indefinitely, there nonetheless appears to be scope for some further\nimprovement in the labor market. The unemployment rate is still a little above the median of\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants’ estimates of its longer-run level, and\ninvoluntary part-time employment remains elevated relative to historical norms. Further\nemployment gains may well help support labor force participation as well as wage gains; indeed,\nthere are some signs that the pace of wage growth has stepped up recently. While the\nimprovements in the labor market over the past year have been widespread across racial and\nethnic groups, it is troubling that unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanics\nremain higher than for the nation overall, and that the annual income of the median African\n\n- 2 -\nAmerican household and the median Hispanic household is still well below the median income\nof other U.S. households.\nMeanwhile, U.S. economic growth appears to have picked up from its subdued pace\nearlier this year. After rising at an annual rate of just 1 percent in the first half of this year,\ninflation-adjusted gross domestic product is estimated to have increased nearly 3 percent in the\nthird quarter. In part, the pickup reflected some rebuilding of inventories and a surge in soybean\nexports. In addition, consumer spending has continued to post moderate gains, supported by\nsolid growth in real disposable income, upbeat consumer confidence, low borrowing rates, and\nthe ongoing effects of earlier increases in household wealth. By contrast, business investment\nhas remained relatively soft, in part because of the drag on outlays for drilling and mining\nstructures that has resulted from earlier declines in oil prices. Manufacturing output continues to\nbe restrained by the weakness in economic growth abroad and by the appreciation in the U.S.\ndollar over the past two years. And while new housing construction has been subdued in recent\nquarters despite rising prices, the underlying fundamentals--including a lean stock of homes for\nsale, an improving labor market, and the low level of mortgage rates--are favorable for a pickup.\nTurning to inflation, overall consumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal\nconsumption expenditures, increased 1-1/4 percent over the 12 months ending in September, a\nsomewhat higher pace than earlier this year but still below the FOMC’s 2 percent objective.\nMuch of this shortfall continues to reflect earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-\nenergy imports. Core inflation, which excludes the more volatile energy and food prices and\ntends to be a better indicator of future overall inflation, has been running closer to 1-3/4 percent.\nWith regard to the outlook, I expect economic growth to continue at a moderate pace\nsufficient to generate some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a return of\n\n- 3 -\ninflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the next couple of years. This judgment\nreflects my view that monetary policy remains moderately accommodative and that ongoing job\ngains, along with low oil prices, should continue to support household purchasing power and\ntherefore consumer spending. In addition, global economic growth should firm, supported by\naccommodative monetary policies abroad. As the labor market strengthens further and the\ntransitory influences holding down inflation fade, I expect inflation to rise to 2 percent.\nMonetary Policy\nI will turn now to the implications of recent economic developments and the economic\noutlook for monetary policy. The stance of monetary policy has supported improvement in the\nlabor market this year, along with a return of inflation toward the FOMC’s 2 percent objective.\nIn September, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at\n1/4 to 1/2 percent and stated that, while the case for an increase in the target range had\nstrengthened, it would, for the time being, wait for further evidence of continued progress toward\nits objectives.\nAt our meeting earlier this month, the Committee judged that the case for an increase in\nthe target range had continued to strengthen and that such an increase could well become\nappropriate relatively soon if incoming data provide some further evidence of continued progress\ntoward the Committee’s objectives. This judgment recognized that progress in the labor market\nhas continued and that economic activity has picked up from the modest pace seen in the first\nhalf of this year. And inflation, while still below the Committee’s 2 percent objective, has\nincreased somewhat since earlier this year. Furthermore, the Committee judged that near-term\nrisks to the outlook were roughly balanced.\n\n- 4 -\nWaiting for further evidence does not reflect a lack of confidence in the economy.\nRather, with the unemployment rate remaining steady this year despite above-trend job gains,\nand with inflation continuing to run below its target, the Committee judged that there was\nsomewhat more room for the labor market to improve on a sustainable basis than the Committee\nhad anticipated at the beginning of the year. Nonetheless, the Committee must remain forward\nlooking in setting monetary policy. Were the FOMC to delay increases in the federal funds rate\nfor too long, it could end up having to tighten policy relatively abruptly to keep the economy\nfrom significantly overshooting both of the Committee’s longer-run policy goals. Moreover,\nholding the federal funds rate at its current level for too long could also encourage excessive\nrisk-taking and ultimately undermine financial stability.\nThe FOMC continues to expect that the evolution of the economy will warrant only\ngradual increases in the federal funds rate over time to achieve and maintain maximum\nemployment and price stability. This assessment is based on the view that the neutral federal\nfunds rate--meaning the rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary and keeps the\neconomy operating on an even keel--appears to be currently quite low by historical standards.\nConsistent with this view, growth in aggregate spending has been moderate in recent years\ndespite support from the low level of the federal funds rate and the Federal Reserve’s large\nholdings of longer-term securities. With the federal funds rate currently only somewhat below\nestimates of the neutral rate, the stance of monetary policy is likely moderately accommodative,\nwhich is appropriate to foster further progress toward the FOMC’s objectives. But because\nmonetary policy is only moderately accommodative, the risk of falling behind the curve in the\nnear future appears limited, and gradual increases in the federal funds rate will likely be\nsufficient to get to a neutral policy stance over the next few years.\n\n- 5 -\nOf course, the economic outlook is inherently uncertain, and, as always, the appropriate\npath for the federal funds rate will change in response to changes to the outlook and associated\nrisks.\nThank you. I would be pleased to answer your questions.",

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nG-30 International Banking Seminar\nWashington, D.C.\nOctober 15, 2017\n\nI would like to thank the Group of Thirty for inviting me to participate in their\nInternational Banking Seminar and also thank Luis Alberto Moreno of the Inter-\nAmerican Development Bank for hosting this event. My comments today will focus on\nU.S. economic prospects and monetary policy.\nEconomic activity in the United States has been growing moderately so far this\nyear, and the labor market has continued to strengthen. The terrible hurricanes that hit\nTexas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and our neighbors in the Caribbean caused tremendous\ndamage and upended many lives, and our hearts go out to those affected. While the\neffects of the hurricanes on the U.S. economy are quite noticeable in the short term,\nhistory suggests that the longer-term effects will be modest and that aggregate economic\nactivity will recover quickly.\nStarting with the labor market, through August, payroll job gains averaged\n170,000 per month this year, down only a little from the average pace of gains in 2016\nand still well above estimates of the pace necessary to absorb new entrants to the labor\nforce. In September, payrolls were reported to have declined 33,000, but that weakness\nreflected the effects of Hurricane Irma, which hit Florida during the reference week for\nthe September labor market surveys. I would expect employment to bounce back in\nsubsequent months as communities recover and people return to their jobs. Other aspects\nof the jobs report for September were strong. The unemployment rate, which seems not\nto have been noticeably affected by the hurricanes, declined further to 4.2 percent, down\nabout 1/2 percentage point from the end of 2016 and below the median of Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC) participants’ estimates of its longer-run normal level. Labor\nforce participation continues to strengthen relative to a downward trend that reflects, in\n\n- 2 -\npart, the aging of the population. Other labor market indicators, including the rates of job\nopenings and the number of people who voluntarily quit their jobs, also point to strength.\nWage indicators have been mixed, and the most recent news, on average hourly\nearnings through September, was encouraging. On balance, wage gains appear moderate,\nand the pace seems broadly consistent with a tightening labor market once we account for\nthe disappointing productivity growth in recent years.\nI expect the labor market to strengthen further as economic growth continues.\nThe hurricanes will likely result in some hit to GDP growth in the third quarter but a\nrebound thereafter, and smoothing through those movements, I’m expecting growth that\ncontinues to exceed potential in the second half of the year. The latest projections from\nFOMC participants have a median of 2-1/2 percent GDP growth this year. Growth of\nconsumer spending has been supported by the ongoing job gains and relatively high\nlevels of household wealth and consumer sentiment. Business investment has\nstrengthened this year following surprising weakness in 2016. The faster gains partly\nreflect an upturn in investment in the energy sector as oil prices have firmed. But the\ngains have been broader than that, and some measures of business sentiment remain quite\nstrong. Exports also have risen this year, as growth abroad has solidified and the\nexchange value of the dollar has declined somewhat. My fellow FOMC participants and\nI perceive that risks to global growth have receded somewhat and expect growth to\ncontinue to improve over the near term.\nThe biggest surprise in the U.S. economy this year has been inflation. Earlier this\nyear, the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures\n(PCE) reached 2 percent, and core PCE inflation reached 1.9 percent. These readings\n\n- 3 -\nseemed consistent with the view that inflation had been held down by both the sizable fall\nin oil prices and the appreciation of the dollar starting around mid-2014, and that these\ninfluences have diminished significantly by this year. Accordingly, inflation seemed well\non its way to the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation objective on a sustainable basis.\nInflation readings over the past several months have been surprisingly soft,\nhowever, and the 12-month change in core PCE prices has fallen to 1.3 percent. The\nrecent softness seems to have been exaggerated by what look like one-off reductions in\nsome categories of prices, especially a large decline in quality-adjusted prices for\nwireless telephone services. More generally, it is common to see movements in inflation\nof a few tenths of a percentage point that are hard to explain, and such “surprises” should\nnot really be surprising. My best guess is that these soft readings will not persist, and\nwith the ongoing strengthening of labor markets, I expect inflation to move higher next\nyear. Most of my colleagues on the FOMC agree. In the latest Summary of Economic\nProjections, my colleagues and I project inflation to move higher next year and to reach 2\npercent by 2019.\nTo be sure, our understanding of the forces that drive inflation is imperfect, and\nwe recognize that this year’s low inflation could reflect something more persistent than is\nreflected in our baseline projections. The fact that a number of other advanced\neconomies are also experiencing persistently low inflation understandably adds to the\nsense among many analysts that something more structural may be going on. Let me\nmention a few possibilities of more fundamental influences.1\n1 For further discussion, see Janet Yellen (2017), “Inflation, Uncertainty, and Monetary Policy,” speech\ndelivered at “Prospects for Growth: Reassessing the Fundamentals,” the 59th annual meeting of the\nNational Association for Business Economics, Cleveland, Ohio, September 26,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20170926a.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nFirst, given that estimates of the natural rate of unemployment are so uncertain, it\nis possible that there is more slack in U.S. labor markets than is commonly recognized,\nwhich may be true for some other advanced economies as well. If so, some further\ntightening in the labor market might be needed to lift inflation back to 2 percent.\nSecond, some measures of longer-term inflation expectations have edged lower\nover the past few years in several major economies, and it remains an open question\nwhether these measures might be reflecting a true decline in expectations that is broad\nenough to be affecting actual inflation outcomes.\nThird, our framework for understanding inflation dynamics could be misspecified\nin some way. For example, global developments--perhaps technological in nature, such\nas the tremendous growth of online shopping--could be helping to hold down inflation in\na persistent way in many countries. Or there could be sector-specific developments--such\nas the subdued rise in medical prices in the United States in recent years--that are not\ntypically included in aggregate inflation equations but which have contributed to lower\ninflation. Such global and sectoral developments could continue to be important\nrestraining influences on inflation. Of course, there are also risks that could unexpectedly\nboost inflation more rapidly than expected, such as resource utilization having a stronger\ninfluence when the economy is running closer to full capacity.\nIn this economic environment, with ongoing improvements in labor market\nconditions and softness in inflation that is expected to be temporary, the FOMC has\ncontinued its policy of gradual policy normalization. As the Committee announced after\nour September meeting, we are initiating our balance sheet normalization program this\nmonth. That program, which was described in the June Addendum to the Policy\n\n- 5 -\nNormalization Principles and Plans, will gradually scale back our reinvestments of\nproceeds from maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from agency\nsecurities. As a result, our balance sheet will decline gradually and predictably.2 By\nlimiting the volume of securities that private investors will have to absorb as we reduce\nour holdings, the caps should guard against outsized moves in interest rates and other\npotential market strains.\nChanging the target range for the federal funds rate is our primary means of\nadjusting the stance of monetary policy. Our balance sheet is not intended to be an active\ntool for monetary policy in normal times. We therefore do not plan on making\nadjustments to our balance sheet normalization program. But, of course, as we stated in\nJune, the Committee would be prepared to resume reinvestments if a material\ndeterioration in the economic outlook were to warrant a sizable reduction in the federal\nfunds rate.\nAlso at our September meeting, the Committee decided to maintain its target for\nthe federal funds rate. We continue to expect that the ongoing strength of the economy\nwill warrant gradual increases in that rate to sustain a healthy labor market and stabilize\ninflation around our 2 percent longer-run objective. That expectation is based on our\nview that the federal funds rate remains somewhat below its neutral level--that is, the\nlevel that is neither expansionary nor contractionary and keeps the economy operating on\nan even keel. The neutral rate currently appears to be quite low by historical standards,\n2 For October through December of this year, the decline in the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings will\nbe capped at $6 billion per month for Treasury securities and $4 billion per month for agency securities.\nThese caps will gradually rise over the course of the following year to maximums of $30 billion per month\nfor Treasury securities and $20 billion per month for agency securities and will remain in place through the\nprocess of normalizing the size of our balance sheet.\n\n- 6 -\nimplying that the federal funds rate would not have to rise much further to get to a neutral\npolicy stance. But we expect the neutral level of the federal funds rate to rise somewhat\nover time, and, as a result, additional gradual rate hikes are likely to be appropriate over\nthe next few years to sustain the economic expansion. Indeed, FOMC participants have\nbuilt such a gradual path of rate hikes into their projections for the next couple of years.\nOf course, policy is not on a preset course. I have spoken about some of the\nuncertainties associated with the inflation outlook in particular, and we will be paying\nclose attention to the inflation data in the months ahead. But uncertainty about the\noutlook is by no means limited to inflation. As always, the Committee will adjust the\nstance of monetary policy in response to incoming economic information and the\nevolution of the economic outlook to achieve its objectives of maximum employment and\nstable prices. Moreover, we are mindful of the possibility that shifting expectations\nconcerning the path of U.S. policy can lead to spillovers to other economies via financial\nmarkets and the value of the dollar. We remain committed to communicating as clearly\nand effectively as possible to help mitigate the risk of sudden changes in the policy\noutlook among market participants that could spur unintended effects in global financial\nmarkets.",

    "text": "Panel on: “Behavioral Economics and Economic Policy in the Past and Future”\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston Conference: “Implications of Behavioral Economics for\nEconomic Policy”\nBoston, Massachusetts\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery September 28, 2007, 10:15 AM Eastern\nImplications of Behavioral Economics for Monetary Policy1\nI want to congratulate the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston for organizing a fascinating\nand thought-provoking conference. I applaud the Bank’s decision to establish a center to promote\nand support research in behavioral economics and concur wholeheartedly with the judgment that\nmotivates these initiatives—that research in behavioral economics is broadening and enriching\nour understanding of decisionmaking. This research has the potential to strengthen the\nconceptual and empirical underpinnings of macroeconomic policy.\nThe Federal Reserve is one of a growing number of organizations that have already taken\nsome implications of behavioral research to heart. This year, we began to automatically enroll\nnew employees into our System’s savings plan, defaulting them into an asset allocation fund that\nincludes fixed income, domestic, and international equity investments. Employees who do not\nwant to participate can, of course, easily opt out. But our early experience mirrors well-known\nresearch findings: so far, an overwhelming fraction of employees who were defaulted in remain\nin. Of course, this choice reflects the Federal Reserve System’s appreciation of the striking\nfindings of behavioral economics concerning the sensitivity of saving decisions to default\nenrollments.\n1 I am deeply indebted to staff in the Economic Research Department of the Federal Reserve Bank of San\nFrancisco, and most particularly to John Fernald, for their help in preparing these remarks.\n1\n\nIn terms of the Federal Reserve’s public policy responsibilities, I can easily envision\nother ways in which explorations in behavioral economics could be of practical use. For\nexample, one of the Federal Reserve’s responsibilities is to design consumer disclosures,\nincluding the information that borrowers receive from lenders when they take out a mortgage,\napply for a credit card, or lease a new vehicle. As we have unfortunately seen recently, such\ndisclosures have not always been effective in conveying the key information that is relevant to\nsuch decisions in a salient, understandable, and timely way. Indeed, recent research by the\nFederal Trade Commission2 documents that a large fraction of mortgage borrowers fail to\nunderstand the financial implications of prepayment penalties and other complex loan features.\nTo improve the effectiveness of such disclosures, the Federal Reserve has begun to use consumer\ntesting techniques,3 but there remains substantial scope for behavioral research to contribute to\nthe design of more effective practices in the consumer disclosure area.\nToday, however, I would like to focus on some implications of behavioral economics for\nthe conduct of monetary policy. I will concentrate on implications of behavioral research for the\nPhillips curve, although the papers at this conference demonstrate that behavioral economics has\nimplications for many other aspects of macroeconomic modeling, including the behavior of\nhousing and other asset prices, and the specification of crucial components of aggregate demand,\nsuch as the consumption function.\nThe Phillips curve is a core component of every realistic macroeconomic model. It plays\na critical role in policy determination, because its characteristics importantly influence the short-\nand long-run tradeoffs that central banks face as they strive to achieve price stability and, in the\nFederal Reserve’s case, maximum sustainable employment—our second, congressionally\n2 See Lacko and Pappalardo (2007).\n3 See Kroszner (2007).\n2\n\nmandated goal. I will argue that behavioral economics can enhance our understanding of the\nPhillips curve, and this is important for two reasons: First, better models of the inflation process\nhelp improve our forecasts and clarify limitations on what monetary policy can do. Second, the\ntheoretical underpinnings of the Phillips curve are important in understanding what central banks\nshould do. In other words, beyond determining the “constraints” governing what is feasible,\nmodels underpinning the Phillips curve have implications for the way in which central banks\nshould interpret their price stability mandate and for assessing the welfare costs of fluctuations in\noutput and inflation.\nThe New Keynesian model provides theoretical microfoundations for a Phillips curve\nthat relates actual inflation to expected inflation one period ahead as well as to marginal cost. 4\nThis model has become a standard workhorse for policy analysis, and provides loose justification\nfor empirical implementations of the Phillips curve, which typically relate actual inflation to lags\nof inflation (as a proxy for expected inflation), a measure of the output or unemployment gap\n(which proxies for cyclical fluctuations in marginal cost), and other variables reflecting “supply\nshocks” such as the prices of energy and imported goods. The coefficient on the unemployment\ngap in the Phillips curve determines the slope of the “short-run” Phillips curve relationship\nbetween unemployment and inflation and is a crucial parameter for monetary policy because it\ninfluences the sacrifice ratio--the cost in terms of unemployment or lost output to lower inflation.\nVirtually all empirical research on the inflationary process finds that the “short-run” Phillips\ncurve is flat enough to generate a significant short-run tradeoff.\n4 The New Keynesian intuition for such a relationship is that firms that are readjusting their prices today\nwill want higher prices if the marginal cost of production is relatively high; but they are also concerned that they\nmight be unable to change their price in the future. Hence, if they expect inflation to be high in the future, they will\nwant to raise their price by more today in order to keep from being stuck with a price that is too low.\n3\n\nOf course, the existence of this empirical short-run tradeoff between inflation and\nunemployment also helped motivate the development of the New Keynesian model in the first\nplace. In particular, with no frictions and with fully maximizing agents, markets should always\nclear, and the labor market should be no exception. Thus, the short-run Phillips curve “should\nbe” vertical.5 This divergence between theory and reality was the original motivation for\nKeynesian economics. But in contrast to the ad hoc behavioral assumptions underlying old-style\nKeynesian theory, modern researchers have “amended” the neoclassical model with well-\nspecified assumptions concerning the nature of preferences, the process of decisionmaking, the\nfrictions characterizing markets, and the details of expectation formation. The objective has\nbeen to build models on sound microfoundations that are not only rigorous but also realistic.\nViewed in this light, the now standard New Keynesian approach explains the short-run\nPhillips curve tradeoff by introducing a key “friction” into neoclassical theory, namely, price-\nstickiness; such a friction is often justified as a menu cost of changing nominal prices. The\nconsequence is that firms change the prices they charge only periodically, not continuously.\nWith staggered decisionmaking across pricesetters, the aggregate price level exhibits inertia,\nrationalizing the short-run Phillips curve tradeoff. Other frictions, such as wage rigidity and\nhabit persistence in consumption, are typically added to improve the fit of the model.\nBehavioral macroeconomic models have extended this agenda, both by providing new\njustifications for wage and price rigidity and by incorporating additional departures from the\nfrictionless benchmark. Of course, the jury is still out on which modifications are most important\nempirically for understanding the macroeconomy. Nevertheless, the evidence presented\n5 In a simple version of the New Keynesian Phillips curve, Mankiw (2001) shows that the slope of the\ncurve is αλ2/1-λ, where λ is the fraction of agents that adjust their prices each period and α is the response of the\ndesired real price to movements in the unemployment gap with a small value of α reflecting greater real rigidity.\nWith perfectly flexible wages and prices, λ = 1 and the curve is vertical.\n4\n\nthroughout this conference regarding how people behave is too compelling to simply ignore. Let\nme discuss a few examples of behavioral macroeconomics.\nSome behavioral models assume that people follow simple heuristics or rules of thumb\nthat require relatively little cognitive effort or time (such as focusing on only a few salient details\nof a problem). Indeed, the psychology and economics literature that builds on the work of\nKahneman, Tversky, and others generally concludes that people do not make decisions in the\nfully rational way commonly envisioned in standard macroeconomic models. As Benjamin and\nLaibson (2003) summarize the findings of this literature: “Economic agents make good decisions\nbut not perfectly rational ones.”\nOther behavioral models, including those surveyed by Fehr, Goette, and Zehnder (2007)\nand by Rotemberg (2007) at this conference, go much further, arguing that individual behavior is\naffected by a reliance on nominal frames of reference and by considerations such as fairness,\nenvy, social status, and social norms. As Rotemberg makes clear, such assumptions can also\nrationalize the phenomenon of “price-stickiness” embodied in the Phillips curve.\nOf course a logical question is why such additional complexities are worth incorporating\ninto macro models if the New Keynesian approach, based on costly price adjustment, is\nempirically satisfactory. The problem is that the New Keynesian Phillips curve is not fully\nsatisfactory. For example, it is not consistent with contractionary disinflations or with the\ninflation persistence observed in the postwar period. It also is not consistent with empirical\nestimates of the joint responses of unemployment and inflation to monetary shocks.6\nBehaviorally based macroeconomic models help address these concerns about the New\nKeynesian Phillips curve, notably by modifying the process of expectations formation, the\n6 Mankiw (2001) highlights these critiques.\n5\n\nfeedback between expected future inflation and current inflation, the link between labor market\nconditions and firms’ marginal cost, and the impact of “supply shocks” on the inflation process.\nThey also offer new insights. For example, Mankiw and Reis (2002) assume that\ndecisionmakers form expectations using “sticky” or stale information, an assumption they justify\non behavioral grounds. To keep their model more tractable, they assume that all agents act as if\nthey had rational expectations, but most use outdated information. With this amendment of the\nstandard New Keynesian model, the Mankiw-Reis version generates a short-run Phillips curve\nthat is downward-sloping and that is consistent with inflation persistence and costly disinflation.\nOf course, the assumption of rational expectations, which Mankiw and Reis maintain, is a\nclear, but probably unrealistic, benchmark. Ball (2000) suggests, on near-rationality grounds,\nthat perhaps people forecast with optimal univariate estimation rather than acting as if they knew\nthe entire model.7 For the postwar period, this approach makes expected inflation close to being\nlast period’s inflation—so expectations depend heavily on recent experience. Inflation is thus\npersistent, but this persistence is not structural. An important implication for policy is that, if\npolicymakers change their behavior, the empirical dynamics of inflation could change markedly.\nLet me next turn to the long-run properties of the Phillips curve. Most macroeconomists\naccept that the long-run Phillips curve is vertical, so that steady-state unemployment is\nunaffected by the average level of inflation. Intriguingly, some behavioral models raise the\npossibility that steady-state unemployment might depend on the inflation rate.8 For example,\nAkerlof, Dickens, and Perry (2000) explore the implications of a model with money illusion, a\n7 A key motivation for Ball (2000) is that inflation appears very persistent in the postwar period but not\npersistent under the gold standard, which was a very different monetary regime. Common features of New\nKeynesian models, such as backward-looking agents or price indexing, can yield more persistence but not its\napparent regime-specific nature.\n8 Technically, in standard Phillips curve models, this relates to whether the coefficient on expected inflation\nis one.\n6\n\nphenomenon which, according to surveys and other empirical evidence, appears to be both\nwidespread and significant in decisionmaking. In their model, when inflation is sufficiently low,\nmost agents don’t focus on the difference between real and nominal variables, so inflation is\nrelatively unimportant for nominal wage bargains and for prices. As inflation rises, however, it\nbecomes salient to a growing fraction of agents who take it fully into account. This hypothesis\ngives rise to a long-run Phillips curve that is bowed in at very low inflation rates, backward\nbending at slightly higher rates, and ultimately vertical at the “natural rate” when inflation is\nsufficiently high. The implication is that a very small amount of inflation may lower equilibrium\nunemployment. Beyond a point, however, higher inflation raises equilibrium unemployment,\nsince inflation becomes an increasingly salient factor in decisionmaking. Akerlof et al. argue\nthat, in the late 1990s, as inflation fell to low levels, it became less salient to wage bargains,\nreducing the effective natural rate of unemployment.\nClosely related to the idea of money illusion is downward nominal wage rigidity which,\nas Fehr et al. discuss, may reflect considerations of fairness. Pervasive evidence of such nominal\nrigidity was identified, for example, by the International Wage Flexibility project (see Dickens et\nal., 2007). As Tobin (1972) originally showed, such downward nominal wage rigidity means\nthat, at sufficiently low inflation rates, a significant fraction of firms would optimally cut\nnominal wages. This possibility is explored in another paper by Akerlof, Dickens, and Perry\n(1996). In their model, if productivity growth and steady-state inflation are low, then long-run\nunemployment might be relatively high. The reason is that some firms might need to cut real\nwages which, at very low inflation, requires nominal wage cuts. If they’re unwilling or unable to\nimplement such cuts, then they may lay off workers instead. This reduction in labor demand\nleads to an increase in unemployment. Of course, if productivity growth is high, as it has been\n7\n\non average since the mid-1990s, then downward nominal wage rigidity becomes a less important\nissue.9 Behavioral considerations thus point to the possibility of a long-run tradeoff between\ninflation and unemployment at very low inflation rates.\nDownward nominal wage rigidity, as well as downward real wage rigidity, may also\naffect the linkages in the Phillips curve among unemployment, marginal cost, and inflation. In\nparticular, norms governing the pay increases that are deemed fair may result in a short-run\nPhillips curve that is convex rather than linear. The nonlinearity is due to the fact that, even with\nhigh unemployment rates, firms are unwilling to treat workers in ways they consider unfair--\neither cutting nominal wages or raising nominal wages by less than workers think they should\nreceive, causing inflation to “bottom out” as unemployment rises. For the United States, Clark,\nLaxton, and Rose (1996) find evidence of nonlinearity, although tests to discriminate among\nalternative functional forms of the Phillips curve suffer from extremely low power, making a\nreliable assessment of the degree of convexity impossible. The degree of convexity of the short-\nrun Phillips curve is potentially important, however, because the volatility of unemployment and\nmean unemployment are inversely related along paths with constant expected inflation. This\nmeans that policies to stabilize unemployment produce the payoff of lowering it on average.\nAnother implication of behavioral economics for the Phillips curve relates to the impact\nof productivity growth on equilibrium unemployment when real wages exhibit some rigidity, a\nphenomenon found by the International Wage Project to be prevalent in many countries. Ball\nand Moffitt (2001), for example, have shown that shifts in productivity growth, like other supply\nshocks, can shift the Phillips curve and thereby change, at least for a time, the equilibrium\nunemployment rate, or NAIRU. Behavioral economics suggests that norms may govern the real\n9 Recent productivity data have been, on balance, weaker than the average since the mid-1990s. But most,\nif not all, estimates of trend productivity growth remain above the average growth rate from 1973-1995.\n8\n\nwage increases that workers consider fair, and these norms or aspirations may be historically\nrooted. Shifts in productivity growth make it easier or more difficult for firms to meet these\nnorms, altering, at least for a time, the unemployment rate that is consistent with growth in real\nwages that is in line with productivity. During the 1990s, faster productivity growth enabled\nfirms to more easily meet norms for real wage growth that were depressed by the post-1973\nproductivity decline. In this view, the sluggish upward adjustment of norms enabled\nunemployment to fall to 40-year lows without igniting inflation. In essence, the short-run\nNAIRU was below its long-run level. By contrast, the poor experience of the 1970s reflected the\ncollision of inherited norms for rapid real wage growth with the unpleasant reality of a sharp\nproductivity slowdown.\nLet me wrap up these remarks on the implications of behavioral research for the\nproperties of the Phillips curve by noting that at least some of the behaviorally based insights\nhave already crept into our internal analysis and forecasts. For example, Federal Reserve\npolicymakers often attributed favorable inflation performance in the late 1990s to fast\nproductivity growth and its effect on the short-run NAIRU. And policy simulations with\nFRB/US, the Board of Governors’ main model, sometimes assume that agents form expectations\nby estimating reduced-form vector autoregressions rather than using model-consistent\nexpectations. Moreover, issues related to communications and credibility figure prominently in\nFOMC discussions, because members recognize that well-anchored inflation expectations, as we\nhave had in the United States since the mid-1980s, can reduce the sacrifice ratio and the\nsensitivity of inflation to supply shocks. More generally, the Federal Reserve recognizes that\npublic understanding of its reaction function can help people form expectations in ways that are\nlikely to enhance the stability of the economy. Given the importance that expectations formation\n9\n\nplays in all aspects of modern macroeconomic models, I see a high payoff to further behavioral\nresearch on how people actually form expectations. Moreover, behavioral research could be\nvery useful in helping us understand how best to communicate our views on the economy and on\npolicy.\nSo far, I have discussed how behavioral research affects our understanding of what policy\ncan do. I now want to draw on some of this discussion to address the question of what policy\nshould do--namely, what we can learn about the appropriate objectives of monetary policy.\nI’ll start with inflation. In the long run, everyone agrees that inflation primarily reflects\nthe actions of the central bank. But what inflation rate should we strive for as a long-run\nobjective? Existing theoretical work, grounded in neoclassical models, provides surprisingly\nlittle guidance. It points to the importance of “shoe-leather” costs, since individuals tend to\neconomize on their use of cash as inflation rises. However, these costs are probably small at low\nto moderate inflation. More important, in all likelihood, is the impact on the incentive to save\nand invest stemming from the interaction of inflation with the tax code. But behavioral\neconomics brings other considerations into play. Empirically, the evidence from surveys\nperformed by Shiller (1997) and those discussed by Di Tella and McCulloch (2007) at this\nconference, reveal that individuals strongly dislike inflation. It appears to reduce reported\nhappiness. Such evidence, along with evidence suggesting that individuals heavily rely on\nnominal frames of reference in decisionmaking, reinforce the desirability of keeping inflation\nquite low. After all, zero inflation, correctly measured, means that the distinction between real\nand nominal variables is unimportant; indeed, targeting a constant price level would make it\neasier for people to plan for the future. However, some considerations highlighted by behavioral\nresearch point in the opposite direction. For example, the tendency of workers to ignore inflation\n10\n\nin wage bargaining until it becomes salient and the prevalence of downward nominal wage\nrigidity suggest that there may be potential benefits from choosing an inflation target that is low\nbut positive. These arguments reinforce a case for some small inflation cushion to guard against\ndeflationary risks due to the “zero nominal bound” on interest rates. Although empirical work\nsuggests that downward nominal wage rigidity is prevalent in the United States, its importance\ndiminishes when productivity growth is high, as it has been since the mid-1990s.\nLet me next turn to some implications of behavioral economics for the Fed’s role in\nstabilizing the real economy. Along with price stability, output stabilization has been an\nimportant policy objective during the postwar period, and fluctuations in both output and\nunemployment have diminished. The questions for policymakers are how large are the welfare\nlosses that result from such output volatility and how beneficial would further reductions be?\nPerhaps surprisingly, standard economic theory suggests that the losses associated with\noutput volatility of the magnitude experienced during the postwar period are quite small. Lucas\n(1987, 2003) spawned a large literature by arguing that the welfare gains from additional\nstabilization of the economy are tiny. Given standard preferences and the observed variance of\nconsumption around a linear trend since 1947, he calculates that the representative American\nconsumer would be willing to reduce his average consumption by a trivial amount, only ½ of\n1/10th of a percent, to eliminate all remaining consumption volatility.10 Lucas concluded that\nstabilization of output, even if possible, should not be a macroeconomic priority.\n10 As Lucas (2003) makes clear, even taking his estimates at face value, such a calculation does not imply\nthat the Federal Reserve should ignore fluctuations. Very long, very deep downturns, such as the Great Depression,\nare costly, and policy has avoided such episodes during the postwar period, presumably averting sizeable welfare\ncosts.\n11\n\nIf Lucas’s calculation were correct, then the average person in the United States would\nvalue consumption stabilization (complete insurance) by only around $16 a year. 11 Compared\nwith the premiums we pay for very partial insurance (e.g., for collision coverage on our cars),\nthis seems implausibly low. The New Keynesian model offers one basis to conclude that the\ncosts may be larger. For example, Galí, Gertler, and López-Salido (2007) argue that, because of\nwage and price markups, steady-state employment and output are inefficiently low. In their\nmodel, the welfare effects of booms and recessions are asymmetric because marginal increases in\nemployment result in diminishing welfare gains. In good times, with low unemployment, the\nmarginal gain from additional job creation may be low, because marginal employees may be\nclose to indifferent between work and leisure. In contrast, job creation in bad times may yield a\nsizeable welfare surplus. As a result, recessions are particularly costly—welfare falls by more\nduring a business-cycle downturn than it rises during a symmetric expansion. If good policy\nreduces the frequency and severity of recessions, then the analysis of Galí et al. suggests that the\nresulting welfare gains may be substantial.\nBehavioral considerations suggest some additional reasons why output stabilization may\nraise welfare. In particular, some of the behavioral phenomena discussed previously create the\ntantalizing prospect that a more stable economy may benefit from higher average levels of\nemployment, output, and consumption. As DeLong and Summers (1988, p. 434) once put it,\nstabilization might “…fill in troughs without shaving off peaks.” 12 Or, as in Barlevy (2004),\nstabilization might increase the economy’s long-run growth rate. In contrast, both the\nneoclassical model, analyzed by Lucas, and the New Keynesian model, analyzed by Galí et al.\n11 Reis (2007) suggests this way of framing the benefits of stabilization.\n12 Yellen and Akerlof (2004) survey this literature.\n12\n\npredict that mean consumption, output, and unemployment are unaffected by the volatility of\nthese variables.\nOne behavioral reason that a more stable economy might enjoy lower average\nunemployment relates to the convexity of the short-run Phillips curve. If this relationship is\nconvex, rather than linear, higher volatility in unemployment is associated with a higher mean.\nRecall that such convexity could reflect the influence of downward rigidity in either nominal or\nreal wages. Interestingly, using U.S. data for the period 1971 to 1995, Debelle and Laxton\n(1997) estimate that the increase in mean unemployment associated with the volatility in\nunemployment over this period amounted to a nontrivial 0.33%.13 Yellen and Akerlof (2004)\nshow that a similar argument applies if the long-run Phillips curve is not vertical at low inflation\nrates.\nFor policymakers, the bottom line of such research is that behavioral economic models\ntend to reinforce the priority that policymakers should attach to the goal of stabilizing output.\nBut the magnitude of the possible gains are difficult to infer from existing empirical estimates of\nthe Phillips curve. In principle, the happiness literature might give us some more direct evidence\non these benefits. As Di Tella and McCulloch emphasize in their paper, there is persuasive\nevidence that happiness is inversely correlated with both unemployment and inflation. The\nfinding that lower unemployment raises satisfaction even when it is fairly low to start with is\nconsistent with the New Keynesian assumption that equilibrium unemployment is inefficiently\nhigh. But this finding sheds little light on how policymakers should assess the welfare\nconsequences of fluctuations. This hinges on the more subtle issue of how volatility in\n13 0.33% is the estimated difference between the average historical rate of unemployment and the\ndeterministic NAIRU, defined as the unemployment rate consistent with nonaccelerating inflation in the absence of\nshocks.\n13\n\nunemployment affects well-being for a given mean. On this point Wolfers (2003), using\nsubjective measures of satisfaction, found evidence of nonlinearity in the relationship between\nlife satisfaction and unemployment, implying that unemployment volatility does undermine well-\nbeing. Even so, Wolfers found that the welfare benefits of reducing volatility are subject to\nrapidly diminishing returns, so that further reductions in the volatility of unemployment would\nraise welfare by only a relatively small amount, albeit by more than Lucas’s estimate.\nThere’s a lot more work to be done here to validate and confirm that happiness responses\ncorrespond to well-being. 14 In addition, we care about more than just whether people are happy;\nwe’d like to understand why. There is considerable scope for more refined survey evidence that\nfocuses more precisely on what it is that people dislike about unemployment and inflation, and\nwhy.15\nLet me conclude by summarizing what I think policymakers can learn from behavioral\nresearch bearing on the Phillips curve. This research provides clearcut evidence that people\noften deviate from the way that benchmark neoclassical theories assume. People have money\nillusion, follow rules of thumb, and care about issues like fairness and equity. As I’ve discussed,\nthere’s a growing body of literature that shows that macroeconomic theories built on behavioral\nfoundations have strikingly different implications from more standard theories. Behavioral\nresearch thus offers the promise of unified theories that can explain microeconomic behavior as\nwell as the movements of macroeconomic aggregates.\nWith respect to the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate, behavioral research supports the\nview that inflation is costly, although very modest inflation might help protect against downward\n14 Responses do appear correlated with things like income, employment status, education, marital status,\nand so forth. And there is some evidence that these measures are, in turn, mirrored in suicide data (see Daly,\nWilson, and Johnson, 2007), which is clearly of a very objective nature.\n15 Shiller (1997) took this approach in asking people about inflation.\n14\n\nnominal wage rigidity. Behavioral macroeconomic models also provide theoretical\nunderpinnings for the view held by most policymakers that, in the short run, monetary policy can\nand should strive to stabilize the real economy.\nIn sum, research on behavioral economics is as exciting for policymakers as it is for\nacademics. It helps policymakers understand what they should care about and improves the\nquality of our economic models. The work at this conference highlights some of the progress\nthat has been made, but also suggests that the marginal product of further research in behavioral\neconomics is still likely to be very high.\n# # #\n15\n\nReferences\nAkerlof, George A., William T.

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“The New Normal Monetary Policy,” a research conference\nsponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nSan Francisco, California\nMarch 27, 2015\n\nI would like to thank President Williams for his kind introduction and the Federal\nReserve Bank of San Francisco for inviting me to what promises to be a very stimulating\nand important conference.\nAs you know, last week the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) changed\nits forward guidance pertaining to the federal funds rate. With continued improvement in\neconomic conditions, an increase in the target range for that rate may well be warranted\nlater this year. Of course, the timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate and its\nsubsequent path will be determined by the Committee in light of incoming data on labor\nmarket conditions, inflation, and other aspects of the current expansion.\nIn my remarks today I will discuss some factors that will likely guide our\ndecisions as we adjust the stance of monetary policy over time. I will also discuss why\nmost of my colleagues and I believe the return of the federal funds rate to a more normal\nlevel is likely to be gradual. In doing so, I will address three questions. First, why does\nthe Committee judge that an increase in the federal funds rate target is likely to become\nappropriate later this year? Second, how are economic and financial considerations likely\nto shape the course of monetary policy over the next several years? And, finally, are\nthere special risks and other considerations that policymakers should take into account in\nthe current environment?\nCurrent Economic Conditions and the Outlook\nBefore turning to these questions, however, let me first review where the\neconomy is now and where it’s likely headed--a necessary backdrop for understanding\nwhy, after more than six years of maintaining a near-zero federal funds rate and\naccumulating a large portfolio of longer-term securities, the Committee is now giving\n\n- 2 -\nserious consideration to beginning to reduce later this year some of the extraordinary\nmonetary policy accommodation currently in place.\nAlthough the recovery of the labor market from the deep recession following the\nfinancial crisis was frustratingly slow for quite a long time, progress has been more rapid\nof late. The unemployment rate has fallen markedly over the past few years and now\nstands at 5.5 percent, down from 10 percent at its peak. Payroll gains have averaged\n275,000 per month over the past year, well above the pace needed to sustain further\ndeclines in the unemployment rate. Of course, we still have some way to go to reach our\nmaximum employment goal. The unemployment rate has not yet declined to the 5.0 to\n5.2 percent range that most FOMC participants now consider to be normal in the longer\nrun. Involuntary part-time employment remains high by historical standards. Labor\nforce participation is still somewhat lower than I would expect after accounting for\ndemographic trends.1 And wage growth continues to be quite subdued. But I think we\ncan all agree that the recovery in the labor market has been substantial.\nI am cautiously optimistic that, in the context of moderate growth in aggregate\noutput and spending, labor market conditions are likely to improve further in coming\nmonths. In particular, and despite the somewhat disappointing tone of the recent retail\n1 For a discussion of the influence of demographics and other factors on the labor force participation rate in\nrecent years, see Stephanie Aaronson, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis-Reig, Christopher Smith,\nand William Wascher (2014), “Labor Force Participation: Recent Developments and Future Prospects,”\nBrookings Papers on Economic Activity (Washington: Brookings Institution, Fall),\nwww.brookings.edu/about/projects/bpea/papers/2014/labor-force-participation-recent-developments-and-\nfuture-prospects. In addition, for evidence that the labor force participation rate is currently unusually low\nfrom a cyclical perspective, see Robert E. Hall (2014), “Quantifying the Lasting Harm to the U.S. Economy\nfrom the Financial Crisis,” in Jonathan Parker and Michael Woodford, eds., NBER Macroeconomics\nAnnual 2014, vol. 29 (Chicago: University of Chicago Press); and Council of Economic Advisers (2014),\n“The Labor Force Participation Rate since 2007: Causes and Policy Implications” (Washington: CEA,\nJuly), www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/labor_force_participation_report.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\nsales data, I think consumer spending is likely to expand at a good clip this year given\nsuch robust fundamentals as strong employment gains, boosts to real incomes from lower\nenergy prices, continued increases in household wealth, and a relatively high level of\nconsumer confidence. Of course, not all sectors of the economy are doing as well: dollar\nappreciation appears to be restraining net exports, low oil prices are prompting a cutback\nin drilling activity, and the recovery in residential construction remains subdued. But\noverall, I anticipate that real gross domestic product is likely to expand somewhat faster\nthan its potential in coming quarters, thereby promoting further gains in employment and\ndeclines in the unemployment rate.\nIn assessing the actual strength of the labor market and the broader economy, we\nmust bear in mind that these very welcome improvements have been achieved in the\ncontext of extraordinary monetary accommodation. While the overall level of real\nactivity now appears to be much closer to its potential than it was a year or two ago, the\neconomy in an “underlying” sense remains quite weak by historical standards, for the\nsimple reason that the increases in hiring and output that have been achieved thus far\nhave required exceptionally low levels of short- and longer-term interest rates, reflecting\na highly accommodative stance of monetary policy. Interest rates have been, and remain,\nvery low, and if underlying conditions had truly returned to normal, the economy should\nbe booming. As I will discuss shortly, this assessment concerning the underlying\nstrength of real activity has important policy implications.\nWhile there has been considerable progress on the maximum employment leg of\nour dual mandate, progress on the price stability leg has been notably absent. Inflation as\nmeasured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures has been running\n\n- 4 -\nbelow the FOMC’s longer-run goal of 2 percent for a number of years, and on a\n12-month basis is currently 1/4 percent. Some of the weakness in inflation likely reflects\ncontinuing slack in labor and product markets. However, much of this weakness stems\nfrom the sharp decline in the price of oil and other one-time factors that, in the FOMC’s\njudgment, are likely to have only a transitory negative effect on inflation, provided that\ninflation expectations remain well anchored.\nIn this regard, I take comfort from the continued stability of survey measures of\nlonger-run inflation expectations. And although market-based measures of inflation\ncompensation have declined appreciably since last summer and bear close watching, I\nsuspect that these declines are primarily driven by changes in risk premiums and market\nfactors that I expect to prove transitory. On balance, I therefore think it is appropriate for\nmonetary policy to remain accommodative for some time, fostering an environment of\ntightening labor and product markets that, together with stable inflation expectations, will\nhelp move inflation up to 2 percent over the medium term.\nWhy Might an Increase in the Federal Funds Rate Be Warranted Later This Year?\nThe Committee's decision about when to begin reducing accommodation will\ndepend importantly on how economic conditions actually evolve over time. Like most of\nmy FOMC colleagues, I believe that the appropriate time has not yet arrived, but I expect\nthat conditions may warrant an increase in the federal funds rate target sometime this\nyear. So let me spell out the reasoning that underpins this view.\nI would first note that the current stance of monetary policy is clearly providing\nconsiderable economic stimulus. The near-zero setting for the federal funds rate has\nfacilitated a sizable reduction in labor market slack over the past two years and appears to\n\n- 5 -\nbe consistent with further substantial gains. A modest increase in the federal funds rate\nwould be highly unlikely to halt this progress, although such an increase might slow its\npace somewhat.\nSecond, we need to keep in mind the well-established fact that the full effects of\nmonetary policy are felt only after long lags. This means that policymakers cannot wait\nuntil they have achieved their objectives to begin adjusting policy. I would not consider\nit prudent to postpone the onset of normalization until we have reached, or are on the\nverge of reaching, our inflation objective. Doing so would create too great a risk of\nsignificantly overshooting both our objectives of maximum sustainable employment and\n2 percent inflation, potentially undermining economic growth and employment if the\nFOMC is subsequently forced to tighten policy markedly or abruptly. In addition,\nholding rates too low for too long could encourage inappropriate risk-taking by investors,\npotentially undermining the stability of financial markets. That said, we must be\nreasonably confident at the time of the first rate increase that inflation will move up over\ntime to our 2 percent objective, and that such an action will not impede continued solid\ngrowth in employment and output.\nAn important factor working to increase my confidence in the inflation outlook\nwill be continued improvement in the labor market. A substantial body of theory,\ninformed by considerable historical evidence, suggests that inflation will eventually begin\nto rise as resource utilization continues to tighten.2 It is largely for this reason that a\n2 For recent evidence on the relationship between labor market slack and wages, see Anil Kumar and Pia\nOrrenius (2014), “A Closer Look at the Phillips Curve Using State Level Data,” Working Papers 1409\n(Dallas: Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas),\nwww.dallasfed.org/assets/documents/research/papers/2014/wp1409.pdf; and Daniel Aaronson and Andrew\nJordan (2014), “Understanding the Relationship between Real Wage Growth and Labor Market\nConditions,” Chicago Fed Letter No. 327 (Chicago: Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, October),\nwww.chicagofed.org/publications/chicago-fed-letter/2014/october-327. The price Phillips curve is\n\n- 6 -\nsignificant pickup in incoming readings on core inflation will not be a precondition for\nme to judge that an initial increase in the federal funds rate would be warranted. With\nrespect to wages, I anticipate that real wage gains for American workers are likely to pick\nup to a rate more in line with trend labor productivity growth as employment settles in at\nits maximum sustainable level. We could see nominal wage growth eventually running\nnotably higher than the current roughly 2 percent pace. But the outlook for wages is\nhighly uncertain even if price inflation does move back to 2 percent and labor market\nconditions continue to improve as projected. For example, we cannot be sure about the\nfuture pace of productivity growth; nor can we be sure about other factors, such as global\ncompetition, the nature of technological change, and trends in unionization, that may also\ninfluence the pace of real wage growth over time. These factors, which are outside of the\nFederal Reserve’s control, likely explain why real wages have failed to keep pace with\nproductivity growth for at least the past 15 years. For such reasons, we can never be sure\nwhat growth rate of nominal wages is consistent with stable consumer price inflation, and\nthis uncertainty limits the usefulness of wage trends as an indicator of the Fed’s progress\nin achieving its inflation objective.\nI have argued that a pickup in neither wage nor price inflation is indispensable for\nme to achieve reasonable confidence that inflation will move back to 2 percent over time.\nThat said, I would be uncomfortable raising the federal funds rate if readings on wage\ndiscussed extensively in the literature; for instance, see Robert J. Gordon (2013), “The Phillips Curve Is\nAlive and Well: Inflation and the NAIRU during the Slow Recovery,” NBER Working Paper Series 19390\n(Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, August). In addition, the apparent lack of\ndisinflationary pressure seen during the recent recession is not necessarily a puzzle for the New Keynesian\nPhillips curve, as shown in Marco Del Negro, Marc P. Giannoni, and Frank Schorfheide (2015), “Inflation\nin the Great Recession and New Keynesian Models,” American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics,\nvol. 7 (January), pp. 168-96.\n\n- 7 -\ngrowth, core consumer prices, and other indicators of underlying inflation pressures were\nto weaken, if market-based measures of inflation compensation were to fall appreciably\nfurther, or if survey-based measures were to begin to decline noticeably.\nUnder normal circumstances, simple monetary policy rules, such as the one\nproposed by John Taylor, could help us decide when to raise the federal funds rate.3\nEven with core inflation running below the Committee's 2 percent objective, Taylor’s\nrule now calls for the federal funds rate to be well above zero if the unemployment rate is\ncurrently judged to be close to its normal longer-run level and the “normal” level of the\nreal federal funds rate is currently close to its historical average. But the prescription\noffered by the Taylor rule changes significantly if one instead assumes, as I do, that\nappreciable slack still remains in the labor market, and that the economy’s equilibrium\nreal federal funds rate--that is, the real rate consistent with the economy achieving\nmaximum employment and price stability over the medium term--is currently quite low\nby historical standards.4 Under assumptions that I consider more realistic under present\ncircumstances, the same rules call for the federal funds rate to be close to zero.5\n3 For the original exposition of the Taylor rule, see John B. Taylor (1993), “Discretion Versus Policy Rules\nin Practice,” Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy, vol. 39, pp. 195-214. For a\ndiscussion of policy rules in general, see John B. Taylor and John C. Williams (2010), “Simple and Robust\nRules for Monetary Policy,” in Benjamin M. Friedman and Michael Woodford, eds., Handbook of\nMonetary Economics, vol. 3B (San Diego: Elsevier), pp. 829-59.\n4 The equilibrium real rate is typically viewed as the level of the short-term interest rate, less inflation,\nestimated to be consistent with maximum employment and stable inflation in the long run, assuming no\nfuture disturbances to the economy. Accordingly, the equilibrium real rate is usually thought of as\nindependent of the cyclical disturbances that routinely buffet the economy, on the assumption that the\ninfluences of such disturbances on real activity and inflation fade away after a few years. In the aftermath\nof the financial crisis, however, the U.S. economy has been subject to various adjustment processes that are\nunusually drawn out by historical standards, such as the ongoing repair of household balance sheets and\nother persistent headwinds. These atypical processes imply that, in determining the appropriate stance of\nmonetary policy over time, policymakers in the current environment need to take account of slow-moving\ninfluences on both aggregate demand and supply that were not important factors during previous tightening\nepisodes. For this reason, it is useful to think of the equilibrium real rate in present circumstances as not\nonly time-varying but also having a predictable element that evolves over the medium term.\n5 For example, the Taylor rule is , where R denotes the federal funds\nrate, RR* is the estimated value of the equ∗ilibrium real rate, π is the current inflation rate (usually measured\n𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 =𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 +𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+0.5(𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−2)+0.5𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡\n\n- 8 -\nMoreover, I would assert that simple rules are, well, too simple, and ignore important\ncomplexities of the current situation, about which I will have more to say shortly.\nThe FOMC will, of course, carefully deliberate about when to begin the process\nof removing policy accommodation. But the significance of this decision should not be\noveremphasized, because what matters for financial conditions and the broader economy\nis the entire expected path of short-term interest rates and not the precise timing of the\nfirst rate increase. The spending and investment decisions the FOMC seeks to influence\ndepend primarily on expectations of policy well into the future, as embedded in longer-\nterm interest rates and other asset prices. More important than the timing of the\nCommittee’s initial policy move will be the strategy the Committee deploys in adjusting\nthe federal funds rate over time, in response to economic developments, to achieve its\ndual mandate. Market participants’ perceptions of that reaction function and the\nimplications for the likely longer-run trajectory of short-term interest rates will influence\nthe borrowing costs faced by households and businesses, including the rates on corporate\nbonds, auto loans, and home mortgages.\nHow Are Economic and Financial Considerations Likely to Shape the Course of\nMonetary Policy over the Next Several Years?\nLet me therefore turn to the second question I posed earlier: How are economic\nand financial considerations likely to shape the course of monetary policy over the next\nusing a core consumer price index), and Y is the output gap. The latter can be approximated using Okun’s\nlaw, , where U is the unemployment rate and U* is the natural rate of unemployment. If\nRR* is assumed to equ∗al 2 percent (roughly the average historical value of the real federal funds rate) and\nU* is𝑌𝑌 𝑡𝑡 as=su−m2ed(𝑈𝑈 to 𝑡𝑡 −eq𝑈𝑈ual) 5-1/2 percent, then the Taylor rule would call for the nominal funds rate to be set a\nbit below 3 percent currently, given that core PCE inflation is now running close to 1-1/4 percent and the\nunemployment rate is 5.5 percent. But if RR* is instead assumed to equal 0 percent currently (as some\nstatistical models suggest) and U* is assumed to equal 5 percent (an estimate in line with many FOMC\nparticipants’ SEP projections), then the rule’s current prescription is less than 1/2 percent.\n\n- 9 -\nfew years? Let me first be clear that the FOMC does not intend to embark on any\npredetermined course of tightening following an initial decision to raise the funds rate\ntarget range--one that, for example, would involve similarly sized rate increases at every\nmeeting or on some other schedule. Rather, the actual path of policy will evolve as\neconomic conditions evolve, and policy tightening could speed up, slow down, pause, or\neven reverse course depending on actual and expected developments in real activity and\ninflation. Reflecting such data dependence, as well as some historically unusual policy\nconsiderations that I will discuss shortly, the average pace of tightening observed during\nprevious recoveries could well provide a highly misleading guide to the actual course of\nmonetary policy over the next few years. Our goal in adjusting the federal funds rate\nover time will be to achieve and sustain economic conditions close to maximum\nemployment with inflation averaging around 2 percent, responding, as best we can, to the\ninevitable twists and turns of the economy.\nKeeping in mind the all-important proviso that policy is never predetermined but\nis always data dependent, what can we say about the appropriate path of policy, assuming\nthe most likely outcomes for real activity, inflation, and related factors? The answer is\nthat it depends, of course, on one’s outlook for the economy. Today I will focus on the\nmodal outlook presented by FOMC participants’ submissions to the March Summary of\nEconomic Projections (SEP), which assumes that no further unanticipated disturbances\nbuffet the economy. As I noted at my press conference after last week’s FOMC meeting,\nparticipants generally project that the unemployment rate will continue to fall through\nlate 2017 to levels at or somewhat below estimates of its longer-run sustainable level,\naccompanied by growth in real gross domestic product that runs somewhat above its\n\n- 10 -\nestimated longer-run trend with inflation moving up to around 2 percent. This solid\neconomic performance is projected to be consistent with a gradual normalization of\nmonetary policy: The median funds rate projection in the March SEP increases\na percentage point per year on average through the end of 2017.\nThe projected combination of a gradual rise in the nominal federal funds rate\ncoupled with further progress on both legs of the dual mandate is consistent with an\nimplicit assessment by the Committee that the equilibrium real federal funds rate--one\nmeasure of the economy’s underlying strength--is rising only slowly over time. In the\nwake of the financial crisis, the equilibrium real rate apparently fell well below zero\nbecause of numerous persistent headwinds. These headwinds include tighter underwriting\nstandards and restricted access to some forms of credit; the need for households to reduce\ntheir debt burdens; contractionary fiscal policy at all levels of government after the initial\neffects of the fiscal stimulus package had passed; and elevated uncertainty about the\neconomic outlook that made firms hesitant to invest and hire, and households reluctant to\nbuy houses, cars, and other discretionary goods.\nFortunately, the overall force of these headwinds appears to have diminished\nconsiderably over the past year or so, allowing employment to accelerate appreciably\neven as the level of the federal funds rate and the volume of our asset holdings remained\nnearly unchanged.6 Stated differently, the economy’s underlying strength has been\n6 Although the FOMC suspended its asset purchase program last October, the stimulus provided by this\ntype of unconventional monetary policy action depends primarily on the stock of longer-term assets held by\nthe Federal Reserve, not the flow of securities bought. Because the FOMC has held the size of the Federal\nReserve’s balance sheet constant since October while continuing to keep the federal funds rate near zero,\nthe overall stance of monetary policy is thus little changed over this period. However, the downward\npressure on long-term interest rates from the Federal Reserve’s asset holdings should decline over time,\nparticularly after the FOMC suspends its current reinvestment policy, because the average duration of the\nassets held in the portfolio will be steadily falling and because the relative size of the portfolio to the stock\nof publicly held debt will be shrinking.\n\n- 11 -\ngradually improving, and the equilibrium real federal funds rate has been gradually\nrising. Although the recent appreciation of the dollar is likely to weigh on U.S. exports\nover time, I nonetheless anticipate further diminution of the headwinds just noted over\nthe next couple of years, and as the equilibrium real funds rate continues to rise, it will\naccordingly be appropriate to raise the actual level of the real federal funds rate in\ntandem, all else being equal.7 At present, the equilibrium real federal funds rate, which\nby some estimates is currently close to zero, appears to be well below the longer-run\nnormal levels assessed by the FOMC. The median SEP estimate of this longer-run\nnormal rate--that is, the long-run projection of the nominal funds rate less 2 percent\ninflation--stood at 1-3/4 percent in the FOMC's recent projections.8 Provided that\ninflation shows clear signs over time of moving up toward 2 percent in the context of\ncontinuing progress toward maximum employment, I therefore expect that a further\ntightening in monetary policy after the first increase in the federal funds rate will be\nwarranted. Should incoming data, however, fail to support this forecast, then the actual\npath of policy will need to be adjusted appropriately.\n7 If resource utilization was at a normal level and inflation was equal to 2 percent, policymakers would\npresumably opt to set the real federal funds rate equal to the equilibrium real rate in order to maintain those\nconditions. Accordingly, if the equilibrium rate is rising over time, the “neutral” setting of monetary policy\nshould be rising in tandem.\n8 For example, the estimate of the equilibrium real rate from the Laubach-Williams model for 2014:Q4 is\nnegative 0.16. For information on the model, see Thomas Laubach and John C. Williams (2003),\n“Measuring the Natural Rate of Interest,” Review of Economics and Statistics, vol. 85 (November),\npp. 1063-70; updated estimates of the baseline model are available on the Federal Reserve Bank of San\nFrancisco website at www.frbsf.org/economic-research/economists/john-\nwilliams/Laubach_Williams_updated_estimates.xlsx. Another recent study, however, concludes that the\nequilibrium real rate is probably in the range of 1 to 2 percent while also emphasizing that estimates in this\narea are quite imprecise; see James D. Hamilton, Ethan S. Harris, Jan Hatzius, and Kenneth D. West\n(2015), “The Equilibrium Real Funds Rate: Past, Present, and Future,” working paper (San Diego:\nUniversity of California at San Diego, March), http://econweb.ucsd.edu/~jhamilto/USMPF_2015.pdf.\nNote that the concept of the equilibrium real rate used in the latter study is explicitly long-run in nature and\nso excludes the effects of forces that have persistently restrained the pace of the current expansion but are\nexpected to eventually fade away, such as household balance sheet repair; for this reason, the paper’s\nestimate is higher than the medium-run concept of the equilibrium real rate discussed in the speech.\n\n- 12 -\nAre There Special Risks and Other Considerations That Policymakers Should Take\ninto Account in the Current Environment?\nAs I noted, my FOMC colleagues and I generally anticipate that a rather gradual\nrise in the federal funds rate will be appropriate over the next few years, conditional on\nour baseline forecasts for real activity, inflation, and other aspects of the economy’s\nperformance. So far in my remarks, I have emphasized one key rationale for such a\njudgment--namely, that the equilibrium real federal funds rate is at present well below its\nhistorical average and is anticipated to rise only gradually over time as the various\nheadwinds that have restrained the economic recovery continue to abate. If incoming\ndata support such a forecast, the federal funds rate should be normalized, but at a gradual\npace.\nSeveral additional factors reinforce this conclusion, and that brings me to my third\nquestion: Are there special risks and other considerations that policymakers should take\ninto account in the current environment? Keeping in mind that the actual course of\nmonetary policy in the future will primarily depend on events as they unfold, I see three\nadditional considerations that are relevant.9\nThe first, which is closely related to my expectation that the headwinds holding\nback growth are likely to continue to abate gradually, pertains to the risk that the\nequilibrium real federal funds rate may not, in fact, recover as much or as quickly as I\n9 In principle, the three considerations--uncertainty about the value of the equilibrium real federal funds\nrate, the asymmetric risks associated with the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates, and the potential\nbenefits of allowing the unemployment rate to temporarily undershoot its sustainable longer-run rate--\nshould influence both the timing of the onset of policy normalization and the subsequent pace at which that\nnormalization proceeds. And in fact, I view all three considerations as helping to explain why the FOMC\nhas held the federal funds rate near zero for so long. I also view such considerations as consistent with a\nlikely increase in the target federal funds rate later this year, because such an increase would be part of a\nbroader strategy for only gradually reducing accommodation over time (subject, of course, to adjustments\nin response to incoming information on real activity, inflation, and other factors).\n\n- 13 -\nanticipate. Substantial uncertainty surrounds all estimates of the equilibrium real interest\nrate, and, as I will discuss momentarily, market participants appear to be fairly\npessimistic about the odds that it will rise significantly over time. Moreover, some recent\nstudies have raised the prospect that the economies of the United States and other\ncountries will grow more slowly in the future as a result of both demographic factors and\na slower pace of productivity gains from technological advances. At an extreme, such\ndevelopments could even amount to a type of “secular stagnation,” in which monetary\npolicy would need to keep real interest rates persistently quite low relative to historical\nnorms to promote full employment and price stability, absent a highly expansive fiscal\npolicy.10\nSuch a risk has important implications for monetary policy in the near term, when\nthe ability of the economy to adjust to significant rate increases will be especially\nuncertain. The experience of Japan over the past 20 years, and Sweden more recently,\ndemonstrates that a tightening of policy when the equilibrium real rate remains low can\nresult in appreciable economic costs, delaying the attainment of a central bank’s price\nstability objective. International experience therefore counsels caution in removing\naccommodation until the Committee is more confident that aggregate demand will\n10 The concept of “secular stagnation” was first coined back in the late 1930s; see Alvin H. Hansen (1938),\n“The Consequences of Reducing Expenditures,” Proceedings of the Academy of Political Science, vol. 17\n(January), pp. 60-72; and Alvin H. Hansen (1939), “Economic Progress and Declining Population\nGrowth,” American Economic Review, vol. 29 (March), pp. 1-15. This possibility, and its applicability to\nthe United States and other developed economies in coming years, has received considerable attention of\nlate; see Robert J. Gordon (2014), “The Demise of U.S. Economic Growth: Restatement, Rebuttal, and\nReflections,” NBER Working Paper Series 19895 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic\nResearch, February); Robert E. Hall (2014), “Quantifying the Lasting Harm to the U.S. Economy from the\nFinancial Crisis,” in Jonathan Parker and Michael Woodford, eds., NBER Macroeconomics Annual, vol. 29\n(Chicago: University of Chicago Press); and Lawrence H. Summers (2014), “U.S. Economic Prospects:\nSecular Stagnation, Hysteresis, and the Zero Lower Bound,” Business Economics, vol. 49 (April),\npp. 65-73. For a more skeptical assessment of the secular stagnation hypothesis, see Hamilton and others,\n“The Equilibrium Real Funds Rate,” in note 8.\n\n- 14 -\ncontinue to expand in line with its expectations--a view that is also supported by the\nresearch literature.11\nA second reason for the Committee to proceed cautiously in removing policy\naccommodation relates to asymmetries in the effectiveness of monetary policy in the\nvicinity of the zero lower bound. In the event that growth in employment and overall\nactivity proves unexpectedly robust and inflation moves significantly above our 2 percent\nobjective, the FOMC can and will raise interest rates as needed to rein in inflation. But if\ngrowth was to falter and inflation was to fall yet further, the effective lower bound on\nnominal interest rates could limit the Committee’s ability to provide the needed degree of\naccommodation. With an already large balance sheet, for example, the FOMC might be\nconcerned about potential costs and risks associated with further asset purchases.\nResearch suggests that, the higher the probability of monetary policy becoming\nconstrained by the zero lower bound in the near future because of adverse shocks, and the\nmore severe the attendant consequences for real activity and inflation, the more current\npolicy should lean in accommodative direction.12 In effect, such a strategy represents\ninsurance against the zero lower bound by aiming for somewhat stronger real activity and\n11 A number of studies have shown, using model simulations, that policymakers can improve\nmacroeconomic performance by adjusting the stance of monetary policy more cautiously in response to\nchanges in economic conditions when the economy’s equilibrium real interest rate is uncertain. For a\nsurvey of the literature on this issue, see John B. Taylor and John C. Williams (2010), “Simple and Robust\nRules for Monetary Policy,” in Benjamin M. Friedman and Michael Woodford, eds., Handbook of\nMonetary Economics, vol. 3B (San Diego: Elsevier), pp. 829-59.\n12 For example, see Klaus Adam and Roberto M. Billi (2007), “Discretionary Monetary Policy and the Zero\nLower Bound on Nominal Interest Rates,” Journal of Monetary Economics, vol. 54 (3), 728-52; Taisuke\nNakata (2013), “Optimal Fiscal and Monetary Policy with Occasionally Binding Zero Bound Constraints,”\nFinance and Economics Discussion Series 2013-40 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System, April), www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2013/201340/201340pap.pdf; Taisuke Nakata\n(2013), “Uncertainty at the Zero Lower Bound,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2013-09\n(Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, December 2012),\nwww.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2013/201309/201309pap.pdf; and Charles Evans, Jonas Fisher, Francois\nGourio, and Spencer Krane (forthcoming), “Risk Management for Monetary Policy Near the Zero Lower\nBound,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity (Washington: Brookings Institution).\n\n- 15 -\na faster rise in inflation under the modal outlook. Given the modal outlook envisioned in\nFOMC participants’ recent forecasts, with headwinds continuing to diminish, the\nequilibrium real rate rising, and inflation moving back up to 2 percent over the next few\nyears, the risk that the funds rate would need to return to near zero should be declining\nappreciably. Consistent with this assessment, almost all FOMC participants now view\nthe risks to the outlook for real activity as largely balanced, although some also see\ninflation risks as weighted to the downside.\nThat said, it is sobering to note that many market participants appear to assess the\nrisks to the outlook quite differently. For example, respondents to the Survey of Primary\nDealers in late January thought there was a 20 percent probability that, after liftoff, the\nfunds rate would fall back to zero sometime at or before late 2017.13 In addition, both the\nremarkably low level of long-term government bond yields in advanced economies and\nthe low prevailing level of inflation compensation suggest that financial market\nparticipants may hold more pessimistic views than FOMC participants concerning the\nrisks to the global outlook. Since long-term yields reflect the market’s probability-\nweighted average of all possible short-term interest rate paths, along with compensating\nterm and risk premiums, the generally low level of yields in advanced economies\nsuggests that investors place considerable odds on adverse scenarios that would\nnecessitate a lower and flatter trajectory of the federal funds than envisioned in\nparticipants’ modal SEP projections.14\n13 See Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Markets Group (2015), Responses to Survey of Primary Dealers\n(New York: FRBNY, January), www.newyorkfed.org/markets/survey/2015/January-result.pdf.\n14 Of course, low long-term yields in the United States may not reflect investor pessimism about U.S.\neconomic prospects but instead an expectation that weak economic performance abroad may result in\npersistent upward pressure on the dollar, thereby putting downward pressure on U.S. net exports,\nemployment, inflation, and thus short-term interest rates. On a closely related issue concerning evidence\nthat investors’ perceptions of the likelihood of high inflation versus low inflation have shifted noticeably in\n\n- 16 -\nA final argument for gradually adjusting policy relates to the desirability of\nachieving a prompt return of inflation to the FOMC’s 2 percent goal, an objective that\nwould be advanced by allowing the unemployment rate to decline for a time somewhat\nbelow estimates of its longer-run sustainable level. To a limited degree, such an outcome\nis envisioned in many participants’ most recent SEP projections. A tight labor market\nmay also work to reverse some of the adverse supply-side developments resulting from\nthe financial crisis. The deep recession and slow recovery likely have held back\ninvestment in physical and human capital, restrained the rate of new business formation,\nprompted discouraged workers to leave the labor force, and eroded the skills of the long-\nterm unemployed.15 Some of these effects might be reversed in a tight labor market,\nyielding long-term benefits associated with a more productive economy. That said, the\nquantitative importance of these supply-side mechanisms are difficult to establish, and\nthe relevant research on this point is quite limited.\nOf course, taking a gradualist approach is not without risks. Proceeding too\nslowly to tighten policy could have adverse consequences for the attainment of the\nCommittee’s inflation objective over time, especially if it were to undermine the FOMC’s\ninflation credibility. Inflation could, for example, exhibit nonlinear dynamics in which\nhigh levels of unemployment place relatively little downward pressure on inflation, but\ntight labor markets generate marked upward pressure. If so, a decline in unemployment\nrecent months, see Justin Wolfers (2015), “A Prediction Market for Inflation, or Deflation,” The Upshot,\nNew York Times, March 6.

Yellen\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“A Trans-Atlantic Agenda for Shared Prosperity”\nA Conference Sponsored by the AFL-CIO, Friedrich Ebert Stiftung,\nand the IMK Macroeconomic Policy Institute\nWashington, D.C.\nFebruary 11, 2013\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak to you today about the Federal Reserve’s\nefforts to strengthen the recovery and pursue a goal that it shares with the labor\nmovement: maximum employment.1\nAs an objective of public policy, maximum employment doesn’t appear in the\nU.S. Constitution, in any presidential decree, or even in the mission statement of the\nLabor Department. A law passed in 1946 made it a general goal for the U.S. government,\nbut so far the Federal Reserve is the only agency assigned the job of pursuing maximum\nemployment. The 1977 law spelling out that responsibility also assigned the goal of\nstable prices, and we call this combination of objectives the Federal Reserve’s dual\nmandate.2\nWith so many people today unable to find work, it might seem odd to highlight\nsuch an ambitious and distant goal for employment. I do so because the gulf between\nmaximum employment and the very difficult conditions workers face today helps explain\nthe urgency behind the Federal Reserve’s ongoing efforts to strengthen the recovery. My\ncolleagues and I are acutely aware of how much workers have lost in the past five years.\nIn response, we have taken, and are continuing to take, forceful action to increase the\npace of economic growth and job creation.\nIn the three years after the Great Recession ended, growth in real gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) averaged only 2.2 percent per year. In the same span of time following\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve\nSystem. I am indebted to members of the Board staff--John Maggs, Karen Pence, Jeremy Rudd, and\nWilliam Wascher--who contributed to the preparation of these remarks, and to Board staff members Sejla\nKaralic and Christopher Nekarda for assistance with the exhibits.\n2 The law calls on the Federal Reserve to “promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable\nprices, and moderate long-term interest rates.” See section 2A of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C.\n§ 225a as added by act of Nov. 16, 1977 (91 Stat. 1387) and amended by acts of Oct. 27, 1978 (92 Stat.\n1897); Aug. 23, 1988 (102 Stat. 1375); and Dec. 27, 2000 (114 Stat. 3028)).\n\n- 2 -\nthe previous 10 U.S. recessions, real GDP grew, on average, more than twice as fast--at a\n4.6 percent annual rate.3 So, why has the economy’s recovery from the Great Recession\nbeen so weak?\nThe slow recovery was preceded, of course, by the deepest recession since the end\nof the Second World War. The bursting of an unprecedented housing bubble, together\nwith the financial crisis that followed, dealt a huge blow to demand. These developments\nrobbed homeowners of wealth built over a generation, impaired their access to credit,\ndecimated retirement savings, and shattered the confidence of consumers. Businesses\nslashed capital spending and payrolls, and real GDP contracted by 4.7 percent, more than\ntwice the average for the 10 other recessions since World War II. The Great Recession\nwas also the longest postwar recession--it lasted 18 months, compared with an average of\n10 months for the others.\nThe experience of the United States and other advanced economies suggests that\ndeeper recessions are usually followed by stronger-than-average recoveries. While it’s\nalso true that longer recessions tend to result in weaker recoveries, even after accounting\nfor this factor, this recovery has been significantly weaker than past experience would\nhave predicted.\nThe dashed line in exhibit 1 shows how real GDP would have been expected to\nincrease in this recovery, based on the experience of the United States and other\nadvanced economies and given the depth and duration of the Great Recession.4 The gap\n3 The average for other postwar recoveries would be even higher if one were to exclude the three-year\nperiods following the 1957-58 and 1980 recessions, which included at least part of subsequent recessions.\n4 The results in the figure are derived from a model that relates GDP growth in recoveries to recession\ndepth and duration. See Greg Howard, Robert Martin, and Beth Anne Wilson (2011), “Are Recoveries\nfrom Banking and Financial Crises Really So Different?” International Finance Discussion Papers 1037\n\n- 3 -\nbetween the actual and the predicted path of real output gives a sense of how much\neconomic performance has lagged in this recovery. But the implications of this result\nmay seem a little abstract, so let me illustrate the same idea in a way that tries to show the\nburden that workers continue to bear in this slow recovery.\nExhibit 2 shows how employment has declined and recovered following several\nprevious recessions. The employment measure attempts to control for the fact that\ndemographic changes and other factors have altered the trend, or potential, workforce\nover the years. For example, in the 1970s, the pool of potential workers was expanding\nas baby boomers and an increasing share of women moved into the labor force, such that\nemployment needed to rise relatively quickly just to absorb these additional workers.\nMore recently, the aging of the population has put downward pressure on labor force\nparticipation, so employment hasn’t had to grow as quickly to keep pace with the\npotential workforce.\nEven after making this adjustment, however, the Great Recession stands out both\nfor the magnitude of the job losses that attended the downturn and for the weak recovery\nin employment that occurred after the recession ended.\nIn trying to account for why this recovery has been so weak, it is helpful to first\nconsider several important factors that have in the past supported most economic\nrecoveries. By this I don’t mean everything that contributes to economic growth, but\nrather those things that typically play a key role when the U.S. economy is recovering\nfrom recession. Think of these as the tailwinds that usually promote a recovery.\n(Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, November),\nwww.federalreserve.gov/pubs/ifdp/2011/1037/default.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nThe first tailwind I’ll mention is fiscal policy. History shows that fiscal policy\noften helps to support an economic recovery. Some of this fiscal stimulus is automatic,\nand intended to be. The income loss that individuals and businesses suffer in a recession\nis partly offset when their tax bills fall as well. Government spending on unemployment\nbenefits and other safety-net programs rises in recessions, helping individuals hurt by the\ndownturn and also supporting consumer spending and the broader economy by replacing\nlost income. These automatic declines in tax collections and increases in government\nspending are often supplemented with discretionary fiscal action--tax rate cuts, spending\non infrastructure and other goods and services, and extended unemployment benefits.\nThese discretionary fiscal policy actions are typically a plus for growth in the years just\nafter a recession. For example, following the severe 1981-82 recession, discretionary\nfiscal policy contributed an average of about 1 percentage point per year to real GDP\ngrowth over the subsequent three years.5\nHowever, discretionary fiscal policy hasn’t been much of a tailwind during this\nrecovery. In the year following the end of the recession, discretionary fiscal policy at the\nfederal, state, and local levels boosted growth at roughly the same pace as in past\nrecoveries, as exhibit 3 indicates. But instead of contributing to growth thereafter,\ndiscretionary fiscal policy this time has actually acted to restrain the recovery. State and\nlocal governments were cutting spending and, in some cases, raising taxes for much of\nthis period to deal with revenue shortfalls. At the federal level, policymakers have\n5 These calculations are based on Federal Reserve Board estimates of fiscal impetus, which measures the\nboost to aggregate demand from increased government purchases as well as the effects of changes in tax\nand entitlement policies on consumer and business spending. See Glenn Follette and Byron Lutz (2010),\n“Fiscal Policy in the United States: Automatic Stabilizers, Discretionary Fiscal Policy Actions, and the\nEconomy,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2010-43 (Washington: Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System, June), www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2010/201043/201043abs.html.\n\n- 5 -\nreduced purchases of goods and services, allowed stimulus-related spending to decline,\nand have put in place further policy actions to reduce deficits. I was relieved that the\nCongress and the Administration were able to reach agreement on avoiding the full force\nof the “fiscal cliff” that was due to take effect on January 1. While a long-term plan is\nneeded to reduce deficits and slow the growth of federal debt, the tax increases and\nspending cuts that would have occurred last month, absent action by the Congress and the\nPresident, likely would have been a headwind strong enough to blow the United States\nback into recession. Negotiations continue over the extent of spending cuts now due to\ntake effect beginning in March, and I expect that discretionary fiscal policy will continue\nto be a headwind for the recovery for some time, instead of the tailwind it has been in the\npast.\nA second tailwind in most recoveries is housing. Residential investment creates\njobs in construction and related industries. Before the Great Recession, housing\ninvestment added an average of 1/2 percentage point to real GDP growth in the two years\nafter each of the previous four recessions, considerably more than its contribution to\ngrowth at other times.6\nDuring this recovery, in contrast, residential investment, on net, has contributed\nvery little to growth since the recession ended. The reasons are easy to understand, given\nthe central role that housing played in the Great Recession. Following an extended boom\nin construction driven in large part by overly loose mortgage lending standards and\nunrealistic expectations for future home price increases, the housing market collapsed--\n6 See Michael W. McCracken (2011), “Housing’s Role in a Recovery,” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis,\nEconomic Synopses, no. 6 (February), pp. 1-2, http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/es/11/ES1106.pdf.\n\n- 6 -\nsales and prices plunged and mortgage credit was sharply curtailed. Tight mortgage\ncredit conditions are continuing to make it difficult for many families to buy homes,\ndespite record-low mortgage interest rates that have helped make housing very\naffordable. I’m encouraged by recent improvement in the residential sector, but the\ncontribution of housing investment to overall economic activity remains considerably\nbelow the average seen in past recoveries, as exhibit 4 shows.\nBeyond the direct effects on residential investment, the extraordinary collapse in\nhouse prices resulted in a huge loss of household wealth--at last count, net home equity is\nstill down 40 percent, or about $5 trillion, from 2005.7 This loss of wealth has weighed\non the finances and spending of many homeowners. Households are less able to tap their\nhome equity to deal with economic shocks, fund their children’s education, or start new\nbusinesses. For some households, the collapse in house prices has left them underwater\non their mortgages, and thus less able to refinance or sell their homes.\nAnother important tailwind in most economic recoveries is one that tends to be\ntaken for granted--the faith most of us have, based on history and personal experience,\nthat recessions are temporary and that the economy will soon get back to normal. Even\nduring recessions, households’ expectations for income growth tend to be reasonably\nstable, which provides support for overall spending. In the most recent recession,\nhowever, surveys suggest that consumers sharply revised down their prospects for future\nincome growth and have only partially adjusted up their expectations since then\n(exhibit 5).\n7 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Statistical Release Z.1, “Flow of Funds Accounts\nof the United States,” table B.100, line 49 (Owners’ Equity in Household Real Estate), available at\nwww.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1.\n\n- 7 -\nThe recovery has also encountered some unusual headwinds. The fiscal and\nfinancial crisis in Europe has resulted in a euro-area recession and contributed to slower\nglobal growth. Europe’s difficulties have blunted what had been strong growth in U.S.\nexports earlier in the recovery by sapping demand worldwide.\nLet me say a few words now, and more later, about the role of monetary policy in\nthis recovery. The Federal Reserve typically plays a large role in promoting recoveries\nby reducing the federal funds rate and keeping it low until the economy is again on a\nsolid footing. Reducing the federal funds rate tends to reduce other interest rates and\nboost asset prices, thus encouraging spending and investment throughout the economy.\nAs it has before, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in 2007 started\nreducing the federal funds rate at the first signs of economic weakness and made sharper\nrate cuts as the recession deepened. As in some past recoveries that were disappointingly\nslow, the FOMC has kept rates low well after the end of the recession.\nBut unlike the past, by December 2008 the Committee had reduced the federal\nfunds rate effectively to zero. Because that rate, for practical purposes, cannot be cut\nfurther, this level is referred to as the effective lower bound. Without the option of using\nits conventional policy tool, and with the recession getting worse, the FOMC decided to\nemploy unconventional tools to further ease monetary policy, even though the efficacy of\nthese tools was uncertain and it was recognized that their use might carry some potential\ncosts. The better known of these tools is the purchase of large amounts of longer-term\ngovernment securities, which is commonly referred to as quantitative easing. The other\nunconventional tool is known as forward guidance--providing information about the\nfuture path of short-term interest rates anticipated by the Committee. Both of these\n\n- 8 -\napproaches are intended to address a gap caused by the effective lower bound. This gap\nis the shortfall between what the FOMC likely would do in current economic\ncircumstances, were it able to reduce the federal funds rate below zero, and the reality\nthat the rate can’t be cut further.\nI believe that the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases and other unconventional\npolicy actions have helped, and are continuing to help, fill this gap and thus shore up\naggregate demand. The evidence suggests that the FOMC’s actions have lowered short-\nand longer-term private borrowing rates and boosted asset prices.8 However, while this\ncontribution has been significant, lower interest rates may be doing less to increase\nspending than in past recoveries because of some unusual features of the Great Recession\nand the current recovery. For example, as I noted, the housing crisis left many\nhomeowners with high loan-to-value ratios and damaged credit records, creating barriers\nto their access to credit, while the financial crisis led many banks to lend only to\nborrowers with higher credit scores. As a consequence, the proportion of households that\nhave been able to take advantage of declining rates to refinance their mortgages or to\nborrow to purchase new homes has probably been lower than in past recoveries. In\naddition, pronounced uncertainty about economic conditions has weighed on capital\nspending decisions and may have blunted the normal effect of lower interest rates on\nbusiness investment.\n8 See Ben S. Bernanke (2012), “Monetary Policy since the Onset of the Crisis,” speech delivered at “The\nChanging Policy Landscape,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in\nJackson Hole, Wyo., August 30-September 1,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20120831a.htm.\n\n- 9 -\nThese are the major reasons why I believe this recovery has been so slow. After a\nlengthy recession that imposed great hardships on American workers, the weak recovery\nhas made the past five years the toughest that many of today’s workers have ever\nexperienced.\nThe unemployment rate now stands at 7.9 percent. To put this number in\nperspective, while that’s a big improvement from the 10 percent reached in late 2009, it is\nnow higher than unemployment ever got in the 24 years before the Great Recession.\nMoreover, the government’s current estimate of 12 million unemployed doesn’t include\n800,000 discouraged workers who say they have given up looking for work. And, as\nexhibit 6 shows, 8 million people, or 5.6 percent of the workforce, say they are working\npart time even though they would prefer a full-time job. A broader measure of\nunderemployment that includes these and other potential workers stands at 14.4 percent.\nThe effects of the recession and the subsequent slow recovery have been harshest\non some of the most vulnerable Americans. The poverty rate has risen sharply since the\nonset of the recession, after a decade in which it had been relatively stable, and stands at\n15 percent of the population, significantly above the average of the past three decades.9\nEven those today who are fortunate enough to hold jobs have seen their hourly\ncompensation barely keep pace with the cost of living over the past three years, while\nlabor’s share of income--as measured by the percent of production by nonfinancial\ncorporations accruing to workers as compensation--remains near the postwar low reached\nin 2011 (exhibit 7). Compared with the 7.9 percent unemployment rate for all workers,\nthe unemployment rate for African Americans is 13.8 percent. The unemployment rate\n9 Mean annual poverty rate for all people, U.S. Bureau of the Census.\n\n- 10 -\nfor those without a high school diploma is 12 percent. For young people--workers 16 to\n19 years old--the unemployment rate is 23.4 percent, little changed from the end of the\nrecession. Among African Americans in that age group, 38 percent of those in the labor\nforce can’t find a job.\nAnother gauge of the effect that this slow recovery has had on workers is how\nlong it is taking to find a job. At its worst point in the 1980s, the median length of\nunemployment for those looking for a job was 12 weeks, but the median since the Great\nRecession has averaged 20 weeks and now stands at 16 weeks. Three million Americans\nhave been looking for work for one year or more; that’s one-fourth of all unemployed\nworkers, which is down from 2011’s peak but far larger than was seen before the Great\nRecession.\nThese are not just statistics to me. We know that long-term unemployment is\ndevastating to workers and their families. Longer spells of unemployment raise the risk\nof homelessness and have been a factor contributing to the foreclosure crisis. When\nyou’re unemployed for six months or a year, it is hard to qualify for a lease, so even the\noption of relocating to find a job is often off the table. The toll is simply terrible on the\nmental and physical health of workers, on their marriages, and on their children.10\nLong-term unemployment is also a great concern because it has the potential to\nitself become a headwind restraining the economy. Individuals out of work for an\nextended period can become less employable as they lose the specific skills acquired in\ntheir previous jobs and also lose the habits needed to hold down any job. Those out of\n10 See Steven J. Davis and Till Von Wachter (2011), “Recessions and the Costs of Job Loss,” Brookings\nPapers on Economic Activity, Fall, pp. 1-72.\n\n- 11 -\nwork for a long time also tend to lose touch with former co-workers in their previous\nindustry or occupation--contacts that can often help an unemployed worker find a job.\nLong-term unemployment can make any worker progressively less employable, even\nafter the economy strengthens.\nA factor contributing to the high level of long-term unemployment in the current\nrecovery is the relatively large proportion of workers who have permanently lost their\nprevious jobs, as opposed to being laid off temporarily. For example, in past recessions,\na considerable share of jobs lost in construction has been temporary, but that isn’t the\ncase this time. Construction employment fell from its peak of 7.7 million in 2006 to a\nlow of 5.4 million in 2011. Only about 300,000 of those 2.3 million jobs have returned\nand most won’t, at least for many years.\nIn general, individuals who permanently lose their previous jobs take longer to\nbecome reemployed than do those on temporary layoff, are more likely to have to change\nindustries or occupations to find a new job, and earn significantly less when they become\nreemployed.11\nThe greater amount of permanent job loss seen in the recent recession also\nsuggests that there might have been an increase in the degree of mismatch between the\nskills possessed by the unemployed and those demanded by employers. This possibility\nand the unprecedented level and persistence of long-term unemployment in this recovery\nhave prompted some to ask whether a significant share of unemployment since the\nrecession is due to structural problems in labor markets and not simply a cyclical\n11 See Louis S. Jacobson, Robert J. LaLonde, and Daniel G. Sullivan (1993), “Earnings Losses of Displaced\nWorkers,” American Economic Review, vol. 83 (September), pp. 685-709.\n\n- 12 -\nshortfall in aggregate demand. This question is important for anyone committed to the\ngoal of maximum employment, because it implicitly asks whether the best we can hope\nfor, even in a healthy economy, is an unemployment rate significantly higher than what\nhas been achieved in the past.\nFor the Federal Reserve, the answer to this question has important implications\nfor monetary policy. If the current, elevated rate of unemployment is largely cyclical,\nthen the straightforward solution is to take action to raise aggregate demand. If\nunemployment is instead substantially structural, some worry that attempts to raise\naggregate demand will have little effect on unemployment and serve only to stoke\ninflation.\nThis question is frequently discussed by the FOMC.12 I cannot speak for the\nCommittee or my colleagues, some of whom have publicly related their own conclusions\non this topic. However, I see the evidence as consistent with the view that the increase in\nunemployment since the onset of the Great Recession has been largely cyclical and not\nstructural.\nFor example, the rise in unemployment during the recession was accompanied by\na dramatic decline in job vacancies and was widespread across industry and occupation\ngroups. Job losses in the construction and financial services industries were particularly\n12 See, for example, the minutes of several recent FOMC meetings held on December 11-12, 2012;\nSeptember 12-13, 2012; and July 31-August 1, 2012: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n(2013), “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, December 11-12, 2012,” press release,\nJanuary 3, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20130103a.htm; Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System (2012), “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, September 12-13,\n2012,” press release, October 4, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20121004a.htm; and\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012), “Minutes of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee, July 31-August 1, 2012,” press release, August 22,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20120822a.htm.\n\n- 13 -\nlarge--hardly surprising given the collapse in these sectors in 2008 and 2009--but\nmanufacturing and other cyclically sensitive industries were hit hard as well, and\nemployment in these industries has likewise recovered slowly. Moreover, if skills\nmismatch in the labor market has led to an excess supply of workers in some sectors and\na shortage of workers in others, then we would expect to see an atypical amount of\nvariation in the balance between job openings and unemployment across sectors. Based\non this insight, researchers Ed Lazear and Jim Spletzer constructed quantitative measures\nof mismatch across industries and occupations.13 They found that their mismatch indexes\nwere indeed elevated at the end of the Great Recession, as exhibit 8 shows. But these\nmeasures have fallen over the course of the recovery to near pre-recession levels. In\naddition, widespread mismatch between job vacancies and workers across different\nsectors might be expected to cause wage rates to rise relatively quickly in sectors with\nmany job openings and relatively slowly in sectors with an excess supply of available\nworkers. But work by Jesse Rothstein fails to uncover evidence of such a pattern.14\nThis and related research suggests to me, first, that a broad-based cyclical\nshortage of demand is the main cause of today’s elevated unemployment rate, and,\nsecond, that whatever problems there may be today with labor market functioning are\nlikely to be substantially resolved as the broader economy improves and bolsters the\ndemand for labor.\n13 See Edward P. Lazear and James R. Spletzer (2012), “The United States Labor Market: Status Quo or a\nNew Normal?” NBER Working Paper Series 18386 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic\nResearch, September). See also Ayșegül Șahin, Joseph Song, Giorgio Topa, and Giovanni L. Violante\n(2012), “Mismatch Unemployment,” NBER Working Paper Series 18265 (Cambridge, Mass.: National\nBureau of Economic Research, August).\n14 See Jesse Rothstein (2012), “The Labor Market Four Years into the Crisis: Assessing Structural\nExplanations,” Industrial and Labor Relations Review, vol. 65 (July), pp. 467-500.\n\n- 14 -\nI don’t mean to suggest that there aren’t some workers who have been stranded by\nstructural changes in the economy. More can and should be done to help dislocated\nworkers acquire new skills to transition from industries and occupations with fewer\nopportunities. But making this transition will be much easier in a healthy economy,\nwhich is one reason why I am encouraged by the evidence that elevated unemployment is\nindeed largely cyclical. I will now describe what the Federal Reserve is doing to try to\nraise demand and create jobs.\nI have described the two unconventional policy tools that the FOMC has\nemployed since it reduced the target federal funds rate in 2008 to its effective lower\nbound. The first is large-scale asset purchases, intended to lower long-term interest rates\nto encourage borrowing for spending and investment. Between 2008 and mid-2011, the\nFOMC purchased agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (MBS), agency debt,\nand Treasury securities totaling $2.3 trillion. In 2011, the FOMC began the maturity\nextension program, under which it reduced its holdings of short-term Treasury securities\nand used the proceeds to purchase an equivalent amount of longer-term Treasury\nsecurities.\nHowever, as the scheduled endpoint of that program approached, it became clear\nthat the economy remained weak, and the FOMC took a series of steps to provide further\nimpetus to the recovery. In June 2012, the Committee extended its maturity extension\nprogram until the end of the year. Then in September, it made a major new commitment\nto asset purchases. Unlike its past purchase programs, which were fixed in size, this time\nthe FOMC stated its determination to continue the program, provided that inflation\nremains well contained, until it judges that there has been a substantial improvement in\n\n- 15 -\nthe outlook for the labor market. The Committee currently intends to purchase MBS and\nTreasury debt at a pace that will add about $85 billion per month of such securities to the\nFederal Reserve’s balance sheet. In determining the size, pace, and composition of these\npurchases over time, the Committee will also take into account ongoing assessments of\ntheir efficacy and costs.\nThe second unconventional policy tool that the FOMC has used is forward\nguidance, in the form of more-explicit and more-detailed information about the future\npath of monetary policy. The longer-term interest rates that most profoundly influence\nhousing demand, capital spending, and asset prices depend on current and expected\nfuture levels of short-term interest rates, such as the federal funds rate that has been the\nFed’s conventional monetary policy tool. Signaling the future path of the federal funds\nrate can therefore directly affect interest rates today on auto loans, home mortgages, and\nbonds issued by companies and state and local governments, even when the current level\nof the federal funds rate cannot be lowered.\nThe FOMC has substantially expanded its forward guidance in recent years. In\n2009, the Committee stated that economic conditions “are likely to warrant exceptionally\nlow levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.”15 In 2011, the FOMC said\nthis period would likely last “at least through mid-2013,” and extended this date guidance\nseveral times.16\n15 For example, see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2009), “FOMC Statement,” press\nrelease, March 18, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20090318a.htm.\n16 For example, see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2011), “FOMC Statement,” press\nrelease, August 9, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20110809a.htm.\n\n- 16 -\nA disadvantage of this calendar-based approach was that it might not be clear\nwhether changes in the date reflect changes in the FOMC’s outlook for growth, for\ninflation, or a shift in the desired stance of policy. In December 2012, the FOMC\ntherefore replaced the date with greater detail on the economic conditions that would\nwarrant maintaining the federal funds rate at its present, exceptionally low level.\nSpecifically, it stated that near-zero rates would likely remain appropriate for a\nconsiderable time after the asset purchase program ends and “at least as long as the\nunemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years\nahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s\n2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well\nanchored.”17\nIt deserves emphasis that a 6-1/2 percent unemployment rate and inflation one to\ntwo years ahead that is 1/2 percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent objective\nare thresholds for possible action, not triggers that will necessarily prompt an immediate\nincrease in the FOMC’s target rate. In practical terms, it means that the Committee does\nnot expect to raise the federal funds rate as long as unemployment remains above\n6-1/2 percent and inflation one to two years ahead is projected to be less than\n1/2 percentage point above its 2 percent objective. When one of these thresholds is\ncrossed, action is possible but not assured.\nMoreover, these thresholds for possible action do not reflect any change in the\nCommittee’s longer-run goals. With respect to maximum employment, most FOMC\n17 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012), “FOMC Statement,” press release,\nDecember 12, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20121212a.htm.\n\n- 17 -\nparticipants continue to estimate that the longer-run normal unemployment rate lies in a\nrange of 5.2 to 6 percent, and the Committee continues to believe an inflation rate of\n2 percent (as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption\nexpenditures) is most consistent with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate. Indeed, the\nCommittee reaffirmed these longer-run goals, first adopted in January 2012, just last\nmonth.18 Of course, our control over the economy is imperfect, and so temporary\ndeviations from the FOMC’s specific longer-term goals will sometimes occur.\nImportantly, these quantitative goals are neither ceilings nor floors for inflation and\nunemployment, and the Committee will take a balanced approach to returning both\nmeasures to their objectives over time.\nI believe the policy steps we have taken recently are in accord with this balanced\napproach. With employment so far from its maximum level and with inflation currently\nrunning, and expected to continue to run, at or below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-\nterm objective, it is entirely appropriate for progress in attaining maximum employment\nto take center stage in determining the Committee’s policy stance.\nWhile the Committee’s longer-term goals remain unchanged, what has changed is\nthat the FOMC is now providing more information about how it expects to pursue its\ninflation and employment goals. In particular, we will employ our policy tools, as\nappropriate, to raise aggregate demand and employment in the context of continued price\nstability, consistent with our balanced approach. That’s good news for workers, because\nI believe that these steps will increase demand, and more demand means more jobs.\n18 The FOMC’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, as amended effective on\nJanuary 29, 2013, is available on the Board’s website at\nwww.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/longer-run-goals-and-policy-strategy-20130130.pdf.\n\n- 18 -\nIt will be a long road back to a healthy job market. It will be years before many\nworkers feel like they have regained the ground lost since 2007. Longer-term trends,\nsuch as globalization and technological change, will continue to pose challenges to\nworkers in many industries.\nLet me close with some words of encouragement. The job market is improving.\nThe progress has been too slow, but there is progress. My colleagues and I at the Federal\nReserve are well aware of the difficulties faced by workers in this slow recovery, and\nwe’re actively engaged in continuing efforts to promote a stronger economy, more jobs,\nand better conditions for all workers.\nThank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.\n\nExhibit 1: Predicted and Actual Recovery in U.S. Real GDP\nIndex, NBER trough = 100\n114 114\nActual\nPrediction\n112 112\n110 110\n108 108\n106 106\n104 104\n102 102\n100 100\n98 98\n- 3 years 1 9 9 7 1 9 9 8 1 9 9 9 Trough 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 1 2 0 0 2 3 years 2003\nNote: Prediction based on depth and duration of 2007-09 recession in the United States using a regression model for advanced economies since the 1970s.

    "text": "Speech to the Greenlining Institute’s 14th Annual Economic Development Summit\nLos Angeles, California\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery April 19, 2007, 12:50 PM Pacific, 3:50 PM Eastern\nCommunity Development: Opportunities in Low-income and Minority Communities\nGood afternoon, everyone. I’m Janet Yellen, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve\nBank of San Francisco. I would like to thank Greenlining for inviting me to speak at this year’s\nEconomic Summit. Before I begin, I would just like to add my own words of congratulations to\nLuis Arteaga, Erin Pak, and Cory Jasperson. It is heartening to see their commitment to\nimproving the well-being of low-income and minority communities, as well as to hear about the\nrange of innovative strategies and programs that are needed to accomplish lasting change.\nIn my remarks today, I would like to speak to the theme of this year’s summit, “seizing\nthe opportunity.” The focus on opportunity is an important one. Since its inception, Greenlining\nhas worked to reframe how financial institutions view low-income and minority communities,\narguing--often passionately--that these markets represent a true business opportunity and not just\na regulatory obligation.\nThis emphasis on “opportunity” mirrors a broader shift in the field of community\ndevelopment as a whole. Slowly—and perhaps not yet universally—community development\nstrategies are evolving to focus on community assets rather than on community needs. In other\nwords, instead of framing a neighborhood by its problems, such as high crime rates or\ndisinvestment, the community development field has begun to emphasize the sometimes hidden\nassets of low-income neighborhoods, such as the market potential and untapped purchasing\npower of inner city residents, historical architecture, unique small businesses, and talented local\nentrepreneurs. As Chairman Bernanke noted in his Greenlining speech last year, quantifying\nthese assets and helping investors become aware of the opportunities in underserved\nneighborhoods can help to enlist market forces in the service of community development.1\nHow is this focus on community assets different from community development efforts\nthirty years ago? Since I don’t have time today to go into a detailed history of community\n1\nChairman Ben S. Bernanke (2006). “By the Numbers: Data and Measurement in Community Economic\nDevelopment,” speech to the Greenlining Institute's Thirteenth Annual Economic Development Summit, Los\nAngeles, California (via satellite) , April 20, 2006.\n\ndevelopment, let me just illustrate how this shift in thinking can spur very different models of\ninner city revitalization.\nAs many of you know, downtown Los Angeles has undergone an incredible\ntransformation over the past eight years. What you might not know, however, is that where we\nstand today—the Bonaventure Hotel— is located within the Bunker Hill redevelopment area2,\nthe site of one of the largest urban renewal projects in the country’s history. Once the home of\nthe very rich, Bunker Hill fell into decline in the 1920s and 30s, and the neighborhood’s elegant\nmansions were converted into apartments to house low-income families. By the 1940s, 99\npercent of the units in Bunker Hill were tenant occupied, many without running water, and the\nincidence of crime and disease in the neighborhood was among the worst of any area in Los\nAngeles.3 By 1955—after several attempts to attract private investment failed—Los Angeles\ncity planners were convinced that only a massive infusion of federal dollars and an ambitious\ntop-down redevelopment strategy would be able to reverse the decline. The solution to the\nproblem of Bunker Hill was to remove it. Once the redevelopment plans were in place, the\nChairman of the Community Redevelopment Agency boasted, “The Bunker Hill redevelopment\nproject promises to become one of the biggest and most important slum clearance projects in the\nWest.” 4 It took thirty years—and for much of this time the land stood vacant—for the\nCommunity Redevelopment Agency to develop L.A.’s commercial downtown, including the\nUnion Bank building, the Pacific Telephone and Telegraphic building, California Plaza, and the\nBonaventure Hotel.\nUrban renewal in Los Angeles did transform dowtown L.A., and ultimately contributed\nto higher property values in the city. But, in hindsight, it also incurred significant costs. More\nthan 7,000 families were displaced as their homes were destroyed to make way for commercial\nredevelopment in the area. Moreover, these commercial buildings were not enough to create a\nnew vibrant neighborhood or stem the flight of businesses and families from the inner city. By\nthe mid-1990s, downtown Los Angeles faced high office vacancy rates, problems with poverty\nand homelessness, and deserted streets at night.\n2 For maps and information about the Community Redevelopment Agency of the City of Los Angeles project areas,\nincluding Bunker Hill, visit http://www.crala.org/internet-site/Projects/index.cfm.\n3 Mara A. Marks (2004). “Shifting Ground: The Rise and Fall of the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment\nAgency,” Southern California Quarterly 86(3), p. 247.\n4 Ibid., p. 261.\n\nIn contrast to this top-down approach, the current transformation of downtown Los\nAngeles is driven from the bottom up—by local government working with the private sector,\nresidents, nonprofits, and local entrepreneurs--all of whom are empowered by new resources to\ncapitalize on their ideas and unlock the economic potential of this community. For example,\nrather than tearing down the old commercial buildings, this strategy relies on infill development\nand the adaptive reuse of historic buildings for new housing units. Investors are supporting local\nentrepreneurs and providing private equity to inner city businesses. Nonprofit organizations and\ncommunity development financial institutions are helping to incubate new businesses by\nproviding technical assistance and small business loans to low-income and minority\nentrepreneurs.\nEqually notable are local efforts to ensure that downtown residents benefit from these\ninvestments. The Staples Center Community Benefits Agreement sets an important precedent for\nhow local government, private developers, and community groups can work together to promote\nequitable development. Among other features, the Agreement ensures that 20 percent of new\nhousing units in the project area will be affordable to low-income households, and stipulates that\n70 percent of the jobs at the new center pay a living wage. The Agreement also provides for\npreferential hiring treatment to local and displaced residents.5\nWhile these two different vignettes greatly over-simplify the complex realities of\nredevelopment, I hope that this brief exercise in “comparing and contrasting” does illustrate how\nmuch the model of inner city revitalization has changed over the last 30 years. It also points to\nhow much the financing of community development has changed. Whereas early efforts at urban\nrenewal were funded largely by centralized federal grants, today’s community development\nprojects are more likely to be financed by a combination of public and private dollars. The Low\nIncome Housing and New Markets Tax Credit programs, for example, both reflect a shift in the\nfederal government’s role in community development. Instead of providing funds directly to\nneighborhoods, these programs encourage private investment by offsetting risk through tax\nincentives. The community development finance field has also become extremely innovative in\nthe way it secures both equity and debt financing, and has brought a much wider range of\ninvestors, lenders, and funders to the table. Today, you have government investing alongside\n5 For more information about the Community Benefits Agreement along the Figueroa corridor, visit\nhttp://www.saje.net/site/c.hkLQJcMUKrH/b.2315801/k.9080/Figueroa_Corridor_Coalition.htm.\n\nbanks, pension funds, and venture capitalists, all looking at ways to develop the assets that are\npresent but underutilized in low-income neighborhoods.\nDespite these innovations in community development finance and the shift to a “bottom-\nup” strategy, the lessons from the past should also caution us against thinking that the road ahead\nwill be easy. While these new approaches hold much promise, Los Angeles must still contend\nwith difficult issues such as homelessness, education, workforce training, and additional\naffordable housing for low- and moderate-income families. Substantial gaps in access to credit\nand capital also remain. To provide just one example, research studies suggest that minority-\nowned small businesses have a harder time getting access to credit than other businesses, even\nafter controlling for a wide variety of factors related to creditworthiness.6 Finding new ways to\nhelp connect capital with viable investment opportunities in these underserved markets is critical\nfor an asset-based approach to community development to work. At the San Francisco Fed, the\nCenter for Community Development Investments is conducting research and holding\nconferences to explore ways to improve access to capital for community development, for\nexample, by securitizing community development loans, expanding the availability of\ncommunity development venture capital, and overcoming information barriers to investment in\nemerging domestic markets like downtown L.A.\nIn bringing my remarks to a close, I would like to underscore how important your efforts\nare to the strength of the communities across the country. I encourage you to continue working\ntogether to help provide increased economic opportunity in your communities, and I wish you\nthe best of luck in your efforts. I am confident that the ideas and partnerships that you develop in\nforums like these will help to answer the critical challenges facing the community development\nfield. Thank you.\n# # #\n6 For a review of these studies, see Michael S.

    "text": "Speech to the National Association for Business Economics’ Annual Meeting\nSan Francisco, California\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery September 10, 2007, 8:00 AM Pacific, 11:00 AM Eastern\nRecent Financial Developments and the U.S. Economic Outlook1\nGood morning. It’s my pleasure to welcome you to this beautiful city. I'm\ndelighted that NABE chose to have its national meeting here, and I'm especially pleased\nto have been invited to speak to you today. As some of you may know, I occasionally\nuse colorful language to describe the economy. Certainly, the events in financial markets\nover the past couple of months have generated their share of it. But I believe these are\ntimes when there is particularly great value in speaking deliberately, keeping a cool head,\nconducting careful analyses, and closely monitoring emerging developments. So those\nconsiderations will be reflected in the tenor of my remarks today. I would like to discuss\nrecent events in financial markets, consider their impact on the prospects for the U.S.\neconomy, and offer my perspective on recent Fed policy actions, both in its role in\npromoting stability in financial markets and in its role in the conduct of the nation's\nmonetary policy. I want to emphasize at the outset that these remarks reflect my own\npersonal views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee.\nLet me begin with the financial markets and review some of the recent\ndevelopments I consider to be relevant in evaluating the prospects for the economy going\nforward. Beginning in mid-July, global financial markets became highly volatile and\nincreasingly averse to risk. In the U.S., perhaps the most dramatic illustration of the\n1 I would like to thank San Francisco Fed staff members John Judd and Judith Goff for excellent assistance\nin the preparation of these remarks.\n1\n\nensuing flight to safety was the decline in the three-month Treasury bill rate, which\ndipped by almost 2 percentage points between mid-July and August 20th.\nDramatically wider yield spreads on credit default swaps, which provide\ninsurance against default on the underlying securities, are further evidence of increased\nrisk aversion in financial markets. Indeed, wider spreads are evident for a host of\nunderlying instruments, from mortgages to corporate bonds, with lower-rated instruments\nseeing especially big increases in spreads. At the same time, options-based implied\nvolatilities on a range of assets, from equities to foreign exchange, increased markedly,\nreflecting heightened uncertainty about the future. Since mid-August, Treasury bill rates\nhave partially rebounded and credit default spreads have abated somewhat, but risk\naversion remains notably high. This same turbulence has hit markets abroad, where risk\nspreads and implied volatilities are up, and there has been a significant flight to safety.\nOf greater relevance to monetary policy are movements in the borrowing costs\nfacing households and firms, since it is these interest rates that influence spending\ndecisions and aggregate demand. On the corporate side, prime borrowers have\nexperienced little change in their borrowing costs because higher spreads have been\noffset by lower Treasury rates. Issuers of low-grade corporate bonds with greater credit\nrisk, in contrast, face sharply higher borrowing costs: spreads have widened so much that\nyields are up substantially since mid-July.\nIn the mortgage market, increased aversion to risk has been particularly apparent,\nwith spreads above Treasuries increasing for mortgages of all types. Borrowing rates for\nlow-risk conforming mortgages have actually decreased somewhat. But other mortgage\nrates have risen, including those available to some borrowers with high credit ratings. In\n2\n\nparticular, rates on jumbo mortgages, both fixed- and adjustable-rate, have risen\nnoticeably since mid-July. Rates on home equity loans and lines of credit are also up,\nespecially for those with high loan-to-value ratios.\nOf course, subprime mortgages have become difficult to get at any rate. And that\nreflects another sign of the increased caution of market participants, specifically, sharply\nrestricted credit terms and availability. In the mortgage market, lenders have tightened\ncredit standards, making nonprime and jumbo mortgages available to fewer borrowers.\nFor example, mortgage lenders report raising FICO scores and lowering allowable loan-\nto-value ratios in many mortgage loan programs, and many subprime programs have been\nshut down altogether.\nMoreover, some markets have become downright illiquid; in other words, the\nmarkets themselves are not functioning efficiently, or may not be functioning much at all.\nThis illiquidity has become an enormous problem for companies that specialize in\noriginating mortgages and then bundling them to sell as securities. The markets for\nselling these securities have all but dried up, except for the lowest-risk, “conforming”\nagency mortgages that can be sold to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. And a market where\nmany firms, including financial institutions, get short-term funding is illiquid as well,\nnamely, the market for asset-backed commercial paper—short-term business loans that\nare secured by other assets, often mortgages. With liquidity problems in the markets in\nwhich many mortgage companies both sell assets and borrow, these firms have faced\nserious challenges, and a few have gone out of business.\nDepository institutions also face some illiquidity, specifically in the funding\nmarkets for maturities in the one- to six-month range. Compounding their liquidity\n3\n\nproblems are concerns that mortgages and other assets that are normally securitized may\ncome back onto their balance sheets and that customers may draw on unsecured credit\nlines.\nTo assess how financial conditions relevant to aggregate demand have changed,\nwe must consider not only credit markets but also the markets for equity and foreign\nexchange. These markets have hardly been immune to recent financial turbulence, but\nthe changes since mid-July, on balance, are less dramatic. Broad equity indices are\ndown, but not sharply. And the dollar has changed little on a trade-weighted basis, as\nappreciations against the euro and pound—which may reflect safe-haven demands—have\nbeen offset by a big depreciation against the yen, probably reflecting a withdrawal from\nthe so-called “carry trade” in which investors borrowed at low rates in Japan and lent at\nhigher rates in the U.S.\nAs these financial events have unfolded, many explanations have emerged. I have\nlittle doubt that scholars will study and debate the causes for some time to come. So I\nwill only offer some tentative thoughts on why all of this happened.\nThe ostensible trigger seems to have been concern about growing delinquencies\non subprime mortgages. There are legitimate and serious concerns about the extent to\nwhich subprime delinquencies are traceable to predatory lending practices and a\ndeterioration in underwriting standards over the last few years. However, some of these\ndelinquencies arguably resulted from environmental changes—rising market interest\nrates, as the Fed removed accommodation in the stance of policy, and intensifying\nweakness in housing markets, which slowed or reversed the long-standing trend of\nsignificant house-price appreciation.\n4\n\nIn this new environment, borrowers with variable-rate mortgages have started to\nsee their rates reset much higher than they may have expected, and most borrowers have\nseen their home equity building up much more slowly than expected or even shrinking.\nAmong these are some—many in the subprime category—who were barely able to make\nthe original terms of their mortgages, in part because these loans incorporated features\nlike “piggyback” loans to cover down payments, loans requiring low or no\ndocumentation, interest-only loans, and adjustable-rate loans with the option to make\nreduced payments for a time resulting in negative amortization. For many of these\nborrowers, particularly those who bought homes during 2005 and 2006, the\nenvironmental changes have been enough to push them to delinquency or default.\nWhile the problems with subprime mortgages have understandably received a lot\nof attention, it is important to remember that the whole subprime market itself is only a\nrelatively small part—10 to 15 percent, depending on the exact definition—of the overall\nmortgage market. How, then, could problems in this relatively small market infect so\nmuch of the financial sector, and possibly real economic activity? The answer appears to\nlie in the characteristics of some of the complex financial instruments that have been\ndeveloped as a means to diversify and spread risk. These instruments include not only\nmortgage-backed securities, including subprime mortgages, but also CDOs—\ncollateralized debt obligations that package bonds, including mortgage-backed\nsecurities—and CLOs—collateralized loan obligations that package business loans—and\na variety of associated derivatives, such as credit default swaps and indices based on such\nswaps. These instruments are obviously very complex, which makes them difficult to\nunderstand and evaluate, not only for the average investor, but even for sophisticated\n5\n\ninvestors. In particular, it is difficult to determine the risk embedded in these\ninstruments and how to price them.\nInvestors have relied on a variety of means to assess their exposure to them—\nfrom high-powered mathematical models to agencies that assign ratings to them. But\nmodels are, at best, approximations, and, because these instruments are relatively new,\nthere were not necessarily enough data available to estimate how they would do under the\nstress of a downturn in housing prices or economic activity. As for the rating agencies,\nonce recent developments began to break, they quickly began announcing sharp\ndowngrades, which intensified awareness of the uncertainty surrounding the risk\ncharacteristics of many of these instruments.\nAs delinquencies have risen in the subprime market, the complex instruments\nassociated with those mortgages have come under question. Moreover, questions have\narisen concerning the underwriting standards used by financial firms that received fees to\noriginate and package mortgages for sale rather than holding them for their own account.\nIn consequence, holders of these securities, many highly leveraged, have been forced to\nsell into illiquid markets, realizing prices that are substantially below their model-based\nestimates, or to sell liquid assets as an alternative. Significant losses have been realized\nin the process.\nOnce other investors saw how quickly and unpredictably such markets could\ncease to function well, those who used similar complex instruments likely grew\nconcerned about how quickly and unpredictably their own exposures might change for\nthe worse, leading them to pull back, too. One might say that these developments bring\nus back to Latin 101 and the root of the word “credit.” The root is “credo,” which means\n6\n\n“I believe” or “I trust”—that is, investors’ belief was shaken, both in the information they\nhad on the degree of risk these instruments embodied and in the price they were going\nfor, and they are pulling back from these markets, presumably until they understand these\ninstruments well enough to restore that belief.\nEven with corrections to credit underwriting standards, it still may turn out that\nthese innovations don’t actually spread risk as transparently or effectively as once\nthought, and this would mean—to some extent—a more or less permanent reduction of\ncredit flowing to risky borrowers and long-lasting shifts in patterns of financial\nintermediation. It also could mean an increase in risk premiums throughout the economy\nthat persists even after this turbulent period has passed. In a speech I gave a few months\nago, I focused on the phenomenon of low risk premiums in interest rates throughout the\nworld.2 In fact, there was considerable debate about what might be causing the very low\nprice for taking on risk. What we are seeing now could be the beginning of a return to\nmore normal risk pricing. As such, this development would not be disturbing for the long\nrun. However, as we are seeing, the transition from one regime to the other can be quite\npainful.\nThe Fed has three main responsibilities that pertain to these developments:\npromoting financial stability to help financial markets function in an orderly way,\nsupervising and regulating banks and bank holding companies to ensure the safety and\nsoundness of the banking system, and conducting monetary policy to achieve its\ncongressionally mandated goals of price stability and maximum sustainable output and\nemployment. With regard to its responsibilities for financial market stability, the Fed\n2 Janet Yellen, “The State of the Global Economy,” Presentation to a conference celebrating\nProfessor Rachel McCulloch, Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts, June 15, 2007.\n7\n\nrecently lowered the discount rate by 50 basis points and encouraged banks to borrow at\nthe discount window, emphasizing the broad range of collateral that is acceptable for\nsuch loans. Such collateral includes mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed\ncommercial paper that have become illiquid.\nAs a supervisor and regulator of banks, the Fed has long focused on insuring that\nbanks hold adequate capital and that they carefully monitor and manage risks. As a\nconsequence, banks are well-positioned to weather the financial turmoil. The Fed is\ncarefully monitoring the impact of recent financial developments on the banking system\nand on core institutions involved in the payments system. Importantly, the Fed’s\nsupervisory role has facilitated the collection of timely and reliable information on\ndevelopments in banking and capital markets, and the insights gained through this\nprocess have been critical in shaping the Fed’s response in recent weeks.\nFor the conduct of monetary policy, the main question is how recent financial\ndevelopments and other economic factors affect the outlook for the U.S. economy and the\nrisks to that outlook. The reason this is the main question is that monetary policy’s\nunswerving focus should be on pursuing the Fed’s mandated goals of price stability and\nfull employment. Monetary policy should not be used to shield investors from losses.\nIndeed, investors who misjudged fundamentals or misassessed risks are certain to suffer\nlosses even if policy is successful in keeping the economy on track.\nWith those principles in mind, let me briefly review recent economic\ndevelopments. The U.S. economy turned in a fairly good performance in the first half of\nthe year. Growth in the first quarter was weak, but it picked up to a robust pace in the\nsecond quarter. For the current quarter, payroll employment did not rise as expected, but\n8\n\ninstead actually fell slightly in August, in part due to a drop in construction jobs.\nHowever, recent data on manufacturing output and on orders and shipments for core\ncapital goods have been upbeat, and business investment in equipment and software\npromises to be a bright spot. Despite the hike in borrowing costs for higher-risk\ncorporate borrowers and the illiquidity in markets for CLOs, it appears that financing for\ncapital spending for most firms remains readily available on terms that have been little\naffected by the recent financial turmoil. Of course, the outlook for capital spending could\nworsen if business confidence were shaken by turbulence in global financial markets.\nThat said, financial market turmoil seems likely to intensify the downturn in\nhousing. At the macro level, we would expect some effect on housing demand from the\nrate increases related to these markets, but the impact from rates alone would likely be\nmodest. More important, in my view, are the effects stemming from disruptions to the\navailability of credit and the tightening of lending standards that are occurring. The\nilliquidity in many segments of the market for mortgage-backed securities seems likely to\nlimit credit flows and therefore to have at least some negative effect on real residential\nconstruction, depending on how long the disruptions persist. A key point is that, even\nwhen liquidity in the mortgage-backed securities market improves, the risk spreads\nincorporated in mortgage rates will likely remain higher on a long-term basis than they\nhave been in recent years, and this could prolong the adjustment in the housing sector.\nIndeed, forward-looking indicators of conditions in housing markets were\npointing lower even before the financial market turmoil began. Housing permits and\nsales were trending down. Inventories of unsold new homes remained at very high\nlevels, and they will need to be worked off before construction can begin to rebound.\n9\n\nFinally, most measures of house prices at the national level fell moderately. Notably,\ndespite these declines, the ratio of house prices to rents—a kind of price-dividend ratio\nfor housing—remains quite high by historical standards, suggesting that further price\ndeclines may be needed to bring housing markets into balance. This perspective is\nreinforced by futures markets for house prices, which expect further declines in a number\nof metropolitan areas this year. The downturn in house prices would likely be intensified\nby a simultaneous decline in employment, should that occur, since significant job loss\nwould weaken demand for housing and raise foreclosures.\nBeyond the housing sector’s direct impact on GDP growth, a significant issue is\nits impact on personal consumption expenditures, which have been the main engine of\ngrowth in recent years. The nature and extent of the linkages between housing and\nconsumer spending, however, are a topic of debate among economists. Some believe that\nthese linkages run mainly through total wealth, of which housing wealth is a part. Others\nargue that house prices affect consumer spending by changing the value of mortgage\nequity. Less equity, for example, reduces the quantity of funds available for credit-\nconstrained consumers to borrow through home equity loans or to withdraw through\nrefinancing. The key point is that, according to both theories, a drop in house prices is\nlikely to restrain consumer spending to some extent, and this view is backed up by\nempirical research on the U.S. economy.\nIndeed, in the new environment of higher rates and tighter terms on mortgages,\nwe may see other negative impacts on consumer spending. The reduced availability of\nhigh loan-to-value ratio and piggyback loans may drive some would-be homeowners to\npull back on consumption in order to save for a sizable down payment. In addition,\n10\n\ncredit-constrained consumers with adjustable-rate mortgages seem likely to curtail\nspending as interest rates reset at higher levels and they find themselves with less\ndisposable income.\nAnother engine of growth that could be a little weaker going forward due to the\nongoing turmoil is foreign economic activity. Foreign real GDP—weighted by U.S.\nexport shares—advanced at robust rates of 3¾ to 4 percent in 2004 and through the first\nquarter of this year. This growth was widespread, affecting nearly every continent. With\nthe trade-weighted dollar falling over this same period, U.S. exports have been strong—\nreal exports increased by an average of nearly 8 percent during 2004 through 2006.\nPartly for this reason, U.S. net exports, which consistently held growth down from 2000\nto 2005, actually gave it a lift during 2006. Before the recent global financial turmoil, I\nhad assumed a modest deceleration in world economic activity, which meant that net\nexports were likely to “turn neutral”—neither retarding nor stimulating growth in the year\nor so ahead. At this early stage of the financial turmoil, it’s very difficult to gauge the\nlikelihood of this “neutral” scenario, but it does seem safe to say that these developments\nadd some downside risks to it.\nTo sum up the story on the outlook for aggregate demand, I see significant\ndownward pressure based on recent data indicating further weakening in the housing\nsector and the tightening of financial markets. As I have indicated, a big issue is whether\ndevelopments in the relatively small housing sector will spread to the large consumption\nsector, perhaps through declines in house prices. Should the decline in house prices\noccur in the context of rising unemployment, the risks could be significant.\n11\n\nWhile I do think that the present financial situation has added appreciably to the\ndownside risks to economic activity, we should remember that conditions can change\nquickly for better or for worse—especially in financial markets—so it’s hard right now to\nspeak with a great deal of confidence about future economic developments. It’s also\nimportant to maintain a sense of perspective: past experience does show that financial\nturbulence can be resolved more quickly than seems likely when we’re in the middle of\nit. Moreover, the effects of these disruptions can turn out to be surprisingly small. A\ngood example is the aftermath of the Russian debt default in 1998. Many forecasters\npredicted a sharp economic slowdown as a result; but instead, growth turned out to be\nrobust.\nTurning to inflation, signs of improvement in underlying inflationary pressures\nare evident in recent data. Over the past twelve months, the price index for personal\nconsumption expenditures excluding food and energy, or the core PCE price index, has\nincreased by 1.9 percent. Just several months ago, the twelve-month change was quite a\nbit higher, at nearly 2½ percent. I anticipate that core PCE price inflation will edge\ndown slightly further over the next few years. This view is predicated on continued well-\nanchored inflation expectations. It also assumes the emergence of some slack in the labor\nmarket, as well as the ebbing of the upward effects of several special factors—including\nenergy and commodity prices and owners’ equivalent rent.\nWith that view of recent financial developments and the outlook for the U.S.\neconomy, I’d like to turn to Fed policies. It’s unusual for me to use the plural—\npolicies—because I’m normally referring only to monetary policy in which the FOMC\npursues its dual mandate for the overall economy of full employment and price stability.\n12\n\nHowever, this time around the Fed took a number of steps to help restore liquidity\nin the financial markets, some of which I have already mentioned. One step involved a\nsizable injection of reserves to prevent the federal funds rate from rising above its 5¼\npercent target in the face of huge demands for short-term, liquid funds. In addition, on\nAugust 17 the Fed announced that the discount rate had been cut 50 basis points to\nnarrow the spread with the target federal funds rate. The statement also indicated a\nchange to the usual procedure, namely, to allow loans of up to 30 days, renewable by the\nborrower. Furthermore, the Fed made clear that asset-backed commercial paper, which\nhad become highly illiquid, is acceptable as collateral for discount window borrowing.\nThese efforts to encourage the use of the discount window were designed to promote the\nrestoration of orderly conditions in financial markets by providing depositories with\ngreater assurance about the cost and availability of funding. While helpful, these actions\nhave not, however, served as a panacea.\nOn the same day, the Fed also issued a new statement on monetary policy, which\nsaid, and I quote: “although recent data suggest that the economy has continued to\nexpand at a moderate pace, the Federal Open Market Committee judges that the downside\nrisks to growth have increased appreciably.” This assessment apparently is similar to that\nof market participants. Investors’ perceptions of increased downside risks have resulted\nin a notable decline in the rates on federal funds futures contracts and their counterparts\nabroad. The statement emphasized that the Committee is prepared to act as needed to\nmitigate the adverse effects on the economy arising from the disruptions in financial\nmarkets.\n13\n\nIn determining the appropriate course for monetary policy, we must recognize that\nmost of the data available now reflect conditions before the disruptions began and,\ntherefore, tell us less about the appropriate stance of policy than they normally would. In\naddition to data lags, appropriate policy decisions must also, I believe, entail\nconsideration of the role of policy lags--that is, the lag between a policy action and its\nimpact on the economy. Addressing these policy complications requires not only careful\nand vigilant monitoring of financial market developments, but also the formation of\njudgments about how these developments will affect employment, output, and inflation.\nIn other words, I believe it is critical to take a forward-looking approach—gauging the\neffects of recent developments on the outlook, and, importantly, the risks to that outlook.\n# # #\n14",

    "text": "Presentation to the Western Independent Bankers Association Annual Conference\nKauai, Hawaii\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery March 14, 2005, 8:30 AM Hawaii Time, 1:30 PM Eastern\nThoughts on the Economy and the Banking Sector\nThank you, John, for that kind introduction. I’m delighted to be with you today.\nAs John said, I’m new to the San Francisco Fed. I’m still in my first year as President.\nBut I’m not new to the Federal Reserve System. Nor am I completely new to banking\nissues. When I was a Governor at the Board some ten years ago, I served on the\nCommittee on Markets and Regulation, where we focused on risk management and\nsystemic risk, including supervising risk-taking at banks.\nThat period—the mid-1990s—was a fascinating time to work on banking issues.\nWith the industry getting back on its feet after the dismal days of the early part of the\ndecade, there was renewed energy for change. The legislative groundwork for Gramm-\nLeach-Bliley was being laid. Consolidation and expansion of interstate banking were\nmoving ahead. Securitization was having a profound impact on the role of banks in\nfunding credit. In derivatives markets, large banking organizations were both users and\nmarket makers.\nToday, ten years later, these trends are still changing banking. The challenge for\nthe Fed and the other agencies has been to figure out the appropriate responses of bank\nsupervision and capital regulation. For example, with banks competing in the broader\nfinancial services arena, it has been important in adapting supervision and regulation to\nlimit the attendant burdens on banks. Indeed, when I was at the Board, one of the first\nthings I learned—in a very graphic way—is just how heavily regulated the banking\n1\n\nindustry is. Here’s what happened. When I first joined the committee, I wanted to get up\nto speed on the issues, so I asked for a copy of the Fed’s regulations to review. What I\nexpected was a couple of thick binders. What I got was something else altogether. Some\npoor research assistant came into my office rolling what looked like a grocery store\nshopping cart, and it was filled with volumes of regulations!\nNeedless to say, that image has stuck with me, and it has made me very\nsupportive of efforts to reduce those regulatory burdens wherever feasible. At the same\ntime, there are clear public policy concerns that justify bank supervision of risk and\ncapital regulation. For example, even with all the changes in banking, the potential for\nmoral hazard that’s related to the federal safety net for banks remains a concern. In\naddition, supervision addresses concerns about systemic risk—something that banks\ndon’t fully factor into their own risk-management decisions. That’s why it makes sense\nfor bank supervisors to have a role in ensuring that banks make careful and prudent\ndecisions about the degree of risk they bear and hold capital commensurate with that\ndegree of risk.\nIn my remarks today, I want to start by exploring a key construct underpinning\nthe changes in supervision and regulation of risk that has helped make them less intrusive\nto the operations of banking. I’ll argue that the advances in risk management at banks\nand the changes in the supervision and regulation of banks have occurred through a\nmutually reinforcing process—where sometimes the private sector has taken the lead, and\nsometimes regulation and supervision have helped push risk management forward. Then\nI’ll turn to the impact of the economy on banking in recent years. I’ll conclude with\nsome issues that are on our supervisory radar screen.\n2\n\nSupervision, Regulation, and Risk Management in Banking\nThe idea that advances in risk management at banks and changes in capital\nregulation and risk supervision can be mutually reinforcing processes is not terribly\nsurprising. Although banks and bank supervisors have different motives—which\ncertainly can lead to differing views about what the appropriate level of risk is—they also\nhave a common interest in having accurate measures of risk and in focusing on the\nprocesses and techniques for managing risk. For banks, good risk management is key to\ncreating value for shareholders—that is, profits. For bank supervisors, good risk\nmanagement and capital regulation are key to ensuring the safety and soundness of the\nbanking system.\nA good example of how this common interest led to the mutually reinforcing\nprocess is the focus on capital as a fundamental part of risk management. In the early\n1980s, bank supervisors had good reason to be concerned about banks’ declining capital\npositions. They took the initiative by instituting explicit capital requirements. Then\ncame the first Basel Accord, which took effect in the early 1990s. It broke new ground\nby tying the level of capital to the riskiness of assets. Admittedly, this risk-based\nframework was crude, but it was a start. More importantly, though, Basel I was about\nincreasing capital in banking and putting capital on the front line in risk management,\nboth for supervisors and for banks.\nBasel I did succeed in increasing capital in banking. Today, ninety-seven percent\nof U.S. banks are considered not just adequately capitalized, but actually well capitalized,\n3\n\nand the average risk-based total capital ratio sits at close to thirteen percent. Market\ncapitalization ratios for many banking organizations are even more impressive.\nDespite this success in raising capital ratios, it was apparent early on that the first\nBasel Accord’s approach had flaws, especially for large, complex banking organizations.\nOne serious concern was that some institutions were able to use securitization to reduce\ntheir funding requirements without commensurately reducing their risk. While the\nregulators were able to come up with ways to set capital requirements for such retained\nrisk, it was a bit like writing software patches for an out-of-date operating system. By the\nmid-1990s, it was clear that we needed a new operating system.\nThe path to the new system, Basel II, provides another illustration of the mutually\nreinforcing process. This time, the innovations originated not with the supervisors, but\nwith the bankers. They had developed models that encompass their processes,\nprocedures, and techniques, including statistical models for assessing portfolio risk.\nRegulators saw that these \"state of the art\" risk-management tools also provided the\nmakings of a framework that they themselves could use to address the shortfalls of Basel\nI. Clearly, leveraging the risk-management techniques banks were already using\nrepresented a significant intellectual step forward in bank supervision.\nI realize that when it comes to Basel II, some of you may be thinking, “Why\nshould I care about that?” After all, in the United States, only about ten large, complex,\ninternationally active banks will be required to use internal risk models to determine their\ncapital requirements, and another ten or so may qualify to opt-in to do so. But even if\nyou’re not among those 20 or so institutions, my answer still would be that, indeed, you\nshould care and be knowledgeable about Basel II—perhaps not in terms of the detail, but\n4\n\nin terms of the risk-management principles underlying the framework. The key\nprinciples are: striving to assess your overall portfolio risk and having confidence in the\nreliability of your risk assessment process.\nThe latter goal is actually one that supervision helped to push forward long before\nBasel II. Ten years ago, when I was at the Board of Governors, we rolled out our “risk-\nfocused supervision.” Since then, although we still engage in so-called transactions\ntesting, we have shifted our attention to assessing internal systems and controls for\nevaluating and managing risk. I think this approach has been effective and that it has\nhelped promote better risk management in the banking industry.\nThe economy and banking\nAs I’ve described, risk management at banks and bank supervision were moving\nin the right direction in the second half of the 1990s. But the industry had yet to be tested\nby adverse economic shocks. Well, beginning in 2000, we started to get those shocks:\nthe dot-com bust, the investment bust, then 9/11, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and\nthe corporate governance scandals. Not surprisingly, these shocks led to serious erosion\nin confidence and a pullback in spending by the business sector.\nBoth monetary policy and fiscal policy responded aggressively to these shocks.\nThe Fed slashed short-term interest rates starting in 2001 to their lowest levels in forty\nyears. And the Congress passed tax-cut packages to stimulate spending. But because\nthese macro policies, especially monetary policy, affect the economy with a lag, we still\nhad substantial job losses and clear signs of stress in the corporate sector. For example,\nbond downgrades and defaults rose sharply in the recession, matching levels reached in\n5\n\nthe previous recession. And risk spreads on high-risk corporate bonds spiked, exceeding\nprevious peaks.\nIn the face of these shocks, both large banks and community banks proved to be\nfar more resilient than in the previous recession. And it would appear that the\ndevelopments I’ve been discussing—stronger capital positions in conjunction with\nimprovements in supervision and banks’ advances in risk-management—deserve much of\nthe credit for this resilience. For example, in terms of bank supervision, research\nindicates that supervisory ratings were stiffer for a given set of performance measures\ngoing into the last recession than they were earlier in the 1990s. This is consistent with\nthe shift to risk-focused supervision that I mentioned earlier.\nIn terms of good management, it appears that, even where there were potential\nrisk exposures, banks took relatively safe positions. That is illustrated in the experience\nwith syndicated loans, where the data show increases in risk over the cycle, but with non-\nbanks holding more of the riskier loans than banks. Prudence on the part of banks clearly\ncame into play in other respects, as well. Federal Reserve surveys show that banks\ntightened credit standards and required that loans have lower loan-to-value ratios before\nthe downturn, and our examiners have confirmed that during on-site reviews.\nBefore we pat ourselves on the back for such great supervision and such great\nmanagement, let me point out that some things about the economic environment itself\nturned out to be favorable for the banking industry in this cycle. For one thing, banks\nwere less exposed to the sectors under the most stress, such as telecommunications and\nenergy. Probably the most significant favorable factor was the remarkable strength of\nconsumer spending, especially on durables and housing, which was spurred in part by the\n6\n\nlow interest rate environment. This gave a boost to bank earnings through growth in\nlending, especially mortgage refinancing. Also, commercial real estate loan quality at\nbanks held up relatively well, even with the rise in vacancies and declines in rents, in part\nbecause of the decline in mortgage rates and the rise in refinancing that lowered debt\nburdens for businesses.\nThe economic environment during the current cycle also affected the makeup of\nbank portfolios. With low interest rates and high profits in the recovery, nonfinancial\nbusinesses restructured their balance sheets. They moved to longer-term financing and\nalso tapped internal funding. For large banks this meant a sharp decline in C&I loans and\ncredit enhancements on commercial paper—though they have shared in the rise in bond\nunderwriting. For community banks the restructuring meant a slowdown in C&I lending,\nthough business loan growth was still positive.\nThe restructuring by businesses also reinforced the growth in commercial real\nestate lending at banks, including community banks. Here in the West, the share of\ncommercial real estate loans for banks with under one billion dollars in assets exceeds the\nnational average of twenty-eight percent in most states. Concentration is especially high\nin California, where commercial real estate loans account for forty-six percent of loans\namong community banks.\nAs you know, when residential mortgages are added, total real estate loans\naccount for the lion’s share of the lending among community banks. The average share\nfor the West as a whole is about the same as for the nation—at seventy percent—with\nHawaii at the top with seventy-eight percent, followed by California with seventy-seven\npercent.\n7\n\nThis emphasis on real estate financing by banks is understandable, given\ndevelopments in credit markets. First, residential real estate debt relative to the economy\nhas grown substantially. Even with securitization, it is not surprising that banks would\nshare in the growth, especially given the decline in the role of savings institutions. Also,\nbanks as intermediaries have a comparative advantage in funding more idiosyncratic\ncredit, such as commercial real estate. The commercial real estate mortgage-backed\nsecurities market is growing, but not fast enough to absorb the overall rise in commercial\nreal estate credit. The bottom line is that among community banks there is a notable\ndegree of specialization and the trend has been toward more concentration.\nOutlook for the economy and banks\nThat brings me to the outlook. After the economic expansion stumbled in the\nspring of last year, it now looks to be on a firmer footing. A broad range of economic\ndata suggests that real GDP is growing noticeably above trend. By most estimates, trend\nis around three and a quarter to three and a half percent. We’ve seen vigorous growth in\nbusiness spending and solid growth in consumer spending. Employment hasn’t been\nquite as strong as expected, especially given all the monetary and fiscal stimulus out\nthere. Even so, the economy generated an average of nearly 200,000 new jobs a month\nover the past twelve months.\nAs the economic expansion has firmed over the past few months, the Fed has\nremoved some degree of accommodation, bringing the fed funds rate to two and a half\npercent. In its recent statements, the FOMC has indicated that the expansion seems likely\nto remain on track, with inflation pressures remaining well-contained. So long as this\n8\n\nscenario holds up, the Committee has said that it expects to continue to remove the policy\naccommodation at a pace “that is likely to be measured.”\nAt banks, the renewal of strong growth in C&I lending in recent months is\nconsistent with the rise in business investment. We will probably see business demand\nfor credit rise further with the trimming of profit growth among nonfinancial firms. The\nrepatriation of profits from abroad this year, however, could affect businesses’ demand\nfor credit, at least at the larger banks. Nevertheless, in terms of the ability to borrow,\nbusiness balance sheets overall look to be in good shape in terms of debt burdens.\nWhen it comes to households, we don’t know for sure what levels of debt burden they\nfeel comfortable with. Although the Federal Reserve’s figures on financial obligations\nrelative to income for households have come down some in recent quarters, they are still\nhigh. Nonetheless, the expectation is that consumer spending will continue to grow at a\nmoderate pace.\nFor banks, an expanding economy should support loan growth and good asset\nquality. But there are some areas for caution in the banking outlook, and that brings me\nto what’s on our supervisory radar screen at the San Francisco Fed.\nSupervisory radar screen\nI already mentioned growing commercial real estate concentrations. That’s been\nprominent on our radar screen for some time because concentrations are especially high\nat western banks. Earlier this year, exam staff at the San Francisco Fed concluded a\ndetailed review of some of the most highly concentrated banks that we supervise. They\nfound that loan quality and underwriting is good overall, but concentration risk\n9\n\nmanagement practices are weak. For example, management and directors at most of\nthese banks did not formally acknowledge their concentrations in their strategic or capital\nplanning, nor did they have reports that give them a portfolio-wide view of their risk.\nThe San Francisco Fed has communicated our expectations around high commercial real\nestate concentrations to the banks we supervise, and we’re now at the early stages of\ndeveloping potential interagency guidance.\nGiven the high concentrations at banks in the west—and California in\nparticular—we give considerable attention to commercial real estate market conditions.\nThe good news is that we’ve seen a decline in office vacancy rates around most western\nmarkets since last year’s highs. But something we’re keeping an eye on is the lagged\nresponse in net operating revenues for commercial office and industrial space. This could\nlead to rising bank loan delinquencies and charge-offs. On the plus side, lower mortgage\nrates help ease cash flow pressures, and gains in employment should support higher rental\nrates going forward.\nAnother issue on our radar screen is rapid growth at many western community\nbanks. For example, total loan growth at California commercial banks averaged twenty-\ntwo percent in the past year, excluding new banks. High growth can outstrip a bank’s\ncapital and internal control structure, and we’ve seen banks offer new products and\nservices without formally analyzing the risks and implementing required control and\naudit processes. Additional expansion in a stronger economy could add stress to the\nexisting control environment and management capacity at some banks. Advances in\ntechnology and productivity certainly help support growth, but banks often tell us they’re\n10\n\n“doing more with less,” and some may be tempted to cut corners imprudently. We’ve\nalready seen this in some cases.\nAnother concern related to loan growth is the easing of credit standards and terms\non loans. We expect to see this in an economic expansion, and recent Fed Surveys on\nbank lending confirm that this is occurring. But it’s somewhat troubling that one of the\nreasons banks indicated they’re easing credit conditions is increased competition from\nother banks and non-banks.\nThe rising interest rate environment is also on our radar screen. Even though\nbanks have made considerable advances in managing interest rate risk, there are a few\nthings we’re watching. First, some borrowers may have difficulty meeting higher\npayments on variable-rate loans—especially consumers who already have built up a high\nlevel of debt burden. That said, the potential impact on banks should be limited because\nnonperforming loans are at such a low level right now, and because of offsets from a\nstronger economy. A more significant supervisory concern with the rate environment is\nthat while many banks are understandably positioning their balance sheets for rising\nrates—by shortening asset durations, for example—some are not considering alternative\nscenarios with respect to the shape of the yield curve and the timing of rate changes, and\nwe’ve already seen how the bond market and long rates have fluctuated in reaction to\nsome of the economic uncertainties I mentioned earlier.\nA related issue is the potential impact on liquidity. While deposit growth has held\nup reasonably well, funding may become more challenging as depositors seek higher\nreturns. Banks have many more funding options available today than in the past. But\nrising rates will test banks’ interest rate risk management and funding strategies,\n11\n\nespecially if loan demand jumps concurrently. And though most banks—even small\ncommunity banks—are using sophisticated techniques such as Economic Value of Equity\nand earnings simulation, some banks fall short by not fully understanding their models,\nby failing to validate assumptions on a regular basis, or by using a model that doesn’t\nsupport the size and complexity of operations.\nThe final issue I’d like to touch on is the compliance environment. As I said, I\nam sensitive to the regulatory burden, and I do appreciate the impact of heightened\nattention in several areas such as bank secrecy, anti-money laundering, the Sarbanes-\nOxley Act, and various consumer regulations. Regulatory compliance—in a broad\nsense—is on our radar screen because we’ve seen some banks increase their focus on\ngrowth and efficiency so much that elements of their compliance programs slip. This\nhas happened not only because the desire to reduce costs has made it tempting to cut\ncorners, but also because some banks have not fully appreciated how growth in size and\ncomplexity requires a more robust compliance program.\nAs you know, the banking regulators have had a longstanding role in assessing\ncompliance with various safety and soundness as well as consumer regulations. At the\nFederal Reserve, compliance is an essential component in our evaluation of a bank’s\ninternal controls and risk management framework. Some recent laws have expanded the\nfocus in certain areas—for example, the Patriot Act and SOX 404. But our fundamental\nrole hasn’t changed. What has changed is the environment. Today, weaknesses in a\nbanking organization’s internal control structure and compliance programs translate not\nonly to significant operational risks but also to considerable legal and reputational risks.\n12\n\nConclusion\nIn closing, I want to emphasize that we don’t think widespread problems are\nlikely. Some banks will probably see fallout from the risks I mentioned as well as from\nothers that I didn’t discuss. But industry conditions in many respects are stronger now\nthan they’ve ever been. That undeniable fact, together with the advances in risk\nmanagement I talked about, put the industry overall in a solid position to deal with any\nchallenges that may arise.\n# # #\n13",

I’m delighted to return “home” to the Federal Reserve Bank of\nSan Francisco and honored to kick off the Bank’s second Asia Economic Policy\nConference.\nIn my remarks this morning I will underscore the urgency of strengthened\ninternational policy cooperation to attain strong, sustainable, and balanced\ngrowth in the global economy—a theme that received emphasis at the Group of\nTwenty (G-20) Leaders’ Summit in Cannes earlier this month. The global econ-\nomy is facing critical challenges. The recovery in the United States and other\nadvanced economies has been proceeding too slowly to provide jobs for mil-\nlions of unemployed people. There have also been clear signs of slowing growth\nin emerging market economies over the past year. In effect, we face a dearth\nof aggregate demand, not just among the advanced economies, but also for the\nglobal economy as a whole.\nIn ordinary times, policymakers in the advanced countries would address\nsuch a demand shortfall with expansionary fiscal and monetary policies. But\nthese are no ordinary times. Central banks in a number of advanced econo-\nmies, including the United States, have brought short-term interest rates close\nto zero, so that further monetary accommodation can be provided only through\nunconventional tools, such as securities purchases and forward policy guidance.\nMeanwhile, the scope for fiscal stimulus is limited by concerns about sizable\nbudget deficits and longer-term sustainability.\nAt the G-20 summit earlier this month in Cannes, the United States and other\nadvanced economies—including France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, and the\nUnited Kingdom—agreed to pursue fiscal consolidation plans to place public\nfinances on a sustainable course over the medium term while sustaining the\nauthor’s note: I am indebted to Federal Reserve Board staff members Shaghil Ahmed,\nEric Engen, William English, Joseph Gruber, Steven Kamin, Michael Leahy, Andrew\nLevin, Trevor Reeve, and David Wilcox for their assistance in preparing these remarks.\n\n18 ASIA ECONOMIC POLICY CONFERENCE ASIA’S ROLE IN THE POST-CRISIS GLOBAL ECONOMY\nnear-term recovery. Indeed, in the current environment of weak demand, near-\nterm fiscal consolidation could threaten the economic recovery, which in turn\nmay undermine the success of the fiscal strategy. In such circumstances, econ-\nomies with the capacity to stimulate global growth—namely, countries with\nlarge current account surpluses and the potential to expand domestic demand—\nmust take a leading role in adopting policies to rebalance and sustain the global\neconomy. This commitment was made by all of the G-20 leaders, including those\nfrom China, Indonesia, South Korea, and other emerging markets.\nIn the remainder of my remarks, I will point out some key factors that have\nbeen restraining the pace of U.S. economic growth, and I will discuss the need\nfor fiscal adjustments to place our federal budget on a sustainable path over the\nmedium term without impairing the economic recovery. I will then turn to a\nconsideration of the crucial role of the Asian economies in fostering a stronger\nglobal recovery. Of course, these remarks solely reflect my own views and not\nnecessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nU.s. economic growth\nSince the middle of 2009, the U.S. economy has been recovering from the\nmost severe recession and financial crisis to afflict our country since the Great\nDepression. However, the pace of the economic recovery has been less vigorous\nthan desired or expected, and the unemployment rate has declined only about\none percentage point over the past two years. Indeed, the number of jobs in\nthe private sector remains more than 6 million below the peak level reached in\nearly 2008—a distressing development made all the worse by the fact that new\nentrants have, of course, continued to come into the labor force in recent years.\nThe fraction of those now jobless who have been without work for six months\nor more stands at a very high level. In addition to those officially unemployed,\nmany individuals are involuntarily working part time or have dropped out of the\nlabor force entirely.\nThe pace of economic growth in the second half of this year has been some-\nwhat faster than in the first half, reflecting in part a reversal of the temporary\nfactors that had weighed on growth earlier in the year. Nonetheless, a range\nof more-persistent factors also appear to be restraining the recovery. In rec-\nognition of these drags, the consensus of professional forecasters in the sur-\nvey released in November 2011 by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nwas that unemployment would decline only slightly in the next few years, to an\naverage rate of 8.4 percent in 2013. Moreover, financial market conditions have\ndeteriorated, on net, in recent months, intensifying some of the headwinds fac-\ning the economy.\n\nYELLEN | AGGREGATE DEMAND AND THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC RECOVERY 19\nAt the onset of the financial crisis, consumer spending contracted sharply\nand the personal saving rate began a steep ascent. Exhibit 1 shows that the\nsaving rate rose from around 2½ percent in 2006 to about 5 percent in the first\nhalf of 2011. It now appears that consumer spending is advancing at a moderate\npace. In the pre-crisis years, consumer spending grew rapidly, providing con-\nsiderable impetus to the expansion. In contrast, over the next few years, con-\nsumer spending seems unlikely to serve as one of the main engines of growth.\nThe ratio of household debt-to-income remains exceptionally high, even though\nover the past few years it has declined slightly from the post-World War II peak\nreached prior to the crisis. Although households appear to have made some\nprogress in deleveraging, many still face elevated debt burdens and reduced\naccess to credit. Moreover, high levels of unemployment and underemployment,\nslow gains in wages, and declines in the values of both homes and financial assets\nEXHIBIT 1\nU.s. Household saving Rate\nPercent\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011\nSource: Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n\n20 ASIA ECONOMIC POLICY CONFERENCE ASIA’S ROLE IN THE POST-CRISIS GLOBAL ECONOMY\nhave weighed on household spending and diminished the ability of households\nto tap home equity in emergencies or for other purposes. Consumer sentiment\ndropped markedly over the summer and remains quite depressed, apparently\nreflecting households’ concerns about the broader economy as well as their own\nfinancial situations.\nA sharp downturn in housing was at the core of the previous recession, and\nthis sector continues to weigh on the recovery. Robust increases in housing\nactivity have helped spur recoveries from most U.S. recessions since World War\nII. This time, in contrast, residential construction remains depressed by a large\ninventory of foreclosed and distressed properties either currently available for\npurchase or probably soon to become so, tight credit conditions for construction\nloans and mortgages, and concerns about the possibility of further declines in\nhome prices. As a result, new home construction currently is at only about one-\nthird of its average pace in recent decades. In addition, homeowners with insuf-\nficient equity in their homes have found it difficult to take advantage of today’s\nlow interest rates by refinancing their mortgages. Recently announced changes\nto the federal government’s Home Affordable Refinance Program, or HARP,\nare designed to improve the opportunity for homeowners to refinance, and I’m\nhopeful this program will succeed in reducing household debt service burdens\nand the flow of foreclosures. More generally, I see a strong case for additional\npolicies to foster more-rapid recovery in the housing sector. Indeed, to provide\ngreater support for mortgage markets, the Federal Reserve recently adjusted\nits program for reinvesting its securities holdings.\nThe Federal Reserve continues to provide highly accommodative monetary\nconditions to foster a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stabil-\nity. Moreover, the scope remains to provide additional accommodation through\nenhanced guidance on the path of the federal funds rate or through additional\npurchases of longer-term financial assets.\nChallenges for U.s. Fiscal policy\nTurning now to U.S. fiscal policy, with the onset of the recent recession and\nfinancial crisis, the federal budget deficit widened significantly and has\nremained wide. Exhibit 2 shows that, as a result, federal debt held by the pub-\nlic has increased relative to our national income to a level not seen in the past\nhalf-century. These budget developments have reflected both the weak econ-\nomy, which has depressed revenues and pushed up expenditures, and the fis-\ncal stimulus that was implemented to help ease the recession and support the\nrecovery. So long as the economy continues to recover, the deficit should narrow\nover the next several years as a growing economy boosts revenues and reduces\n\nYELLEN | AGGREGATE DEMAND AND THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC RECOVERY 21\nEXHIBIT 2\nU.s.

Even so, the ratio of debt to gross domestic product (GDP)\nwill continue to edge higher over the next decade unless the Congress and the\nAdministration are able to agree on a program of deficit reduction that is more\nambitious than the targets incorporated in last summer’s Budget Control Act.\nLooking yet further out, it is apparent that, absent significant policy shifts, bud-\nget pressures resulting from the aging of the U.S. population and fast-rising\nhealth-care costs will continue to push the federal debt ratio higher in coming\ndecades. The dashed line in Exhibit 2 shows the Congressional Budget Office’s\nlong-term projection of the debt-to-GDP ratio through 2035 under current pol-\nicy settings, including the effects of the Budget Control Act.\nIt is crucial that the federal budget be put on a sustainable long-run trajec-\ntory, and we should not postpone charting that course. A failure to put in place\na credible plan to address our long-run budget imbalance would expose the\n\n22 ASIA ECONOMIC POLICY CONFERENCE ASIA’S ROLE IN THE POST-CRISIS GLOBAL ECONOMY\nUnited States to serious economic costs and risks in the long term and possi-\nbly sooner. Timely enactment of a plan to put the federal budget onto a sustain-\nable trajectory will make it easier for individuals and businesses to prepare for\nthese adjustments. In addition, the sooner our longer-term budget problems are\naddressed, the less wrenching the adjustment will have to be and the more con-\ntrol that policymakers—rather than market forces or international creditors—\nwill have over the timing, size, and composition of the necessary adjustments.\nAt the same time, too much fiscal tightening in the near term could harm\nthe economic recovery. Significant near-term reductions in federal spending or\nlarge increases in taxes would impose an additional drag on the economy at\na time when aggregate demand is already weak. Indeed, under current law,\nfederal fiscal policy is slated to impose considerable restraint on the growth\nof aggregate demand next year. We need, and I believe we have scope for, an\napproach to fiscal policy that puts in place a well-timed and credible plan to\nbring deficits down to sustainable levels over the medium and long terms while\nalso addressing the economy’s short-term needs. I do not underestimate the\ndifficulty of crafting a strategy that appropriately balances short-run needs\nwith long-run considerations, but doing so would provide important benefits to\nthe U.S. economy.\nThe key Role of the emerging asian economies\nIn light of the various factors weighing on aggregate demand in the United\nStates and other advanced economies, I believe it is crucial for emerging mar-\nket economies, particularly in Asia, to take further steps to boost domestic\ndemand, providing support for their own growth and that of the global econ-\nomy. Indeed, such policies are a core component of the G-20 nations’ commit-\nment to strong, sustainable, and balanced growth.\nOf course, emerging Asia has already made an important contribution to\nbolstering the global economy in the wake of the financial crisis. The top panel\nof Exhibit 3 shows that even though the emerging Asian economies were hit\nquite hard by the global downturn, they recovered much more quickly than did\nother parts of the world. The full extent of the Asian bounceback can perhaps\nbest be appreciated by comparing the level of output in Asia, shown in the bot-\ntom panel of the exhibit, with those in advanced economies and other emerging\nmarket economies. Asia’s output level—the solid black line—has increased sub-\nstantially from its barely perceptible trough. Output in other emerging market\neconomies—the dashed line—has also increased significantly. In comparison,\noutput in the advanced economies—the solid gray line—has not yet attained its\npre-crisis peak.\n\nYELLEN | AGGREGATE DEMAND AND THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC RECOVERY 23\nEXHIBIT 3\nReal gDp\nA Output Growth, Four-quarter Percent Change\nPercent\n12\nAsian emerging market economies\n10\n8\n6\nOther emerging market economies 4\n2\nAdvanced economies\n0\n–2\n–4\n–6\n–8\n2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011\nB Level of Output, 2005:Q1 = 100\nIndex\n170\n160\n150\n140\nAsian emerging market economies\n130\nOther emerging market economies\n120\nAdvanced economies 110\n100\n90\n2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011\nSources: Country sources via Haver; International Monetary Fund; Federal Reserve Board staff calculations.\nNotes: GDP weighted aggregate. Advanced economies consist of Australia, Canada, the euro area, Japan, Swe-\nden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Asian emerging market economies consist of China,\nHong Kong, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand. Other\nemerging market economies consist of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Israel, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia,\nand Venezuela.\n\n24 ASIA ECONOMIC POLICY CONFERENCE ASIA’S ROLE IN THE POST-CRISIS GLOBAL ECONOMY\nA key factor contributing to the relatively rapid recovery of the Asian\nemerging market economies was that, in contrast to many previous episodes of\nsevere stress, these economies were well-positioned to permit the use of coun-\ntercyclical fiscal and monetary policies. Cyclically adjusted fiscal balances in\nemerging Asian economies fell noticeably in 2008 and 2009, reflecting a more\nexpansionary fiscal stance; fiscal stimulus was particularly large in China,\nIndia, and Singapore. Monetary policy was also eased substantially through-\nout emerging Asia.\nPartly as a result of those policy measures, the growth of the emerg-\ning Asian economies over the past several years appears to have relied less\non external demand from the advanced economies. The top panel of Exhibit 4\nshows that the shares of exports in nominal GDP in the Asian economies have\ntrended downwards since 2006 following a decade of solid increases. However,\ntrade balances in the region (shown in the bottom panel of the exhibit) gener-\nally remain in surplus, notwithstanding some recent narrowing in several coun-\ntries. These surpluses suggest that, on balance, the Asian economies continue\nto add more to global supply than to global demand.\nCrucially, private consumption as a share of output still remains quite low in\nseveral emerging Asian economies. Exhibit 5 shows that China’s consumption\nshare—the solid black line—which was already well below that of other major\neconomies in 2000, has fallen steadily over the past decade to about one-third of\nits GDP.1 Private consumption shares in other emerging Asian economies—the\ndashed line—are also significantly below those in the advanced economies—the\nsolid gray line—and have not moved up in the wake of the global financial crisis.\nMeasures to boost private consumption would appear to benefit not only\nthe global economy, but also the emerging Asian economies themselves. China\nand other emerging market economies have already taken some steps to pro-\nmote household consumption, but the progress on this front has been slow and\nfurther measures are warranted. Indeed, at the G-20 Cannes summit, China\npledged to rebalance its demand toward domestic spending through policies\nto bolster household income and strengthen social safety nets, and Indonesia\nand Korea each made similar commitments to facilitate the process of global\nrebalancing.\nWhat are some specific policy measures that could be helpful? First,\nincreased public spending on social services, such as education, health care,\nand retirement benefits, could spur consumption by reducing the need for pre-\ncautionary household saving. In China, some redistribution of the profits of\nstate-owned enterprises to the central government through larger dividend\npayments could provide revenue to support such spending.

Third, addi-\ntional development spending could be directed toward these countries’ poorest\nregions; for example, China has recently strengthened its efforts in this area.\nThe case for boosting investment rates in Asian emerging economies to sup-\nport global demand is less clear-cut. At about 45 percent of GDP, Chinese invest-\nment rates are now so high that the return on new investment may already be\nquite low in some sectors. In a number of other countries, however, investment\nrates are only at about the average of those in the advanced economies. It seems\nplausible that, with their lower capital-to-labor ratios, investment rates should\n\nYELLEN | AGGREGATE DEMAND AND THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC RECOVERY 27\nbe higher in some emerging Asian economies. Indeed, some have argued that\ninfrastructure needs remain extremely pronounced in many emerging market\neconomies, and that a wave of investment may be in the offing for the world’s\ndeveloping economies.2 With low interest rates throughout the world, this would\ncertainly seem to be a propitious time for countries to pursue productive capi-\ntal investment.\nFinally, exchange rate adjustments will play a crucial role in boosting\nemerging Asia’s contribution to global demand. Indeed, the G-20 leaders wel-\ncomed China’s determination to increase exchange rate flexibility and to carry\nout its plans to increase convertibility of the renminbi capital account. Such\nflexibility is crucial if Asian domestic demand is to be expanded without exac-\nerbating inflationary pressures. Exchange rate appreciation channels demand\ntoward foreign products, thereby creating the scope for policies to expand\ndomestic demand without exacerbating inflationary pressures. More gener-\nally, exchange rate flexibility makes it easier for monetary policy to respond to\ndomestic considerations and to achieve price stability. Perhaps most important,\nsince the ultimate goal of economic growth is to improve standards of living,\nallowing the currency to appreciate can help ensure that a greater proportion of\noutput is devoted to household consumption, enabling social welfare to improve\nat a faster pace.\nConclusion\nTo sum up, growth in advanced nations, including the United States, faces seri-\nous headwinds. Households are still deleveraging, corporations are reluctant to\ninvest, and fiscal consolidation is needed over time to place public finances on a\nsustainable course. Despite some pickup in growth in the United States during\nthe second half of 2011, the outlook is for unemployment to diminish only slowly,\nremaining painfully high for many years to come. These developments have also\naffected emerging market economies, where there are now clear signs of slow-\ning growth. In addition, downside risks to global growth have increased signifi-\ncantly because of rising financial market pressures, reflecting an intensification\nof stress in European banking and sovereign debt markets as well as broader\nconcerns about the outlook.\nThese circumstances call for concerted domestic policy actions to boost\ngrowth and create jobs. Indeed, as I already noted, we at the Federal Reserve\nare moving vigorously to promote a stronger economic recovery. However, mon-\netary policy is not a panacea, and it is essential for other policymakers to also\ndo their part. In particular, there is a strong case for additional measures to\naddress the dysfunctional housing market. Stronger housing demand has the\n\n28 ASIA ECONOMIC POLICY CONFERENCE ASIA’S ROLE IN THE POST-CRISIS GLOBAL ECONOMY\npotential to boost recovery. The Congress and the Administration also can sup-\nport the recovery in the near term while simultaneously putting fiscal policy on\na sustainable trajectory in the long term.\nAs I have emphasized in this talk, there is also an urgent need for policy\naction from a number of countries. In Europe, forceful action is essential to\naddress the region’s fiscal and financial stresses, which pose a threat not only\nto growth but also to global financial stability. In addition, many emerging mar-\nket economies, particularly in Asia, have the scope to bolster domestic demand.\nSuch policies would support stronger, more balanced, and more sustainable\nglobal economic growth; they would enhance social welfare at home as well. The\nmost profound effect of the Asian miracle of the past several decades has been\nto lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. Further actions to boost\naggregate demand in Asia will ensure that this miracle is sustained.\nNOTES\n1 Output per capita has been growing very rapidly in China, so per capita consumption has\nalso been rising.\n2 See, for example, McKinsey Global Institute (2010), Farewell to Cheap Capital?

    "text": "Presentation to a conference celebrating Professor Rachel McCulloch: “Is Free Trade Still\nOptimal in the 21st Century?”\nPanel discussion: The State of the Global Economy/Current International Economic Policy\nBrandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery June 15, 2007, 12:20 PM Eastern, 9:20 AM Pacific\nGood afternoon. I’m delighted to take part in today’s program honoring my long-time\nfriend, coauthor, and former colleague, Rachel McCulloch. In my remarks today, I would like to\nfocus on some aspects of the global economy that are salient to me from the standpoint of\nmonetary policy. On the one hand, there is much that is heartening. World economic growth has\nbeen robust during the last few years and, in 2006, according to the IMF’s summary measure,\nperformance was extraordinarily strong—the best in both overall and per capita terms since the\nearly 1970s. China and India both grew at a blistering pace. But, importantly, growth was\nwidely spread around most regions of the globe. At the same time, inflation was reasonably low\namong the advanced economies, and in most emerging markets and developing countries, it was\nquite moderate by historical standards.\nConditions in global financial markets have been supportive of growth. Real interest\nrates and risk spreads have remained relatively low despite monetary tightening by major central\nbanks. Equity markets in many countries have hit new highs, and emerging markets have seen\nincreasing private capital inflows.\nThese good outcomes across a broad range of countries might suggest that the world\neconomy is not a very risky place. But monetary policymakers are paid to worry—to see dark\nclouds, not just silver linings. One worry, now longstanding, relates to the large imbalances in\nsaving and investment flows among countries that underlie the current pattern of global growth.\nStandard debt dynamics suggest that the large and growing U.S. current account current\nimbalance is unsustainable. But theory offers little guidance on exactly how or when it may\nunwind. My concern here is that a sudden unwinding of these imbalances could be associated\nwith sharp movements in exchange rates and asset prices that could produce destabilizing\neconomic impacts around the globe. Given the enormous expertise of this audience on this issue,\nI will focus instead on a distinct but related worry, which concerns the possibility and potential\n1\n\nconsequences of an abrupt and disruptive shift in general risk tolerance in international financial\nmarkets.\nAt present, there are numerous indications that risk premia are notably low--in the U.S.\nand also globally. One indication is the low level of long-term bond rates compared with\nexpected rates on short-term debt in the U.S. and other advanced economies. Of course, long-\nterm rates have risen in recent weeks, but not by nearly enough to resolve what former Fed\nChairman Alan Greenspan coined, “the bond rate conundrum.” Another indication can be found\nin the very low options-based implied volatilities on most types of U.S. financial instruments,\nincluding equities, debt instruments, and exchange rates. Further indications are the narrow risk\nspreads on both foreign private and sovereign securities, which are near historic lows.\nThe phenomenon of low spreads may well reflect an environment wherein risk genuinely\nis reduced. The volatility of both output and inflation has declined substantially in most\nindustrial countries since the mid 1980s, a phenomenon known as the “great moderation.”\nRecessions have become less frequent and less severe in most industrial countries, and inflation\nhas been low worldwide. Arguably, macroeconomic management has improved significantly.\nMoreover, structural changes may have improved the capacity of economies to absorb shocks.\nSince lower macroeconomic volatility reduces the degree of uncertainty facing households and\nfirms, it may explain the lower risk premia.\nIn addition, a number of long-term structural developments associated with technological\nchange and deregulation have reduced transactions costs, diversified and expanded the variety of\ncredit providers, and fostered the creation of new instruments for allocating and pricing risk. For\nexample, the providers of credit go well beyond insured depository institutions to include asset\nmanagers, private equity investors, and hedge funds. Some of the new instruments include\ncollateralized debt obligations, which permit illiquid loan obligations to be securitized, and credit\ndefault swaps, which investors use as insurance against corporate default. Thus, financial\ninnovations and deepening credit markets may have contributed to a wider dispersion and a more\nefficient allocation of risks in financial system and thereby to lower risk premia.\nFinally, there may also be cyclical reasons for the decline in risk premia. Even as short-\nterm nominal rates have risen in the U.S. and elsewhere in recent years, low-interest-rate funds\nhave remained available from other economies, notably Japan and Switzerland. In addition,\n2\n\ncorporate leverage has been low, and this has dampened credit market volatility because debt\nservice costs are low and the threat of default has declined.\nMy concern, however, is that investors may be underestimating the risks in both in\ndomestic and foreign markets as indicated by a number of investment strategies. For example,\nhere in the U.S., the rapid rise of lending at variable rates in the subprime mortgage market may\nhave reflected an unduly benign view of the underlying risks, and some lenders have paid a high\nprice for this view. Inflows into hedge funds have soared and private equity firms are borrowing\nat low interest rates with favorable terms, resulting in a wave of leveraged buyouts in both the\nU.S. and abroad. Some observers question whether the supposedly sophisticated investors in\nthese funds fully understand the complexities of the investment strategies pursued by fund\nmanagers and the risks to which they are exposed.\nIn foreign markets, investor demand for emerging market assets has continued to expand,\nwith inflows into dedicated bond and equity funds in those countries, including instruments\ndenominated in local currencies, without much increase in risk spreads. Low costs of borrowing\nhave also attracted money into “carry trades,” where investors borrow short-term at lower rates\nin one currency and invest, unhedged, in riskier, higher-yielding bonds in another currency. This\nstrategy exposes investors to substantial exchange rate risk.\nThere is, of course, some research into why risk might be underpriced, but so far, the\nanswers remain tentative. Some have pointed to the greater role of investment managers in this\nmore deregulated, competitive environment. These managers may have incentives to herd with\nother investment managers in order not to underperform their peers, and they may also have\nincentives to take more “tail” risks, in cases where compensation is weighted more towards\nachieving positive returns, without sufficient regard for low probability negative returns.1 In\naddition, the apparent confidence of investors that extreme events will not occur has fostered\nincreased demand for higher yield in riskier assets, resulting in greater risk appetite.\nAs we know from past experience, of course, the possibility of a sudden reversal in risk\nperceptions cannot be ruled out. Some recent reversals have had fairly limited effects. For\nexample, in May and June of 2006, rising interest rates increased volatility in advanced\neconomies, sparking a period of turbulence in emerging markets. In late February of this year,\n1 R. Rajan, “Has Financial Development Made the World Riskier?” The Greenspan Era: Lessons for the Future, A\nSymposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City (2005),\npp. 313-369. http://www.kansascityfed.org/Publicat/sympos/2005/PDF/Rajan2005.pdf\n3\n\nthere were sharp movements in global financial markets, sparked by a drop in China’s fledgling\nstock market, as investors reacted to news about fundamentals in the U.S. and elsewhere, but\nmarkets soon recovered.\nBut it does not take a very long memory to recall the serious consequences of the Asian\nfinancial crisis of 1997-98 which eventually escalated into one of global proportions. In that\ninstance, an abrupt increase in investor risk aversion provoked sharp asset price declines and a\nfrightening and sudden erosion of market liquidity. Fortunately, in the years since that crisis, the\nglobal financial system has arguably become far stronger. Many countries have taken advantage\nof the benign global environment and have reduced the ratio of public debt to GDP, improved\nthe currency and maturity composition of debt, and increased international reserve holdings.\nThey have also undertaken measures to increase the resilience of their financial markets, such as\npromoting the development of local currency bond markets. Their banking systems, too, have\nbeen buttressed by stronger supervision, thereby reducing the likelihood of devastating banking\nfailures. Furthermore, the widespread adoption of more flexible exchange rate regimes creates\ngreater scope for monetary policy and hence the potential to contain the economic spillovers of\nsuch turbulence.\nFrom a policy perspective, a natural question is what, if anything, central banks,\nincluding the Federal Reserve, can and should do to address potential risks associated with the\npossibility of excessive risk-taking in global financial markets. To mitigate the risks of financial\ninstability, I believe that policymakers must mainly rely on supervisory tools and prudential\nregulation to ensure that financial institutions are properly capitalized and that they carefully and\ncomprehensively identify, assess and manage risks of all types—market, credit, and operational.\nAt the same time, the Federal Reserve is actively collaborating with other supervisors in the\nUnited States and globally, and encouraging private sector initiatives designed to strengthen the\nresilience of the financial sector and to improve its ability to manage the stresses that might\nemerge in the event of an unanticipated shift in risk preferences. A recent example involves\ncredit default swaps. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has taken steps to promote private\nsector initiatives to correct a serious problem of confirmation backlogs in these contracts and to\nclarify the exposure of counterparties to them. In addition to mitigating potential risks, central\nbanks must be prepared to respond to events that may have systemic effects. This requires\nunderstanding the nature of financial arrangements and their implications for risk. To this end,\n4\n\nthe Fed supports research on financial markets, communicates with institutions well beyond\nthose we directly supervise, and cooperates with financial supervisors around the world.\nSome have espoused the view that central banks should go further--tightening monetary\npolicy to dampen overly euphoric asset markets—to prick asset price bubbles before they burst.\nI do not espouse that view because it is exceptionally difficult to distinguish “bubbles” from\nfundamental-based booms and monetary actions impose certain short-run costs for very\nuncertain future gains. I therefore believe that central banks should stand ready to act to cushion\nthe economy in response to shocks when and if they occur.\n# # #\n5",

Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery July 12, 2007, 12:40 PM Alaska DT, 4:40 PM Eastern\nThe U.S. Economy and Monetary Policy\nGood afternoon, everyone. I’m delighted to have the opportunity to speak to you\ntoday. This is my first trip to Alaska as the President of the San Francisco Fed, and, in\npreparation, I reviewed some of the economic statistics about this region. The numbers\nsay that local employment has been growing at a healthy clip this year, especially in the\ntravel and tourism sector. As a policymaker, it is very nice for me to be able to have\nthose statistics come to life, seeing firsthand the vigor of the economy in Anchorage. As\na tourist, I’m glad to be doing my part to boost the economy here, and so far it has been a\npleasure. For example, yesterday, a group of us visited your outstanding Museum of\nHistory and Art, and the exhibits were truly impressive, as are the plans for its expansion.\nThe museum is a fitting jewel box for the many treasures it holds of the past and present\nof the people and cultures of this state.\nAlaska, of course, is not only famous for its immense natural beauty and its\nfascinating cultures. It also is the home of many of the key natural resources the U.S.\neconomy depends on, and tomorrow I will get a chance to see a bit of that side of the\nstate. Helvi will escort several of us to the DeLong Mountains where we will tour the Red\nDog mine, which operates on land owned by the NANA Regional Corporation. From\nthere, we will go to Kiana, a fishing village 30 miles inside the Arctic Circle in the\nKobuk Valley.\n1\n\nAlthough I obviously get a lot of personal pleasure out of traveling around the\nDistrict to fascinating places like Alaska, I'm also here for important official reasons.\nOne of the great strengths of the Federal Reserve is its connection to the citizenry of the\ncountry. In this respect, the twelve Reserve Banks play a particularly important role.\nThrough our directors, our advisory councils, and through meetings like this one, we can\nget some insight into the public’s viewpoint on issues that are vital to the conduct of\nmonetary policy—issues like labor market conditions, expectations about inflation, and\nindustry-specific developments, to name just a few. So I’m very much looking forward\nto the question and answer session that will follow my remarks, because I’m sure that I’m\ngoing to learn from you as much as you’re going to learn from me!\nThis afternoon I plan to talk about the outlook for the U.S. economy and the\nprospects for monetary policy, concentrating on several important factors shaping that\noutlook. Before I begin my formal remarks, I would like to note that my comments\nrepresent my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal\nReserve System.\nAs many of you probably know, the Federal Open Market Committee last met on\nJune 27 and 28 and voted to hold the federal funds rate, our main policy tool, unchanged\nat 5¼ percent. To most observers of the Fed, the decision probably had a familiar ring to\nit, because the funds rate has been kept at that level for the last twelve months. Indeed,\nmy views concerning the logic of this decision will also have a familiar ring to anyone\nwho has heard me discuss monetary policy during the past year. To my mind, the reason\nfor adopting and maintaining the current stance of policy is that it promises to keep the\noverall economy on an adjustment path where growth is moderate and sustainable. The\n2\n\nvirtues of this path are that it avoids exposing the economy to unnecessary risk of a\ndownturn, while, at the same time, it is likely to produce enough slack in goods and labor\nmarkets to relieve inflationary pressures. I believed a year ago, and still believe now, that\nsuch a path is likely and will enable us to achieve our dual mandate—low and stable\ninflation and maximum sustainable employment.\nAlthough the federal funds rate, has remained unchanged for the past year, a\nnumber of developments over that time have warranted our close attention as well as our\ndeliberate consideration about the appropriate policy response. I plan to focus on several\nof these developments today, and, in particular, the risks they may still pose in diverting\nus from the desired path.\nOne issue concerns the possibility and potential consequences of a shift in\nfinancial conditions that could adversely affect economic activity: I’m thinking in\nparticular about a possible shift in risk perceptions. There are now numerous indications\nthat the premiums in financial returns that compensate investors for risk are notably low.\nOne indication is the low level of long-term bond rates compared with expected future\nrates on short-term debt—in other words, an unusually low term premium.1 Similar\nindications can be found in a variety of places, including narrow spreads for credit risk on\nan array of assets including, with some notable exceptions, corporate debt, commercial\nreal estate, and residential mortgages.\nOne reason that risk premiums may be low is precisely because the environment\nis less risky: the volatility of output and inflation has declined substantially in most\nindustrial countries since the mid-1980s, and a number of financial developments\n1\nSee also Eric Swanson, “What We Do and Don’t Know about the Term Premium,” FRBSF\nEconomic Letter, forthcoming.\n3\n\nassociated with technological change and deregulation have reduced transactions costs,\ndiversified and expanded the variety of credit providers, and fostered the creation of new\ninstruments for efficiently allocating and pricing risk. In addition, the health of corporate\nbalance sheets has improved dramatically, and household delinquency rates, including\nthose on residential mortgages, have generally been quite modest.\nAt the same time, however, the concern has been expressed that some investors\nmay be underestimating risks.2 For example, the rapid rise of lending at variable rates in\nthe subprime mortgage market may have reflected an unduly sanguine view of the\nunderlying risks; as we have seen, some households, large mortgage lenders, and hedge\nfunds have felt the pinch of the problems in this market.\nThe low long-term rates and low risk premiums that have prevailed in financial\nmarkets over the last several years mean that overall financial conditions have been\nnotably more accommodative than suggested by the current level of the real federal funds\nrate. Given that, a shift in risk perceptions would tend to push longer-term rates and\ncredit spreads up, restraining demand.3\nIn fact, we have seen developments that might suggest to some that such a change\nmay be starting. For example, in response to the problems in the subprime variable rate\nmortgage market, rates on certain default derivatives linked to those instruments have\n2\nThere is some research into why risk might be underpriced, but so far, the answers remain\ntentative. Some have pointed to the greater role of investment managers in this more deregulated,\ncompetitive environment. These managers may have incentives to herd with other investment\nmanagers in order not to underperform their peers, and they may also have incentives to take\nmore “tail” risks, in cases where compensation is weighted more towards achieving positive\nreturns, without sufficient regard for low probability negative returns.\n3\nSee Glenn Rudebusch, Brian Sack, and Eric Swanson. 2007. “Macroeconomic Implications of\nChanges in the Term Premium,” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Review, July/August, 89(4),\npp. 241-269.\n4\n\nrecently moved up substantially. In addition, there has recently been some tightening of\nlending standards and higher pricing of debt being issued in connection with private-\nequity financed leveraged buyouts. These recent reassessments of risk premiums seem to\nrepresent the market’s appropriate response to the discovery of a higher probability of\nspecific adverse events. Nonetheless, I also believe such developments are worth\nwatching with some care, since there is always the possibility that they do presage a more\ngeneral and pronounced shift in risk perceptions.\nA particularly noteworthy development is the recent jump in intermediate and\nlong-term interest rates. By mid-June, the nominal yields on five- and ten-year\nTreasuries had shot up by nearly 50 basis points above their May averages, and the\nconventional mortgage rate rose by nearly 35 basis points. Based on evidence from\nTreasury Inflation Protected Securities, the bulk of these increases was accounted for by\nreal yields, while a smaller share was due to compensation for inflation.\nBut I would not say that these increases in long-term rates necessarily reflect a\nsignificant shift in risk perception. Rather, I would point to the fact that they coincided\nwith a sharp upward shift in the expected funds rate path, as suggested by the futures\nmarket. This upward shift followed many months during which markets anticipated that\nthe economy would weaken and that the Fed would respond by cutting interest rates\nfairly substantially. This view prevailed for some time, even though the FOMC’s policy\nstatements have continually emphasized that its predominant concern was the possibility\nthat inflation would not moderate as expected. So I suspect that the markets and the\nCommittee have become more closely aligned, sharing the view that growth in the U.S.\nis, and is likely to remain, healthy. In further support of this view, stock market values\n5\n\nhave risen and implied volatilities have been flat or trended down, as we continue to get\nstronger news on overall economic growth. Moreover, these developments—robust\neconomic data, rising long-term rates, higher expected policy paths and climbing stock\nmarket indexes—are global phenomena, occurring in many industrialized countries.\nInsofar as the rise in longer-term rates seems to be a response to favorable\neconomic conditions—developments that have been part of my own forecast for some\ntime—it has not had a big effect on my overall assessment of the economic outlook. For\nthe very same reason, this rise in longer-term rates does not quell my concerns about a\nreversal in risk perceptions, a possibility which itself could pose a downside threat to the\nglobal economy.\nWith that perspective on recent financial developments in mind, let me now turn\nto an explicit discussion of the U.S. economy and the outlook for growth and inflation.\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2006, real GDP growth moderated noticeably,\nregistering 2 to 2½ percent rates in the final three quarters of 2006, somewhat below most\nestimates of the economy’s potential growth rate. Growth in the first quarter of 2007 was\nnotably weaker, but a good part of that was due to the temporary effects of business\ninventories and net exports. Based on partial monthly data, it seems likely that there was\na bounce-back in the second quarter, with growth averaging a modest rate for the first\nhalf of the year as a whole. My expectation is for moderate growth during the remainder\nof this year and in 2008.\nI’d like to highlight developments in three sectors that will have an important\ninfluence on whether this forecast proves accurate. Two of them—personal consumption\nexpenditures and exports—have been quite robust but are expected to slow moderately.\n6\n\nThe third is residential investment, which has been quite weak, but it is expected to have\na much less negative impact on overall activity going forward. Thus, overall real GDP in\nthe coming period will depend importantly on how the cross-currents among these three\nsectors play out.\nPersonal consumption expenditures have been the main engine of growth in\nrecent years; indeed, with employment growth strong and equity and housing wealth\nrising, American consumers outspent their earnings, and that resulted in a personal saving\nrate that has been in negative territory since early 2005. Going forward, at least some of\nthe growth in consumption can be expected to diminish for a couple of reasons. First,\nincreases in housing wealth have slowed dramatically. Second, energy prices have\nmoved back up this year. For example, after falling through the latter half of last year,\nthe price of West Texas Intermediate rose sharply during the first half of this year. It\naveraged $67.50 in June, up from $54.20 in January; and with gasoline margins moving\nup over this period, the retail price of gasoline has moved up even more. Such increases\nact like a tax on consumers, often leading to reduced spending. Of course, here in\nAlaska, their impact has been largely beneficial. As you know, high oil prices bring\nsubstantial income into the state, and, no doubt, this has helped to keep employment and\npersonal income growing at a healthy clip.\nAnother source of strength in recent years has been the very strong world\neconomy. Foreign real GDP—weighted by U.S. export shares—advanced at robust rates\nof 3¾ to 4 percent in 2004 through 2006, and this growth has been widespread, affecting\nnearly every continent. With the trade-weighted dollar falling over this same period, U.S.\nexports have been strong—real exports increased by an average of nearly 8 percent\n7\n\nduring those three years. Partly for this reason, U.S. net exports, which consistently\nweighed growth down from 2000 to 2005, actually gave it a lift during 2006. Assuming a\nmodest deceleration in world economic activity, net exports seem likely to “turn\nneutral”—neither retarding nor stimulating growth in the year or so ahead.\nOf course, a big drag on growth over the past year has come from residential\nconstruction. Housing is likely to remain an important source of weakness, so let me take\na few moments to discuss it in detail. The cooling in the housing sector has, of course,\nbeen in part a response to a rise in financing costs. Interest rates on variable-rate\nmortgages have risen in recent years along with other short-term rates. However, until a\nfew weeks ago, traditional fixed mortgage rates were actually down somewhat from their\nlevel at the beginning of the Fed rate tightening in mid-2004. With the recent increases,\nthese rates now also are up. I should note that higher borrowing costs are not the only\nexplanation for the recent cooling; it’s likely that it also reflects a necessary correction in\nhouse prices after years of phenomenal run-ups that ultimately have proved to be\nunsustainable.\nSince the end of 2005, activity in this sector has contracted substantially. Indeed,\nover the past four quarters, the level of residential investment spending declined more\nthan 16 percent in real terms. And during that period, this sector—which represents only\na little more than 5 percent of U.S. GDP—has taken a large toll on overall activity,\nsubtracting a full percentage point from real GDP growth.\nThe more forward-looking indicators of conditions in housing markets have been\nmixed recently. Housing permits and sales have been weak. House prices at the national\nlevel either have continued to appreciate, though at a much more moderate rate than\n8\n\nbefore, or have fallen moderately, depending on the price index one considers. Looking\nahead, futures markets are expecting small price declines in a number of metropolitan\nareas this year. Finally, and importantly, inventories of unsold new homes remain at very\nhigh levels, and these most likely will need to be worked off before we see a rebound in\nhousing construction.\nThe prospects for the housing market may also be affected by developments in\nthe subprime mortgage market. I should note that the Fed pays close attention to these\ndevelopments, not only because of their potential impact on the economy, but also\nbecause of our roles in bank supervision and regulation and in consumer protection.\nFrom the standpoint of monetary policy, I do not consider it very likely that\ndevelopments relating to subprime mortgages will have a big effect on overall U.S.\neconomic performance, although they do add to downside risk. The types of subprime\nloans of greatest concern are variable-rate mortgages. Delinquency rates on these loans\nhave risen sharply since the middle of last year—they are now nearly 12 percent—and\nthere are indications that lenders are tightening credit standards for these borrowers.\nLooking more broadly across all types of mortgages, however, delinquency rates have\nremained low; this includes prime borrowers with fixed-rate and variable rate mortgages\nand even subprime borrowers with fixed-rate loans. Tighter credit to the subprime sector\nand foreclosures on existing properties have the potential to deepen the housing\ndownturn. I am nonetheless optimistic that spillovers from this sector will be limited,\nbecause these mortgages represent only a small part of the overall outstanding mortgage\nstock.\n9\n\nHousing markets in Alaska have not been immune to the slowdown observed\nnationwide, but, in part because of high oil prices, economic conditions here have been\nhealthy and this has limited the intensity of the downturn in housing. In 2006 as a whole,\nsales of existing homes rose in Alaska while they were falling nationwide. However, the\npace of sales here actually fell in the second half of last year and early this year, and the\npace of home price appreciation has slowed substantially since 2005. Nevertheless, in a\ndeparture from the longer-term trend, the rate of appreciation here has been above the\nU.S. pace for the past couple of years.\nThe relatively consistent performance in Alaska’s housing market thus far has\nhelped the state to avoid significant problems with respect to mortgage financing and\npayments. As in the nation as a whole, default and delinquency rates overall have\nremained low at least though early 2007. Delinquencies on adjustable-rate mortgages in\nthe prime as well as the sub-prime market have increased somewhat in Alaska over the\npast year or two, but these increases have not been sufficiently large or widespread to\nsignificantly undermine mortgage credit conditions on net.\nThe bottom line for housing from a national perspective is that it has had a\nsignificant depressing effect on real GDP growth over the past year. While I wouldn’t\nwant to bet on a sizable upswing, I also wouldn’t be surprised to see it begin to stabilize\nlate this year or next. Furthermore, if and when it does stabilize, it could contribute to a\npickup in overall growth in the future, as the negative force of its contraction turns\nneutral.\nTo sum up the story on output, real GDP appears to have advanced at a modest\nrate in the first half of this year. My best guess is that the pace will pick up a bit in 2007\n10\n\nto a rate just below potential, as housing’s negative effect eases up enough to offset the\nexpected modest slowdowns in consumption and exports. As I’ve indicated, these\ncrosscurrents may play out in unexpected ways, entailing both upside and downside risks,\nand they will bear careful watching.\nIndeed, careful watching will be required even if the scenario for economic\nactivity that I see as the best guess and the best hope comes through. The reason is that a\nkey part of the desired adjustment path would involve the emergence of enough slack in\nlabor markets to counteract inflationary pressures. The latest labor market data show\npayroll employment growing steadily and at a robust pace. Moreover, the unemployment\nrate has, somewhat surprisingly, declined by half a percentage point over the past two\nyears and now stands at 4½ percent; that rate may represent a degree of tightness in the\nlabor market. If labor markets are indeed on the tight side, and if they remain there, then\nthere may be reason for concern about the risk of building inflationary pressures.\nThis situation highlights a puzzle I have discussed before: Why has the labor\nmarket continued to be so strong, even while economic activity has moderated? Let me\nbriefly outline some possible explanations, beginning with the more worrisome ones.\nOne such explanation is that goods markets could be stronger than we think. This is a\npossibility because an alternative measure of real activity—real income—is considerably\nstronger than our standard measure of real GDP—which we normally measure on the\noutput side. So, it’s possible, but by no means certain, that real GDP could be revised up\nin future benchmark revisions, meaning that both labor and product markets actually\nmight contain inflationary pressures at present.\n11\n\nSecond, a number of experts are now arguing that trend productivity growth may\nhave slowed a bit recently,4 which might mean that the growth of potential output is\nlower than commonly assumed. Indeed, productivity has been surprisingly weak over the\npast year. Of course, discerning the extent to which this development reflects a short-\nlived, cyclical phenomenon, a downshift in the trend rate or both, is neither obvious nor\nstraightforward. Those who believe that trend productivity growth has slowed a bit point\nto the slowdown in the first half of this decade in both the pace of productivity growth in\nthe IT sector and the pace of investment in equipment and software, two factors that\ndrove the productivity boom that began in the mid-1990s.\nAlthough this argument may well be correct, it seems likely to me that the recent\ndecline in the productivity data mainly reflects cyclical factors; in other words, it is likely\ndue to labor hoarding and lags in the adjustment of employment to output—common\nphenomena in periods when economic activity decelerates. Interestingly, most of the\nrecent slowdown in labor productivity growth can be accounted for by such lags in just\none sector—residential construction. Although this sector has experienced huge drops in\nspending, employment has been remarkably well sustained. Going forward, as the\nadjustment lags work themselves out, residential construction employment may post\nsignificant declines and productivity in that sector and the economy as a whole may\n4\nStephen D.

The possibility of long lags in the adjustment of employment to economic\nactivity is a benign explanation for the puzzle.\nAnother benign possibility is that labor markets may not actually be particularly\ntight. There are a variety of ways to estimate conditions in the labor market, and some of\nthese don’t suggest much in the way of inflationary pressures. For example, the\nConference Board index of job market perceptions, which is based on a survey of\nhouseholds, suggests that labor markets are only very slightly on the tight side.\nMoreover, if labor markets were tight, this could be expected to show up in robust growth\nof labor compensation. Instead, some of the data present a different picture: for example,\nthe employment cost index shows remarkably restrained increases of only a little more\nthan 3 percent over the past year.\nAt this point, I am not inclined to discount heavily these benign explanations.\nLooking at the price inflation data over the past year or so, signs of improvement are\nevident. Over the past twelve months, our main measure of consumer inflation—the\nprice index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, or the\ncore PCE price index—has increased by just under 2 percent. Just a few months ago, the\ntwelve-month change was quite a bit higher, at nearly 2½ percent.\nMoreover, I expect to see some further improvement in core inflation over the\nnext year or two. First, this should occur as the economy develops some slack in\nresponse to real growth that is modestly below the potential rate. Second, inflation may\nhave been elevated partly because of some transitory factors that may unwind over the\nnext year or so. One of those transitory factors is oil prices. Although core inflation, by\ndefinition, excludes energy prices, they still may affect it to the extent that they are\n13\n\npassed through to the prices of other goods and services. While oil prices have risen\nrecently, they are still below their peaks of mid-2006. Over the two and a half years\nbefore that, energy prices more than doubled, and this probably put some upward\npressure on core inflation. However, the effects of energy price changes on inflation are\ninherently temporary, and these upward pressures are likely to dissipate in 2007, even if\nenergy prices remain at their current levels.\nAnother transitory factor is upward pressures on rents, including imputed rents on\nowner-occupied housing that enter importantly into the calculation of the price of housing\nservices and, therefore, consumer inflation. Over the last year, rents have been rising at\nan unusually rapid rate. But if rents adjust to more normal levels relative to house prices,\nthese increases will taper off, also damping inflation.\nThat said, the risks to inflation are also significant. One I have already mentioned\nis the possibility that structural productivity growth has slowed, which could add to cost\npressures. While cyclical swings in productivity are not generally passed on to product\nprices, a decline in structural productivity growth might escalate inflation pressures.\nAnother risk is possible slippage in the market’s perception of our inflation objective.\nAlthough inflation compensation over the next five years, as measured in Treasury\nmarkets, has been essentially unchanged recently, longer-run inflation compensation rose\nmodestly, along with the rise in long-term rates that I discussed earlier. My guess is that\nthis increase largely reflects an elevation in inflation risk premiums or the influence of\nsome idiosyncratic factors affecting the demand for Treasury debt, rather than an increase\nin long-run inflation expectations. I base this conclusion on the fact that longer-run\ninflation compensation also ticked up in the United Kingdom, a country where inflation\n14\n\nexpectations have been remarkably well anchored over the past decade and where\ninflation has been trending downward. The fact that longer-run inflation compensation\nrose in both countries, despite their different monetary policy regimes, suggests that a\ncommon explanation is needed, rather than one specific to the U.S. This result suggests\nthat inflation expectations in the U.S. continue to be well anchored as they have been for\nat least the past ten years or so, as the Fed has established its credibility with the public\nabout both its commitment to and its competence in keeping inflation at low and stable\nrates.5\nTurning to monetary policy, I hope I’ve made it clear that—based on what we\nknow now—I think the current stance of policy is likely to foster sustainable growth with\na gradual ebbing of inflationary pressures. It has been heartening to see core consumer\ninflation edging down in recent months. However, as the most recent statement noted, “a\nsustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated.”\nMoreover, upside risks to inflation continue to be present, given the possibility that labor\nmarkets are somewhat tight. I believe it is important to be particularly attentive to these\nrisks not only because price stability is desirable in its own right, but also because a\ncredible commitment to keeping inflation low and stable is necessary to ensure that\ninflation expectations remain well-anchored. At the same time, we must be careful not to\npose unnecessary risks to continued expansion.\nAn “asymmetric policy tilt” seems appropriate given the upside risks to inflation.\nHowever, it is also essential that policy retain considerable flexibility in responding to\n5\nSee Bharat Trehan and Jason Tjosvold, “Inflation Targets and Inflation Expectations: Some\nEvidence from the Recent Oil Shocks,” FRBSF Economic Letter, 2006-22, September 1, 2006.\nFor a discussion of related issues, see John Williams, “Inflation Persistence in an Era of Well-\nAnchored Inflation Expectations,” FRBSF Economic Letter, 2006-27, October 13, 2006.\n15\n\nemerging data. Last week’s FOMC statement thus continued to emphasize that “Future\npolicy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and\neconomic growth, as implied by incoming information.”\n# # #\n16",

Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery Thursday, October 30, 2008, 12:15 PM Pacific, 3:15 PM Eastern\nThe Mortgage Meltdown, Financial Markets, and the Economy1\nGood afternoon, everyone, and thank you for inviting me to speak to you today.\nThis conference on “The Mortgage Meltdown, the Economy, and Public Policy” could\nnot be more timely. The mortgage meltdown is far from over, the economy and financial\nmarkets are still reeling from it, and policymakers have responded by taking some of the\nmost momentous steps in decades. Today I’d like to consider these developments from\nmy perspective at the Federal Reserve. I know you also will be hearing from Chairman\nBernanke later in the conference. As always, these are my own views and not necessarily\nthose of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nMy aim is to help tee up the other sessions in the conference by providing a look\nat the current interactions between mortgage markets, financial markets more generally,\nfinancial institutions, and macroeconomic performance. In brief, if anyone ever needed a\ndemonstration of the strength of the links between the functioning of the financial system\nand the functioning of the economy, this is it. The downturn in housing construction\ndirectly weakened economic activity, while the drop in house prices precipitated a\ngenuine crisis in financial markets, which has generated a severe credit crunch. The\ncredit crunch, in turn, has left households and firms with fewer resources to finance\nspending, and as a result, output growth has weakened further and unemployment has\nrisen. And, of course, weak output growth and higher unemployment undermine\n1 I would like to thank John Judd, Fred Furlong, and Judith Goff for outstanding assistance in preparing\nthese remarks.\n1\n\nhouseholds and the housing sector, which worsens the credit crunch, which saps\nspending, and the adverse feedback loop goes on.\nThe Fed has responded both by easing the stance of monetary policy—including\nthe 50 basis point cut earlier this week—and by supporting financial stability through\nenhancing market liquidity. I believe that these actions have been helpful. But, the\nenormity of this crisis required more. In particular, the passage earlier this month of The\nEmergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 made possible an infusion of capital into\nthe financial sector, a crucial step in breaking the momentum of the adverse feedback\nloop.\nAnother approach to resolving the crisis involves addressing the problems\nplaguing the housing market directly, through increased aid to distressed homeowners to\nmitigate foreclosures or through broad-based incentives to boost the demand for housing.\nSuch policies deserve consideration because they go to the heart of the problem, the\nfallout from the boom and bust in the housing market, and that is what I will turn to next.\nHousing\nThe bust in the housing markets has, of course, been hitting the economy for some\ntime. Although residential investment accounts for only a small share of overall\neconomic activity, its decline over the past three years has been a major drag on real GDP\ngrowth. During this period, housing starts have plummeted and are down by over 30\npercent just in the past year. Yet inventories of unsold new and existing homes remain at\nvery high levels, especially relative to sales, making it difficult to predict with any\nconfidence when starts will bottom out.\n2\n\nIndeed, the possibility of ongoing contraction in this sector is intensified by the\ninterplay of the economic downturn and the credit crunch. Understandably, financial\ninstitutions have tightened lending terms, making it more difficult to qualify for a\nmortgage by requiring higher down payments, higher income-to-payment ratios, and\nhigher FICO scores. Moreover, private-label securitized markets for residential\nmortgages are essentially closed for business. The only remaining sources of mortgage\nsecuritization are the government-sponsored enterprises, especially Fannie Mae and\nFreddie Mac, which provide backing mainly for conventional conforming mortgages.\nFor higher risk borrowers, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is close to the only\ngame in town.\nAlong with the decline in construction, house prices have fallen by around 15 to\n20 percent from their peak, depending on which measure you use. Unfortunately, this is\nanother case where the bottom is not yet in sight. First, the ratio of house prices to rents\nstill remains high by historical standards, suggesting that further price declines are\nneeded to bring housing markets into long-run balance. Second, the large inventories of\nunsold homes I mentioned—a growing share of which are foreclosures—also can be\nexpected to continue to put downward pressure on prices. In view of these factors, it’s\nnot surprising that futures contracts for house prices developed by Chip Case and Bob\nShiller predict further declines. They may have more to say about this later in this\nconference.\nThe Mortgage Meltdown\n3\n\nThe decline in house prices appears to be the crucial “falling domino” that set off\nthe chain of distress that now plagues financial markets and the economy. Problems first\nappeared with the growing delinquencies and foreclosures in the subprime mortgage\nmarket. Currently, more than 20 percent of them are seriously delinquent2 or in\nforeclosure. Real trouble spots include parts of Nevada, Florida, and Ohio, and here in\nCalifornia, the highest delinquency rates are in the Central Valley—with Merced and\nStockton as leading examples.\nAs many of you know, the Fed has embarked on a number of studies relating to\nthe subprime mortgage market. In fact, two colleagues of mine who are prominently\ninvolved—Paul Willen of the Boston Fed and John Krainer of the San Francisco Fed—\nare on the program for this conference. The research they and others have done on the\nvariation in subprime delinquency rates across regions and over time confirms that the\nriskiness of the borrower pools and the quality of the underwriting standards help to\nexplain the incidence of subprime delinquencies. However, the single best predictor of\nthe level and change in these delinquency rates is the pace of house price increases or\ndecreases. In fact, the research suggests that differences in house-price changes account\nfor much of the regional differences in delinquency rates, whether borrowers are prime or\nnonprime, or whether loans have fixed or variable rates.3\nIt is not hard to see why falling house prices matter so much. The amount of\nequity in a home affects the ability or willingness of homeowners to keep current on their\n2 60 days or more past due.\n3 C. Foote, K. Gerardi, L. Goette, and P. Willen (forthcoming), “Just the Facts: An Initial\nAnalysis of Subprime’s Role in the Housing Crisis.” Journal of Housing Economics; K. Gerardi,\nA. Shapiro, and P. Willen (2007), “Subprime Outcomes: Risky Mortgages, Homeownership\nExperiences, and Foreclosures,” Working Paper 07-15 (Boston: Federal Reserve Bank of\nBoston).\n4\n\nmortgage payments when they face personal setbacks, such as illness, divorce, or the loss\nof a job. In a market in which house prices have been declining, a borrower with a recent\nmortgage secured with little or no down payment does not have the flexibility to tap into\nthe equity in the house to weather these problems or may be unable to refinance or sell\nthe house for enough to cover the outstanding mortgage balance. Moreover, in states like\nCalifornia, where a primary residence represents no-recourse collateral for many\nmortgages, some borrowers who may be able to afford their loans may nevertheless be\nunwilling to make the payments if house prices are expected to remain low or to decline.\nI would note, however, that historically many homeowners with under-water mortgages\nhave not ended up in foreclosure.\nAn additional factor that intensified the effect of house price declines on subprime\ndelinquencies is that many of those loans were designed to be bridge loans. For example,\nso-called 2-28 loans were set up at fairly high initial mortgage rates for borrowers with\nlow FICO scores. If such a borrower made the payments, and if the price of the house\nrose as expected, the borrower would be able to refinance, presumably at a lower rate, in\ntwo years. However, once it became apparent that house prices were falling and,\ntherefore, that the refinancing opportunity was lost, many of these loans went into default\neven before the initial two-year period expired.\nSo far, I’ve focused on problems with subprime mortgages. But more recently,\nthe problems have spread: the number of serious delinquencies on alt-A loans and even\nadjustable-rate prime mortgages, is now on the rise. In addition, foreclosures on the 2007\nvintages of mortgages are rising at about the same rate as those of earlier vintages. This\nis sobering, because many of the loans in these later vintages—especially those issued in\n5\n\nthe second half of 2007—benefited from the tighter underwriting standards put in place\nonce the crisis hit. Most likely, then, the rising foreclosures are related not just to falling\nhouse prices, but also to the weakened economy and, in particular, to the nearly 1½-\npercentage-point increase in the unemployment rate over the past year.\nThe erosion in credit quality that afflicts not only subprime but also prime\nmortgage and home equity loans has also now spread across the full spectrum of\nconsumer loans, including, credit card, closed-end consumer, and automobile loans.\nThese losses are compounding the pressures on financial institutions and exacerbating the\nresulting credit crunch.\nThe Financial System\nSome have asked why policymakers and others didn’t see all of this coming. A\nlot of people talked about a bubble in home prices that could eventually collapse and lead\nto sizable credit losses and significant negative wealth effects. I think the answer is that a\nlot of people also did not fully understand how these effects would be magnified by\nseveral key features of the financial system—features that have interacted with one\nanother to produce a deep wariness about counterparty risk and a freezing up of credit\nflows. Each of these features corresponds to one of the three main elements of a balance\nsheet: assets, capital, and liabilities.\nI’ll start with assets. Here, a part of the problem is with the new securities and\nrelated derivatives that have been used extensively in this decade in mortgage finance\nand, in fact, throughout the financial system. They were once considered “state of the\nart”—dazzlingly complex, capable of spreading risk, and constructed using sophisticated\n6\n\nmathematical models to price the risk. But it turns out that their very complexity makes\nit incredibly difficult now to know where the risk actually resides or how to price it,\ngiving rise to major concerns about counterparty risk.\nTurning to capital, the problem is that there is a shortage—in other words, too\nmuch leverage—among financial institutions as a whole. Capital in many banking\norganizations has been adversely affected because of write-downs of many of the\ncomplex instruments I referred to and because of credit losses primarily associated with\ndelinquencies and foreclosures on real estate loans. Moreover, investment banks and\nother entities in the so-called shadow banking sector were very highly leveraged, with the\nratio of assets to capital exceeding 30 to 1 in many cases. Such slim equity cushions\nincrease firms’ exposure to insolvency in the face of credit losses or asset write-downs.\nFinally, on the liability side, the problem is that many leveraged financial\ninstitutions relied heavily on very short-term debt—often overnight loans—to fund their\noperations. This has made them vulnerable to “runs,” especially in an environment\nwhere everyone knows that the system is exposed to impaired assets, where it is hard to\ndetermine exactly where those risks reside, and where some firms are known to have only\nslim equity cushions.\nAs financial firms have struggled to fix their own problems, the systemic\nconsequences have become painfully apparent. Firms have tightened lending standards,\ntrying to improve credit quality, and reduced the volume of loans. They have also been\nselling assets in an effort to deleverage their balance sheets. However, the simultaneous\nattempts of so many firms to deleverage have depressed asset prices to fire-sale levels,\nproducing additional losses and thereby creating selling pressures for other firms holding\n7\n\nsimilar positions. Write-downs on such securities are reducing the already diminished\nequity cushions in some firms and raising their leverage at a time when they desire less\nleverage, not more.\nThis vicious cycle has led to outright illiquidity in markets for certain asset-\nbacked securities, making it almost impossible to determine appropriate prices and\nlargely eliminating them as a source of new funding to borrowers. Moreover, financial\ninstitutions, and even nonfinancial firms, have become very reluctant to lend to each\nother, except at the shortest maturities, since they are uncertain about what demands they\ncould face and whether they will be able to borrow to meet them; as a result, they are\nhoarding their liquidity. These responses have led to a greatly reduced flow of credit in\nthe economy, which is the major factor responsible for the economic downturn that now\nis under way. In other words, we are in the grip of an adverse feedback loop in which a\ncredit crunch exacerbates economic weakness, which in turn weakens financial\ninstitutions, intensifying the credit crunch.\nThe Economic Outlook\nIndeed, recent data on the economy have been deeply worrisome. Data released\nthis morning reveal that the economy contracted slightly in the third quarter. For the\nfourth quarter, it appears likely that the economy is contracting significantly. Mainly for\nthis reason, inflationary risks have diminished greatly.\nOver the past year or so, the FOMC has cut its federal funds rate target by 425\nbasis points to its current level of 1 percent. Nonetheless, most private-sector borrowing\nrates are higher now than at the beginning of this crisis in August 2007. In pointing this\n8\n\nout, I don’t mean to imply that the rate cuts did no good: borrowing rates in my view\nwould be substantially higher absent the reduction in our base lending rate. It’s just that\nthe effects of the growing credit crunch have outpaced the easing of policy, and, indeed,\nevery major sector of the economy has been adversely affected by it.\nFor consumers, the credit crunch is one of several negative factors accounting for\nthe decline in spending in recent months. Consumer credit is costlier and harder to get:\nloan rates are up, loan terms are tougher, and increasing numbers of borrowers are being\nturned away entirely. This explains, in part, the exceptional weakness we have seen in\nauto sales. In addition, of course, employment has now declined for nine months in a\nrow, and personal income, in inflation-adjusted terms, is virtually unchanged since April.\nFurthermore, household wealth is substantially lower as house prices have continued to\nfall and the stock market has declined sharply.\nBusiness spending, too, is feeling the crunch in the form of a higher cost of capital\nand restricted access to credit. In particular, many companies find that the financial\nmarkets have become unreceptive to their commercial paper, an important source of\nshort-term funding. Some of our business contacts report that bank lines of credit are\nmore difficult to negotiate, and many indicate that they have become cautious in\nmanaging liquidity, in committing to capital spending projects that can be deferred, and\neven in extending credit to customers and other counterparties. Nonresidential\nconstruction also is headed lower largely because of the financial crisis; the market for\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities, a mainstay for financing large projects, has all\nbut dried up.\n9\n\nMany state and local governments are being dragged deeper into the financial\nmess as well. The downturn in the economy has bitten into their tax revenues, and\ndisruptions in financial markets have made it harder for them to issue bonds.\nUntil recently, weakness in domestic final demand was offset by a major boost\nfrom exporting goods and services to our trading partners. Unfortunately, economic\ngrowth in the rest of the world has slowed noticeably. There are a number of reasons for\nthe slowdown abroad, including spillovers from the U.S. downturn, and most\nimportantly, the financial meltdown that now has intensified substantially in Europe and\nelsewhere. In addition, the dollar has appreciated recently against the currencies of many\nof our trading partners, offsetting a portion of the depreciation that was boosting U.S.\nexports. As a result, exports will not provide as much of an impetus to growth as they did\nearlier in the year.\nPolicy Approaches\nNow that I’ve reviewed the current economic situation, I’d like to turn to policy,\nwith a discussion of actions taken so far, and additional remedies that bear serious\nconsideration. I’ve already mentioned the FOMC’s substantial easing of monetary\npolicy. In addition, the Fed has ramped up its use of an arsenal of liquidity tools,\ndevising new facilities to lend directly to banks, primary dealers, money market mutual\nfunds, and nonfinancial firms that have been frozen out of the credit markets. These\nfacilities reduce the chance of runs on financial institutions by providing the assurance of\nshort-term funding from the Fed based on an expanded range of collateral. Beyond these\nfacilities, the Fed has provided direct financing to prevent the outright bankruptcy of Bear\n10\n\nStearns and AIG, whose failure, in the judgment of the Fed and the Treasury, would have\nsignificantly undermined financial stability.\nEven though the Fed has done much to attack the financial crisis, more was\nobviously needed. A comprehensive solution requires actions that are “fiscal,” in the\nsense that they use taxpayer funds or place them at risk, and thus extend beyond the Fed’s\nlegislative mandate. The actions that have now been announced or implemented fall into\nthree main categories, corresponding to the three underlying problems in the financial\nsystem that I identified earlier: impaired assets, capital shortage, and uncertainty about\nshort-term funding. With respect to impaired assets, the Treasury is formulating plans to\npurchase mortgage-related assets from financial institutions. This could reduce\nuncertainty about the valuation of these instruments, restore some liquidity in the\nsecondary markets, and improve capital positions if the actual purchase prices exceed the\nfire-sale levels that now prevail for many asset-backed securities. The second problem\nafflicting the financial sector—capital shortage—is critical. It is therefore extremely\nheartening that the governments of all countries involved in the crisis have announced\nimmediate plans to inject capital into their financial systems. With respect to short-term\nfunding, direct government guarantees against default have been extended on an\nemergency basis to boost public confidence in lending to financial institutions. The\nguarantees cover most deposits as well as newly issued senior debt.\nI believe that these steps are extremely constructive and will help over time to\nease some of the wariness about counterparty risk and thaw credit flows. So far, we’ve\nseen very tentative signs of an easing of stress in money markets. For example, LIBOR-\nOIS and credit default swap spreads are down somewhat. However these spreads remain\n11\n\nat levels that are well above normal and other measures of stress have risen even further.\nClearly, we have a long way to go before the credit crunch shows significant healing. So\nit is worth considering other types of policies to address the crisis.\nFor example, several programs to mitigate the problem of foreclosures and the\ncredit losses precipitated by falling house prices are either in effect or have been\nproposed. They fall into two broad categories: those aimed more or less directly at\nreducing the number of foreclosures by focusing mainly on helping homeowners who are\nat risk of losing their homes, and those designed to reduce borrowing costs for a much\nwider population, thereby supporting the overall demand for housing and, hence, house\nprices.\nIn the first category is the HOPE NOW Alliance, a voluntary program that started\nin October 2007 which brings together counselors, servicers, investors, and other\nmortgage market participants. It facilitates the reworking of mortgage loans by\nmarshalling the incentives of lenders and borrowers to avoid the deadweight losses\nassociated with foreclosures. A second example is HOPE for Homeowners, a federal\nprogram resulting from legislation sponsored by U.S. Congressman Frank and Senator\nDodd. This program went into operation at the beginning of this month. It expands the\nrole of the FHA to improve loan “workout options” by providing a government guarantee\nof payment to lenders. In return, lenders must forgive a portion of the principal to make\nthe new loan more affordable. In addition, the program includes a shared-appreciation\nfeature in which the FHA and homeowner divide both the equity created at the beginning\nof the new mortgage loan and any future house-price appreciation.\n12\n\nMoreover, expanded versions of such workout approaches have been proposed.\nIn particular, FDIC Chairwoman Sheila Bair has suggested guidelines to target and\nstreamline the loan modification process. She also proposes using loan guarantees\nauthorized by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act as an incentive for servicers to\nlower mortgage payments so as to make them affordable and sustainable.4 Other\nproposals are modeled on the Homeowners’ Loan Corporation instituted in the Great\nDepression.5 The basic idea is that the government would offer to buy under-water\nloans—now about 15 percent of total mortgages—from lenders and refinance a new\nmortgage for qualifying homeowners at a lower rate.\nPrograms like these are targeted at borrowers who are already or are likely to end\nup in foreclosure. They have the potential to keep qualifying homeowners in their homes\nwith sustainable mortgages, thus avoiding the deadweight losses and negative community\nspillovers of foreclosure. By mitigating foreclosure sales at fire-sale prices, these\nprograms may also support housing prices more generally and serve to limit the credit\nlosses that have done so much damage to the financial system. The broader the debt-\nrelief that a plan provides to households, the more it is apt to spur consumer spending and\nreduce credit losses; but the cost to taxpayers is likely to increase as well. Speed of\nimplementation is another key consideration, and loan modification plans that involve\n4 Sheila C.

Yellen\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nAt the\nMoney Marketeers of New York University\nNew York, New York\nApril 11, 2012\n\nI appreciate the opportunity to speak with you this evening. The Money\nMarketeers are renowned for their keen interest in the economy and monetary policy.\nWith that in mind, I’ll describe how my views concerning the stance of monetary policy\nrelate to my assessment of the economic outlook. As you know, the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC) issued statements following its January and March meetings\nindicating that it “currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of\nresource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely\nto warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014.”\nI agreed with those judgments and, in my remarks tonight, I’ll explain my views and\ndescribe some of the analytical tools that I use in making such policy decisions. I will\nalso discuss the conditional nature of the Committee’s policy stance. Let me emphasize\nat the outset that the remainder of my remarks reflect my own views and not those of\nothers in the Federal Reserve System.1\nThe Labor Market and the Economic Outlook\nI will start by describing current conditions and key features of the economic\noutlook that influence my views on the appropriate stance of monetary policy. To\nsummarize, the labor market has shown welcome signs of improvement. Even so, the\neconomy remains far from full employment. Furthermore, the improvement in labor\nmarket conditions has outpaced the seemingly moderate growth of output. Looking\nahead, significant headwinds are likely to continue to restrain aggregate spending, and\nprogress in closing the remaining employment gap is likely to be quite gradual. Apart\n1 I appreciate assistance from members of the Board staff--James Clouse, William English, Michael Leahy,\nDavid Lebow, Andrew Levin, Andrea Lowe, Steven Meyer, and David Reifschneider--who contributed to\nthe preparation of these remarks.\n\n- 2 -\nfrom sizable increases in gasoline prices, inflation has been subdued in recent months.\nWhile the jump in energy prices is pushing up inflation temporarily, I anticipate that\nsubsequently inflation will run at or below the Committee’s 2 percent objective for the\nforeseeable future. Let’s examine the economic outlook in greater detail before\nconsidering how that outlook shapes my views on appropriate policy.\nStarting with the labor market, as I mentioned, there have been encouraging signs\nof improvement in recent months. The unemployment rate had hovered around 9 percent\nfor much of last year but moved down in the fall and averaged 8-1/4 percent in the first\nthree months of this year, about 1-3/4 percentage points lower than its peak during the\nrecession. And even though the latest employment report was somewhat disappointing,\nprivate sector payrolls expanded, on average, by about 210,000 per month in the first\nquarter, up from gains averaging around 150,000 per month during most of 2011. Other\nlabor market indicators have shown similar improvement.\nThis news is certainly welcome, yet it must be kept in perspective. Our economy\nis recovering from the steepest and most prolonged economic downturn since the 1930s,\nand these job gains still leave us far short of where we need to be. The level of private\npayrolls remains nearly 5 million below its pre-recession peak, and the unemployment\nrate stands well above levels that I, and most analysts, judge as normal over the longer\nrun.\nFigure 1 shows the unemployment rate together with the outlook of professional\nforecasters from last month’s Blue Chip survey.2 The solid blue line shows the Blue\n2 The Blue Chip survey provides forecasts on a quarterly basis only through the end of 2013. To construct\nquarterly forecasts for 2014, we interpolate the annual projections reported in the March survey. According\n\n- 3 -\nChip consensus and the blue shading denotes the range between the top 10 and bottom 10\nprojections of forecasters in the March Blue Chip survey. The figure also shows the\ncentral tendency of the unemployment projections that my FOMC colleagues and I made\nat our January meeting: Those projections reflect our assessments of the economic\noutlook given our own individual judgments about the appropriate path of monetary\npolicy. As in the Blue Chip consensus outlook, FOMC participants’ projections indicate\nthat unemployment will decline gradually from current levels. Included in the figure as\nwell is the central tendency of FOMC participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal\nunemployment rate, which ranges from 5.2 percent to 6 percent. The unemployment rate\nis expected to remain well above its longer-run normal value over the next several years.\nAs you know, economic forecasts always entail considerable uncertainty.\nFigure 2 illustrates the degree of uncertainty surrounding projections of unemployment.\nThe gray shading denotes a model-based 70 percent confidence interval for the\nunemployment rate, based on the sorts of shocks that have hit the economy over the past\n40 years.3 Judging from historical experience, the consensus projection could be quite far\noff, in either direction. That said, the figure also shows that labor market slack at present\nis so large that even a very large and favorable forecast error would not change the\nconclusion that slack will likely remain substantial for quite some time.\nto the April edition of the Blue Chip survey, which was released yesterday, “The consensus outlook for\nU.S. economic growth this year and next underwent minimal change over the past month.”\n3 The forecast confidence interval is generated using stochastic simulations of the Federal Reserve staff’s\nFRB/US model. Specifically, a baseline is constructed centered on the midpoint of the central tendency of\nthe FOMC’s projections released in January, and then the model is repeatedly simulated with shocks drawn\nrandomly for the set of historical disturbances experienced over the period from 1968 to 2011. Similar\nestimates of forecast confidence intervals would be obtained if the intervals were instead constructed using\nthe actual historical forecasting errors of private forecasters; for further discussion, see Table 2 of the\nFOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections.\n\n- 4 -\nSome observers question just how large the shortfall from full employment really\nis and hence worry that further increases in aggregate demand could push up inflation.\nTheir concern is that a large part of the rise in unemployment since 2007 is structural\nrather than cyclical. I agree that the magnitude of structural unemployment is uncertain,\nbut I read the evidence as supporting the view that the bulk of the rise in unemployment\nthat we saw in recent years was cyclical, not structural in nature. Assessments\nconcerning the degree of slack in the labor market are highly relevant to an evaluation of\nthe appropriate stance of policy, so I’d like to review my reasoning in some detail.\nFirst, the fact that the rise in unemployment was quite widespread across industry\nand occupation groups casts doubt on the hypothesis that there has been an unusually\nlarge mismatch between the types of job vacancies and the types of workers available to\nfill them. Certainly, job losses in the construction sector and in financial services were\nparticularly sharp--not surprising given the collapse in the housing market and in the\nfinancial sector that we saw in 2008--but so were losses in manufacturing and other\nhighly cyclical industries that typically are hit especially hard in recessions. Indeed,\nmeasures of the dispersion of employment changes across industries did not increase\nmore than past experience would have predicted given the depth of the recession.\nSome commentators have noted that “house lock”--the reluctance or inability of\nhomeowners to sell in a declining price environment or when underwater on their\nmortgages--may be preventing people from moving to find available jobs in new\nlocations. However, evidence from migration patterns suggests that house lock is not\nhaving a significant effect on the level of structural unemployment. While migration\nwithin the United States has been trending down for some time, the reduction in mobility\n\n- 5 -\nduring the recession was not greater for homeowners than for renters, nor was it\nespecially pronounced for areas where housing prices have declined the most and so\nwhere house lock would likely be most prevalent.4\nFinally, I do not interpret data suggesting an outward shift in the Beveridge curve\nas providing much evidence in favor of an increase in structural unemployment. The\nBeveridge curve plots the relationship between unemployment and job vacancies.\nCyclical variations in aggregate demand tend to move unemployment and job vacancies\nin opposite directions, whereas structural shifts would be expected to move vacancies and\nunemployment in the same direction. For instance, a structural mismatch between\nbusinesses’ hiring needs and the skills of unemployed workers would tend to push up the\nlevel of vacancies for a given level of unemployment. Figure 3 plots the co-movement of\nunemployment and job vacancy rates since 2007.5 Consistent with a substantial decline\nin aggregate demand, followed by some modest recovery, movements in unemployment\nand vacancies since 2007 display a predominantly inverse relationship. However, figure\n3 shows that as job vacancies have risen during the recovery, unemployment has declined\nby less than might have been expected based on the relationship that prevailed during the\ncontraction. This outcome has led some to suggest that the Beveridge curve has shifted\noutward, reflecting an increase in the extent of job mismatch. In my view, a portion of\nthis apparent outward shift in the Beveridge curve reflects increases in the maximum\nduration of unemployment benefits, which have been important in buffering the effects of\n4 See Raven Molloy, Christopher L. Smith, and Abigail Wozniak (2011), “Internal Migration in the United\nStates,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2011-30 (Washington: Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System, May), www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2011/201130/201130pap.pdf.\n5 The measure of job vacancies shown in figure 3 is derived from indexes of help-wanted advertising\npublished by the Conference Board. Print and online indexes are combined as in Regis Barnichon (2010),\n“Building a Composite Help-Wanted Index,” Economics Letters, vol. 109 (December), pp. 175-78.\n\n- 6 -\nthe weak labor market on workers and their families. The influence of these benefits will\ndissipate as they are phased out and the economy recovers. In addition, loop-like\nmovements around the Beveridge curve are common during recoveries. Vacancies\ntypically adjust more quickly than unemployment to changes in labor demand, causing\ncounterclockwise movements in vacancy-unemployment space that can look like shifts in\nthe Beveridge curve. Figure 4 plots the relationship seen during and after the 1973 and\n1982 recessions alongside the current episode. As can be seen, such counterclockwise\nmovements also occurred during these two earlier deep recessions.6\nWhile I do not see much evidence of any significant increase in structural\nunemployment so far, I am concerned that structural unemployment could increase over\ntime if the labor market heals too slowly--a phenomenon known as hysteresis. An\nexceptionally large fraction of those now unemployed--more than 40 percent--have been\nout of work for six months or more. My concern is that individuals with such long\nunemployment spells could become less employable as their skills deteriorate and as they\nlose their connections to the labor market. This outcome does not appear to have\noccurred in the wake of previous U.S. recessions, but the fraction of the unemployed who\nhave been out of work for a long period is much higher now than it has been in the past.\nTo date, I have not seen evidence that hysteresis is occurring to any substantial degree.\nFor example, the probability of finding a new job has not deteriorated more for\nindividuals experiencing a long-term bout of unemployment relative to those facing\n6 See John Lindner and Murat Tasci (2010), “Has the Beveridge Curve Shifted?” Economic Trends\n(Cleveland: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, August),\nwww.clevelandfed.org/research/trends/2010/0810/02labmar.cfm; and Rob Valletta and Katherine Kuang\n(2010), “Is Structural Unemployment on the Rise?” FRBSF Economic Letter 2010-34 (San Francisco:\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, November),\nwww.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2010/el2010-34.html.\n\n- 7 -\nshorter spells. Nonetheless, the risk that continued high unemployment could eventually\nlead to more-persistent structural problems underscores the case for maintaining a highly\naccommodative stance of monetary policy.\nPutting all the evidence together, I see no good reason to doubt that our nation’s\nhigh unemployment rate indicates a substantial degree of slack in the labor market.\nMoreover, while I recognize the significant uncertainty surrounding such forecasts, I\nanticipate that growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) will be sufficient to lower\nunemployment only gradually from this point forward, in part because substantial\nheadwinds continue to restrain the recovery.\nOne headwind comes from the housing sector, which has typically been a driver\nof business cycle recoveries. We have seen some improvement recently, but demand for\nhousing is likely to pick up only gradually given still-elevated unemployment,\nuncertainties over the direction of house prices, and mortgage credit availability that\nseems likely to remain very restricted for all but the most creditworthy buyers. When\nhousing demand does pick up more noticeably, the huge overhang of both unoccupied\ndwellings and homes in the foreclosure pipeline will likely allow demand to be met for a\ntime without a sizable expansion in homebuilding.\nA second headwind comes from fiscal policy. State and local governments\ncontinue to face extremely tight budget situations in light of the weak economy,\ndepressed home prices, and the phasing out of federal stimulus grants, though overall tax\nrevenues have been improving and that should continue as the economy expands further.\nAt the federal level, stimulus-related policies are scheduled to wind down, while both real\n\n- 8 -\ndefense and nondefense purchases are expected to decline over the next several years\nunder the spending caps put in place last year.\nA third factor weighing on the outlook is the sluggish pace of economic growth\nabroad. Strains in global financial markets have eased somewhat since late last year, an\nimprovement that reflects in part policy actions taken by European authorities.\nNonetheless, risk premiums on sovereign debt and other securities are still elevated in\nmany European countries, while European banks continue to face pressure to shrink their\nbalance sheets, and concerns about the outlook for the region remain. A further\nslowdown in economic activity in Europe and in other foreign economies would inhibit\nU.S. export growth.\nFor these reasons, I anticipate that the U.S. economy will continue to recover only\ngradually and that labor market slack will remain substantial for a number of years to\ncome.\nOne consideration that further complicates this outlook is the inconsistency\nbetween recent movements in economic growth and employment: Unemployment has\ndeclined significantly over the past year even though growth appears to have been only\nmoderate. This unanticipated decline in the unemployment rate presents something of a\npuzzle, and it creates uncertainties for the outlook and policy.\nTo illustrate this puzzle, figure 5 plots changes in the unemployment rate against\nreal GDP growth--a simple portrayal of the relationship known as Okun’s law. It is\nevident from the figure that 2011 is something of an outlier, with the drop in the\nunemployment rate last year much larger than would seem consistent with real GDP\ngrowth below 2 percent. One possibility, highlighted by Chairman Bernanke in a recent\n\n- 9 -\nspeech, is that last year’s decline in unemployment represents a catch-up from the\nespecially large job losses during late 2008 and 2009.7 According to this hypothesis,\nemployers slashed employment especially sharply during the recession, perhaps out of\nconcern that the contraction could become even more severe; in particular, the figure\nshows that in 2009, the unemployment rate rose by considerably more than the decline in\nGDP would have suggested. Then, last year, employers may have become confident\nenough in the recovery to increase hiring and relieve the unsustainable strain that the\nearlier cutbacks had placed on their workforces. I think the evidence is consistent with\nthis hypothesis, and I have incorporated it into my own modal forecast.\nIf last year’s Okun’s law puzzle was largely the result of such a catch-up in hiring,\nI would expect progress on the unemployment front to diminish unless the pace of GDP\ngrowth picks up. After all, catch-up can go on for only so long. Of course, there are\nother conceivable explanations for this puzzle, including some that would point to a faster\ndecline in unemployment in coming years. For example, GDP could have risen more\nrapidly over the past year than current data indicate. It will be important to pay close\nattention to indicators of both the labor market and GDP to try to gauge the likely pace of\nimprovement in economic activity going forward and, hence, the appropriate stance of\nmonetary policy over time.\nLet me now turn to inflation. Overall consumer price inflation has fluctuated\nquite a bit in recent years, largely reflecting movements in prices for oil and other\ncommodities. For example, inflation moved up in the first part of 2011 as a rise in the\n7 See Ben S. Bernanke (2012), “Recent Developments in the Labor Market,” speech delivered at the\nNational Association for Business Economics Annual Conference, Washington, March 26,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20120326a.htm.\n\n- 10 -\nprice of oil and other commodities fed through to gasoline prices, and, to a lesser extent,\nto prices of other goods and services. Then inflation subsided after commodity prices\ncame off their peaks. More recently, prices of crude oil, and thus of gasoline, have turned\nup again. But smoothing through these fluctuations, inflation as measured by the\npersonal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index averaged 2 percent over the past\ntwo years. Using the price index excluding food and energy--another rough way to\nabstract from transitory fluctuations--inflation averaged about 1-1/2 percent over the past\ntwo years. These rates are lower than the inflation rates that were seen prior to the\nrecession, and they are at or below the FOMC’s long-run goal of 2 percent inflation.\nIn my view, the subdued inflation environment largely reflects two factors. First,\nthe substantial slack in the labor market has restrained inflation by holding down labor\ncosts. Second, and of critical importance, longer-term inflation expectations have been\nremarkably stable. Like many other observers, I was concerned that inflation\nexpectations might move lower during the recession, driving down both wages and prices\nin a self-reinforcing spiral. The Federal Reserve acted forcefully to resist such an\noutcome and, fortunately, that destructive dynamic did not take hold. Indeed, the\nstability of expectations has meant that the price increases driven by costs of oil and other\ncommodities have had only temporary effects on the rate of inflation. Although firms\npassed higher input costs into their prices when they could do so, those one-time price\nincreases have not led to an expectations-driven process that might have resulted in\npersistently higher inflation.\nThe same key factors that have kept core inflation subdued provide the rationale\nfor my inflation forecast. I anticipate that slack in the labor market will continue to\n\n- 11 -\nrestrain growth in labor costs and prices. And, given the stability of inflation\nexpectations, I expect that the latest round of gasoline price increases will also have only\na temporary effect on overall inflation. Indeed, if crude oil prices were to follow the\ndownward-sloping path implied by current futures contracts, energy costs would serve as\na restraining influence on overall inflation over the next several years. Figure 6 presents\nthe central tendency of FOMC participants’ projections of inflation at the time of our\nJanuary meeting. Most expected inflation to be at, or a bit below, our long-run objective\nof 2 percent through 2014; most private forecasters also appear to expect inflation by this\nmeasure to be close to 2 percent.8 As with unemployment, uncertainty around the\ninflation projection is substantial.\nBenchmarks for Assessing Monetary Policy: Optimal Control\nAs I indicated at the outset of my remarks, I supported the Committee’s\nstatements in January and March pertaining to the stance of monetary policy. I will now\nexplain the rationale for my judgments, and I will describe some of the tools that I use to\nmake such assessments. I consider it essential, in making judgments about the stance of\npolicy, to recognize at the outset the limits of our understanding regarding the dynamics\nof the economy and the transmission of monetary policy. Because I see no magic bullet\nfor determining the “right” stance of policy, I commonly consider a number of different\napproaches.\nOne approach I find helpful in judging an appropriate path for policy is based on\noptimal control techniques. Optimal control can be used, under certain assumptions, to\n8 The Blue Chip survey reports inflation forecasts for the consumer price index (CPI), not the PCE price\nindex. However, the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) provides forecasts for both inflation\nmeasures, and we use the projected spreads between the measures reported in the 2012Q1 release of the\nSPF (together with historical data) to convert the March Blue Chip CPI forecasts to a PCE basis.\n\n- 12 -\nobtain a prescription for the path of monetary policy conditional on a baseline forecast of\neconomic conditions. Optimal control typically involves the selection of a particular\nmodel to represent the dynamics of the economy as well as the specification of a “loss\nfunction” that represents the social costs of deviations of inflation from the Committee’s\nlonger-run goal and of deviations of unemployment from its longer-run normal rate. In\neffect, this approach assumes that the policymaker has perfect foresight about the\nevolution of the economy and that the private sector can fully anticipate the future path of\nmonetary policy; that is, the central bank’s plans are completely transparent and credible\nto the public.9\nTo show what an optimal control approach might have called for at the time of the\nJanuary FOMC meeting, figure 7 depicts a purely illustrative baseline outlook\nconstructed using the distribution of FOMC participants’ projections for unemployment,\ninflation, and the federal funds rate that we published in January. Here, the baseline\npaths for unemployment and inflation track the midpoint of the central tendency of the\nCommittee’s projections through 2014. The unemployment rate gradually converges to\naround 5-1/2 percent--roughly the midpoint of the central tendency of participants’ long-\nrun projections of these factors--and inflation converges to the Committee’s longer-run\ngoal of 2 percent. The baseline path for the funds rate stays near zero through late 2014\nand then rises steadily back to the long-run value expected by most participants. While\nthis path is consistent with the January and March statements, I hasten to add that both\n9 The assumption of perfect foresight or “certainty equivalence” is commonly used in practice but is not an\nintrinsic feature of optimal control techniques. Indeed, the fully optimal policy under uncertainty involves\nthe specification of a complete set of state-contingent policy paths.\n\n- 13 -\nthe assumed date of liftoff and the longer-run pace of tightening are merely illustrative\nand are not based on any internal FOMC deliberations.10\nGiven this baseline, one can then employ the dynamics of one of the Federal\nReserve’s economic models, the FRB/US model, to solve for the optimal funds rate path\nsubject to a particular loss function.11 Such a policy involves keeping the funds rate close\nto zero until late 2015. This highly accommodative policy path generates, according to\nthe FRB/US model, a notably faster reduction in unemployment than in the baseline\noutlook. In addition, the inflation rate runs close to the FOMC’s longer-run goal of 2\npercent over coming years. According to the specified loss function, and in my opinion,\nthis economic outcome would be more desirable than the baseline. One reason this\nexercise generates a better outcome is because it assumes that the Federal Reserve’s\ninflation objective is fully credible--that is, all households and businesses fully\nunderstand the Federal Reserve’s goals and believe that policymakers will follow the\noptimal policy designed to meet those goals. This belief ties down longer-term inflation\nexpectations in the model even while it allows the lower interest rate to spur faster\ngrowth in output and employment.\nWhile optimal control exercises can be informative, such analyses hinge on the\nselection of a specific macroeconomic model as well as a set of simplifying assumptions\nthat may be quite unrealistic. I therefore consider it imprudent to place too much weight\n10 In these simulations, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet is assumed to evolve in accordance with the\nexit strategy principles that the FOMC adopted at its June 2011 meeting.\n11 This procedure involves two steps. First, the FRB/US model’s projections of real activity, inflation, and\ninterest rates are adjusted to replicate the baseline forecast values reported in figure 7. Second, a search\nprocedure is used to solve for the path of the federal funds rate that minimizes the value of a loss function.\nThe loss function is equal to the cumulative sum from 2012:Q2 through 2025:Q4 of three factors--the\n(discounted) squared deviation of the unemployment rate from 5-1/2 percent, the squared deviation of\noverall PCE inflation from 2 percent, and the squared quarterly change in the federal funds rate. The third\nterm is added to damp quarter-to-quarter movements in interest rates.\n\n- 14 -\non the policy prescriptions obtained from these methods, so I simultaneously consider\nother approaches for gauging the appropriate stance of monetary policy.\nAlternative Benchmarks for Monetary Policy: Simple Rules\nAn alternative approach that I find helpful in evaluating the stance of policy is to\nconsult prescriptions from simple policy rules. Research suggests that these rules\nperform well in a variety of models and tend to be more robust than the optimal control\npolicy derived from any single macroeconomic model.12 Of course, a wide variety of\nsimple rules have been proposed in the academic literature, and their policy implications\ncan differ significantly depending on the particular specification. Moreover, given our\nstatutory mandate of maximum employment and price stability, it seems reasonable to\nfocus on rules that mirror these two objectives by prescribing how the federal funds rate\nshould be adjusted in response to two gaps: the deviation of inflation from its longer-run\ngoal and the deviation of unemployment from my estimate of its longer-run normal rate.\nIn my view, rules specified along these lines can serve as useful benchmarks for gauging\nthe stance of policy and for communicating with the public about the rationale for our\npolicy decisions.\nIndeed, in the statement on longer-run goals and policy strategy that the FOMC\nissued in January, we underscored our commitment to following a “balanced approach”\nin promoting our dual objectives. The commitment to a balanced approach has crucial\nimplications when it comes to choosing sensible benchmarks from among the many\nalternative policy rules. In particular, any benchmark rule should conform to the so-\n12 See the discussion in John B. Taylor and John C. Williams (2011), “Simple and Robust Rules for\nMonetary Policy,” in Benjamin M.

Moreover, I think it is essential that policy rules incorporate a\nsufficiently strong response to resource slack, typically either the output gap or the\nunemployment gap, to help bring the economy back toward full employment\nexpeditiously.\nJohn Taylor has proposed two simple and well-known policy rules along these\nlines. The rule that Taylor proposed in 1993 incorporates a fairly modest response to\neconomic slack. Later, in a 1999 study, he considered a variant of that rule that was\ntwice as responsive to slack.13 Taylor himself continues to prefer his original rule, which\nI will refer to as the Taylor (1993) rule. In my view, however, the later variant--which I\nwill refer to as the Taylor (1999) rule--is more consistent with following a balanced\napproach to promoting our dual mandate. Importantly, because of the stabilizing effects\nof the Taylor principle, both the Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules imply that\ninflation returns over time to the longer-run goal of 2 percent.14\n13 See John B. Taylor (1993), “Discretion versus Policy Rules in Practice,” Carnegie-Rochester Conference\nSeries on Public Policy, vol. 39 (December), pp. 195-214,\nwww.stanford.edu/~johntayl/Onlinepaperscombinedbyyear/1993/Discretion_versus_Policy_Rules_in_Pract\nice.pdf ; and John B. Taylor (1999), “A Historical Analysis of Monetary Policy Rules,” in John B. Taylor,\ned., Monetary Policy Rules, (Chicago: University of Chicago Press), pp. 319-341,\nwww.stanford.edu/~johntayl/Onlinepaperscombinedbyyear/1999/An_Historical_Analysis_of_Monetary_P\nolicy_Rules.pdf.\n14 The intercept term in each rule reflects the assumption of a constant value of 2 percent for the\nequilibrium real federal funds rate. Thus, if the economy’s true equilibrium real funds rate deviated\nsystematically from that value, the intercept term would need to be adjusted to ensure that the inflation rate\nconverged over time to its longer-run goal.\n\n- 16 -\nFigure 8 shows the projected paths for the federal funds rate called for by these\ntwo policy rules, along with the optimal control path that I presented earlier.15 These\nprojections are constructed using the FRB/US model, conditioned on the same illustrative\nbaseline outlook that I used a moment ago. The Taylor (1993) rule calls for the federal\nfunds rate to begin rising in early 2013, whereas the Taylor (1999) rule has its liftoff in\nearly 2015, a lot closer to the optimal control path. A sizable literature has examined the\nperformance of simple rules like these by conducting stochastic simulations with a range\nof economic models. Many studies, including Taylor’s own analysis, suggest that the\nTaylor (1999) rule generates considerably less variability in real activity and only slightly\nmore variability in inflation than his original rule.16 Given the differential responses to\neconomic slack across these two rules, this finding is hardly surprising, but it is a key\nreason why I consider the Taylor (1999) rule to be a more suitable guide for Fed policy.\nWhile the Taylor (1999) rule can serve as a useful policy benchmark, its\nprescriptions fail to take into account some considerations that I consider important in the\ncurrent context. In particular, this rule does not fully take into account the implications\nof the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates and hence tends to understate the\nrationale for maintaining a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy under\npresent circumstances.\n15 In these simulations, the Taylor (1993) rule is defined as R = 2 + π + 0.5(π - 2) + 0.5Y, while the Taylor\nt t t t\n(1999) rule is defined as R = 2 + π + 0.5(π - 2) + 1.0Y. In these expressions, R is the federal funds rate, π\nt t t t\nis the percent change in the headline PCE price index from four quarters earlier, and Y is the output gap.\nThe output gap in turn is approximated using Okun’s law; specifically, Y = 2.3(5.6-U), where 2.3 is the\nt t\nestimated value of the Okun’s law coefficient and 5.6 is the assumed value of the non-accelerating inflation\nrate of unemployment, or NAIRU.\n16 See John B. Taylor (1999), “Introduction,” in John B. Taylor, ed., Monetary Policy Rules (Chicago:\nUniversity of Chicago Press), pp. 1-14,\nwww.stanford.edu/~johntayl/Onlinepaperscombinedbyyear/1999/Introductory_Remarks_on_Monetary_Pol\nicy_Rules.pdf.\n\n- 17 -\nImportantly, resource utilization rates have been so low since late 2008 that a\nvariety of simple rules have been calling for a federal funds rate substantially below zero,\nwhich of course is not possible. Consequently, the actual setting of the target funds rate\nhas been persistently tighter than such rules would have recommended. The FOMC’s\nunconventional policy actions--including our large-scale asset purchase programs--have\nsurely helped fill this “policy gap” but, in my judgment, have not entirely compensated\nfor the zero-bound constraint on conventional policy. In effect, there has been a\nsignificant shortfall in the overall amount of monetary policy stimulus since early 2009\nrelative to the prescriptions of the simple rules that I’ve described.\nAnalysis by some of my Federal Reserve colleagues suggests that monetary\npolicy can produce better economic outcomes if it commits to making up for at least\nsome portion of the cumulative shortfall created by the zero lower bound--namely, by\nmaintaining a highly accommodative monetary policy for longer than a simple rule would\notherwise prescribe.17 This consideration is one important reason that the optimal control\nsimulation generates a more accommodative path than the Taylor (1999) rule.\nRisk-management considerations strengthen the case for maintaining a highly\naccommodative policy stance longer than might otherwise be considered appropriate. In\nparticular, the FOMC has considerable latitude to withdraw policy accommodation if the\neconomic recovery were to proceed much faster than expected or if inflation were to\ncome in higher. In contrast, if the recovery faltered or inflation drifted down, the\nCommittee could provide additional stimulus using its unconventional tools, but doing so\ninvolves costs and risks. Given the unprecedented nature of the current economic\n17 See David Reifschneider and John C. Willams (2000), “Three Lessons for Monetary Policy in a Low-\nInflation Era,” Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking, vol. 32 (November), pp. 936-66.\n\n- 18 -\nsituation and the limits placed on conventional policy by the zero lower bound on interest\nrates, these issues of risk management take on special importance.\nMore broadly, these considerations help illustrate why it would be imprudent to\nadhere mechanistically to the prescriptions of any single policy rule. Such rules can\nserve as useful benchmarks for facilitating monetary policy deliberations and\ncommunications, but a dose of good judgment will always be essential as well.\nUncertainty and Policy Conditionality\nThe policy prescriptions I’ve discussed thus far are conditioned on an illustrative\nbaseline forecast for unemployment and inflation. Because any economic forecast is\ninherently uncertain, the FOMC’s forward policy guidance states explicitly that the\nCommittee “currently anticipates” that economic conditions are likely to warrant such a\nstance of policy. The guidance does not state that the Committee will keep the funds rate\nexceptionally low until at least late 2014. I’d consider it completely appropriate to\nmodify the specification of the forward guidance in response to significant changes in the\neconomic outlook.\nPotential modifications of the forward guidance can be illustrated by showing\nhow the Taylor (1999) rule responds to two different shifts in the outlook. Figure 9\nshows one scenario in which the recovery turns out to be unexpectedly strong, with the\nunemployment rate reaching 6 percent by the end of 2014 and inflation moving a little\nabove 2 percent later in the decade. It also shows a second scenario in which the\nrecovery is unexpectedly weak, with the unemployment rate remaining above 8 percent\nuntil early 2014. In this scenario, inflation stays persistently below 2 percent. In the\nstronger scenario, the Taylor (1999) rule calls for the liftoff from the zero lower bound to\n\n- 19 -\nmove forward to the beginning of 2014. In that event, of course, the FOMC would not\nonly raise the federal funds rate sooner than our current guidance suggests but would also\nbegin to remove other forms of accommodation and draw down the balance sheet sooner\nthan in the baseline. In contrast, in the weaker scenario, the Taylor (1999) rule calls for\nthe liftoff to be delayed until the first half of 2016. The model’s recommendation for a\nlater liftoff in this scenario could alternatively provide an argument for additional policy\naccommodation through other means, including additional asset purchases.\nThe current economic outlook is associated with significant risks in both\ndirections. In particular, we know that recoveries from financial crises are commonly\nprolonged, and I remain concerned that the headwinds that have been restraining the\nrecovery could lead to a longer period of sluggish growth and high unemployment than is\nembodied in the consensus forecasts. One specific risk is that elevated uncertainty about\nprospective fiscal policy adjustments could weigh on the spending plans of households\nand businesses. In addition, it’s conceivable that the European situation could deteriorate\nand prompt a significant increase in global financial market stress. Such developments\nwould likely have substantial adverse effects on U.S. economic activity and inflation.\nPotential upside surprises to the outlook include the possibility that the recovery\nhas greater underlying momentum than is incorporated in consensus forecasts. As I\nnoted, the decline we’ve seen in the unemployment rate could conceivably indicate that\nGDP has been rising significantly faster than now estimated. Alternatively, the\n\n- 20 -\neconomy’s productive potential could be less than I judge, in which case inflationary\npressures could emerge sooner than I expect.18\nConclusion\nIn summary, I expect the economic recovery to continue--indeed, to strengthen\nsomewhat over time. Even so, over the next several years, I anticipate that we will fall\nfar short in achieving our maximum employment objective, and I expect inflation to\nremain at or below the FOMC’s longer-run goal of 2 percent. A range of considerations,\nincluding those relating to uncertainty and asymmetric risks, must inform one’s judgment\non the appropriate stance of policy. As I explained, a variety of analytical tools,\nincluding optimal control techniques and simple policy rules, can serve as useful\nbenchmarks. Based on such analysis, I consider a highly accommodative policy stance to\nbe appropriate in present circumstances. But considerable uncertainty surrounds the\noutlook, and I remain prepared to adjust my policy views in response to incoming\ninformation. In particular, further easing actions could be warranted if the recovery\nproceeds at a slower-than-expected pace, while a significant acceleration in the pace of\nrecovery could call for an earlier beginning to the process of policy firming than the\nFOMC currently anticipates.\n18 There is also some risk of significantly higher oil prices due to geopolitical events. Such a shock would\nhave ambiguous implications for monetary policy because, on the one hand, the contractionary effect of\nhigher oil prices on output and unemployment argues for greater accommodation, while, on the other hand,\nthe upward effect on inflation would argue for less. In my view, as long as inflation expectations remain\nwell anchored, then any higher inflation would be transitory--as proved to be the case last year--and the\nappropriate balance in fulfilling our dual mandate would likely imply little change in the path of short-term\nnominal rates, in part because such a policy response would cause real interest rates to be somewhat lower\nfor a time and thereby provide additional policy accommodation. Once again, then, the role of inflation\nexpectations remains of central importance to the proper stance of policy.\n\nUnemployment Rate\nRange between the top 10 and Percent\n10 bottom 10 Blue Chip projections 10\nFOMC central\ntendency\n9 9\nBlue Chip consensus\n8 8\n7 7\n6 6\nFOMC central tendency for\nlonger-run unemployment rate\n5 5\n4 4\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014\nSource: U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics; Blue Chip survey; Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nprojections.

    "text": "Speech to the Chartered Financial Analyst Institute, Annual Conference\nVancouver Convention and Exhibition Centre, British Columbia\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on May 13, 2008, 10:00 AM Pacific time, 1:00 PM Eastern\nCredit, Housing, Commodities, and the Economy1\nGood morning. I’m delighted to be part of the CFA’s annual conference this year.\nI’d like to thank the organizers for inviting me and for giving me an opportunity to talk\nabout the U.S. economy and the conduct of monetary policy to such a large and\nknowledgeable group of professionals. Most, if not all, of you have been first-hand\nwitnesses to one of the most significant economic shocks in our memories—one that is\nseriously affecting the U.S. outlook. I mean, of course, the events that have been roiling\nU.S. and global financial markets since midsummer of last year and that have led to the\ncurrent credit crunch.\nIn my assessment of the economy, I will also focus on two additional factors that\nare shaping the outlook—the downturn in housing markets and the unanticipated surge in\nfood, oil, and other commodity prices. These developments have taken a toll on the U.S.\neconomy, resulting in very weak performance for the past two quarters. To preview my\ndiscussion, I expect that the economy’s performance will improve somewhat in the\nsecond half of the year. But I am also well aware that the risks surrounding my forecast\nare unusually large because of uncertainty about how these three factors—the financial\nturmoil, the housing cycle, and commodity prices—will evolve. Before I begin, let me\n1 I am deeply indebted to staff in the Economic Research Department of the Federal Reserve Bank of San\nFrancisco, and in particular to John Judd and Judith Goff, for their support in preparing these remarks and\nto Laurie Glapa for outstanding research assistance.\n\nnote, as usual, that these remarks reflect my own views and not necessarily those of my\ncolleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nFinancial Markets and the Credit Crunch\nLet me turn first to the financial market turmoil. From a monetary policy\nperspective, one of its most important consequences is the serious credit crunch that has\ndeveloped. Stories about the credit crunch are in the news every day, and they highlight\nhow widespread its effects are. Students are finding it harder to obtain college loans.\nHouseholds are more often receiving notice that their home equity lines have been\ncapped. Companies report that it is more challenging to secure credit lines from their\nbanks. Some municipal governments and nonprofits have experienced unexpected jumps\nin interest payments on their debt due to disruptions in their funding markets.\nHomeowners seeking jumbo mortgages face interest rates that have risen since last\nsummer, even though both short- and long-term Treasury rates have declined\nsubstantially. And subprime mortgages are all but unavailable at any price.\nHow did such a situation come about? To my mind, it represents a rapid and\ndisruptive unwinding of a bubble-like situation that had developed in credit markets over\na number of years. At the time, many observers noted that the world appeared to be\n“awash in liquidity.” The “bubble” was characterized by very low long-term real interest\nrates. Investors seemed willing to accept very modest compensation for the risks they\nwere taking. The abundance of liquidity was reflected in a number of investment\nstrategies. For example, a wave of leveraged buyouts was financed at low interest rates\nwith exceptionally favorable terms. Substantial quantities of funds were also attracted\n2\n\ninto so-called “carry trades” involving exposure to significant exchange rate risk. And,\nmost importantly, there was a rapid rise in lending on home mortgages in general, and\nimportantly, in the subprime mortgage market, reflecting an exceptionally benign view of\nthe underlying risks.\nThis benign view may well have been linked, in part, to rapid transformations\ntaking place in our financial system. Securitization and financial engineering\nfundamentally changed financial markets in a relatively short period of time, appearing to\nmake it possible to slice and dice and spread risk more effectively—indeed, it appeared\nthat these innovations had made the usual terms of the risk-return tradeoff more\nfavorable.2 The surge in lending occurred as securitization promulgated the originate-to-\ndistribute business model—that is, underlying loans were securitized and sold to\ninvestors. Notably, the main compensation of many participants in the securitization\nchain came in the form of upfront origination fees. Without the strong incentives to\nmaintain underwriting standards that exist when originating institutions keep loans on\ntheir own books, the credit quality of many of the securitized loans deteriorated\nsignificantly. Subprime mortgages are a good example, as combined loan-to-value ratios\nand the percentage of low- or “no-doc” loans rose steadily through 2006. And, in any\ncase, even subprime mortgages looked like a good bet, with house prices seeming to be\non an ever-upward march.\nFurthermore, with the economy booming, investors, including highly leveraged\ninvestment banks, hedge funds, and SIVs (structured investment vehicles)—the so-called\n“shadow banking sector”—were actively seeking projects to finance and willing to\nincrease their leverage. With interest rates so low, they were motivated to reach for\n2 Rajan (2008)\n3\n\nhigher yields on these projects.3 Many investors found reassurance in getting involved in\nmany of these complex securities by relying on the evaluations given by rating agencies.\nUnfortunately, these ratings turned out not to be very reliable.\nSo long as house prices kept soaring, as they did until a couple of years ago, these\ncredit problems did not show up. But once house prices flattened out and then began to\nfall, it became clear that delinquencies and foreclosures on subprime and other mortgages\nwould be far higher than had been anticipated. This arguably was the trigger of a far\nbroader reappraisal of credit market risks and attitudes.\nClearly, the market discipline that “sophisticated investors” are supposed to\nprovide was lacking. As we saw, even some of the largest, most sophisticated financial\ninstitutions inadequately incorporated into their risk-management models the full range of\nhazards entailed in the originate-to-distribute business and the liquidity risks that would\nresult from a drying up of short-term funding. Also lacking were reliable ratings from the\nagencies. But financial supervisors and regulators, including the Federal Reserve, were\nbehind the curve, as well. We missed some of the risky developments that were\nunfolding. Our consumer regulations were unfortunately insufficient to protect\nhouseholds from some egregious and unfair lending practices. And we took too long to\nramp up some supervisory policies in the face of mounting risks. On a broader level, the\nsituation exposed holes in the existing regulatory framework for financial services, which\nallowed some risky activities to flourish, hurting both consumers and financial stability.\nSignificantly, the Fed was compelled to open the discount window to investment banks\nbecause of the outsized risks some took and their significant interconnectedness with the\n3 Adrian and Shin (2008)\n4\n\nfinancial market infrastructure. Investment banks thus were able to operate with less\ncapital and supervision than such access otherwise entails.\nNow that I’ve taken a broad view of the crisis, let me go into some of the more\nspecific developments that influence my views on the economy and monetary policy.\nGiven the importance of the subprime market in initiating the crisis and its relevance to\nthe broader housing market, I would like to spend a few minutes at the outset reviewing\nwhat happened there before returning to the main “story line” concerning the financial\nturmoil. This market took off after 2001 and, by one estimate, in late 2007 there were\nover 7 million subprime mortgages outstanding, or about 14 percent of the overall\nmortgage market. Through late 2005, things seemed to be going well, with subprime\ndelinquencies remarkably low in most areas of the country. But now, close to 20 percent\nof subprime mortgages are delinquent or in foreclosure nationwide.\nResearch suggests that it was not so much interest rate resets that triggered the\nrise in subprime problems, as many expected. Indeed, reductions in short-term interest\nrates since the onset of the crisis should diminish the danger of foreclosures from such\nresets going forward. Rather, the single most important determinant of the level and\nchange in subprime delinquency rates has been the pace of house price changes.4\nThe link between house prices and delinquency rates is not surprising. Although\ndelinquencies and foreclosures are often precipitated by life crises, such as illness,\ndivorce, or the loss of a job, the amount of equity in the home affects the ability or\nwillingness of a homeowner to keep current on their mortgage payments when these\nevents occur. In a market in which house prices have been stagnant or declining, a\n4 Doms, Furlong, and Krainer (2007a, b), Demyanyk and van Hemert (2008), Gerardi, Shapiro, and Willen\n(2007), and FRBSF 2007 Annual Report (2008).\n5\n\nborrower with a recent mortgage secured with little or no down payment does not have\nthe flexibility to refinance or to tap into the equity in the house to weather a life event.\nEven some borrowers who might be able to afford their loans may be unwilling to make\nthe payments if house prices are expected to remain low or decline putting their\nmortgages underwater. Declining house prices have also affected prime borrowers.\nWhile default rates on prime mortgages are lower than for adjustable-rate subprime loans,\ndelinquency rates among all categories are highly correlated with house price declines\nacross regions of the country.\nRising delinquencies on subprime mortgages triggered huge disruptions in the\nmarkets for asset-backed securities (ABS) and these problems are central to the\nemergence of the credit crunch. Because most subprime mortgages were packaged into\nmortgage backed securities (MBS), and into the more complex collections called\ncollateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, surging credit losses, and prospects for further\nlosses, meant lower values for all of the securities that were based on them. Losses\nrelated to the subprime market even inflicted collateral damage on a completely unrelated\nmarket—the market for municipal bonds. Some companies that insure these bonds had\nexposure to the subprime market as well, precipitating downgrades in their credit ratings\nor the potential for such downgrades in the future.\nThe problems afflicting mortgage-related ABS spread to some other classes of\nABS as well. Many types of underlying loans, including credit card, commercial real\nestate, auto, business and student loans, had been packaged into such securities. The\ncontagion to these sectors occurred for a variety of reasons, including a general flight to\nsafety by now-risk-averse investors; the recognition that similar, although less\n6\n\npronounced, declines in underwriting standards may have occurred in some other credit\nareas such as commercial real estate and leveraged lending; widespread concern about the\nvalidity of the evaluations of securities that had been issued by the rating agencies; and a\ndrying up of short-term funding for a set of vehicles and institutions that were significant\ninvestors in these securities.\nLosses from holding asset-backed securities have been suffered by a broad range\nof investors. As it turns out though, a large share of the exposure resided with\ncommercial banks, with nonbank subsidiaries of financial holding companies, and with\nthe highly leveraged entities in the “ shadow banking sector.” Write-downs on ABS\nreduced the equity cushions in all of these firms and increased their leverage at a time\nwhen the growing risks in the financial markets made them desire less leverage, not\nmore. Some commercial banks suffered additionally because they had an unanticipated\nbuildup of mortgages and loans related to leveraged buyouts on their balance sheets.\nBecause they were active securitizers themselves, these loans were in the pipeline for\nsecuritization but could not be sold. In addition, when SIVs they had sponsored were in\ndanger of failing, some banks decided to rescue them by taking the underlying assets\nback onto their own balance sheets. All of these factors raised banks’ own leverage\nlevels and diminished their capital cushions. Many banks are raising additional capital,\nbut most are also tightening credit terms and restricting availability of loans to many\nhouseholds and businesses. For example, the Federal Reserve’s Senior Loan Officers\nSurvey documents a broad-based tightening in terms and reduction in the availability of\ncredit since last summer.\n7\n\nAt the same time that availability of bank funding has tightened, new issuance of\nasset-backed securities has all but disappeared as a viable funding option for several\ntypes of borrowing. In particular, the markets for securities backed by private-label\nmortgages, commercial mortgages, and leveraged loans have all become quite illiquid as\na consequence of the turmoil. As leveraged institutions sought to strengthen their balance\nsheets and, in some cases, meet margin calls, by selling ABS, asset prices declined,\nexacerbating losses and escalating the market pressures in a vicious cycle, making it\nalmost impossible, in some cases, to determine appropriate prices for the securities.\nIlliquidity and higher risk premia have also afflicted the money markets that serve\nas sources of short-term funding for banks, a further factor reducing their willingness to\nlend. Banks are accustomed to borrowing in the term interbank markets from one\nanother to manage liquidity. However, many banks that normally borrow and lend to\neach other, have become reluctant to lend. This presumably reflects recognition of the\nneed to preserve their own liquidity to meet unexpected credit demands and greater\nuncertainty about the creditworthiness of counterparties.\nEven as we move beyond those portions of the credit markets dominated by bank\nlending and loan securitization, we still see evidence of tighter credit conditions. For\nexample, in the corporate bond market, which is still functioning fairly well, spreads\nfacing all borrowers have risen. Riskier borrowers, issuing low-grade corporate bonds,\nface higher rates even though a worldwide “flight to safety,” coupled with an easing of\nmonetary policy by the Fed, has contributed to a sharp decline in interest rates on\nTreasury securities since last June. The increase in spreads presumably reflects both\n8\n\nhigher risk aversion among investors and heightened perceptions of the possible\ndownside risks to firms that would result from a weaker economy.\nAt the end of March, the credit market stresses I have described actually escalated\nto the point where they posed the risk of a systemic meltdown. In particular, the Bear\nStearns episode showed how concerns about credit quality and solvency for an\nintermediary can devolve into liquidity problems. The fear that Bear would be unable to\nmeet its obligations to its creditors triggered a sudden withdrawal of credit—as in an old-\nfashioned bank run. Of course, the perceived inability of one institution to meet its\nobligations is likely to cast doubt on the ability of others to meet theirs, triggering chains\nof distress and systemic risk.\nThe Federal Reserve was created precisely to stem such systemic risks by acting\nas a lender of last resort, although not since the Great Depression has it acted to\naccomplish it by lending directly through its discount window to an entity other than a\ndepository institution. Had the Fed not intervened, however, Bear Stearns would have\nbeen unable to meet the demands of the counterparties in its repurchase agreements and\nthus intended to file for bankruptcy. Doing so might well have led to widespread fears in\nthe financial markets, with declining prices for asset-backed securities triggering margin\ncalls, forced selling pushing prices down further, and mark-to-market losses triggering\nreductions in capital and escalating problems in other highly leveraged institutions. The\nFed’s recent decision to set up a facility to provide credit to other primary dealers reflects\nthe potential of this important group of institutions to create systemic risk with\nunacceptable consequences for the economy as a whole.\n9\n\nIn addition to the actions with respect to Bear Stearns and the Primary Dealer\nCredit Facility, the Fed has responded in a number of ways to improve and protect market\nliquidity. We’ve lowered the spread of the discount rate above the federal funds rate\nfrom 100 to 25 basis points; created a new auction facility to make term loans to banks\nbased on a broader range of collateral (the Term Auction Facility); set up another facility\nto lend Treasury securities in exchange for certain asset-backed securities (the Term\nSecurities Lending Facility); engaged in term repurchase agreements with primary\ndealers; and approved swaps with the ECB and Swiss National Bank to enable them to\nincrease dollar liquidity to institutions in their markets.\nThese liquidity-enhancing actions are different from standard monetary policy\nbecause they do not involve changes in the federal funds rate—the Fed’s monetary policy\ntarget—and, unlike open market operations, they do not entail any change in the size of\nthe Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. Instead, they involve a change in the composition of\nthe Fed’s roughly $800 billion balance sheet away from outright ownership of U.S.\nTreasury securities and toward, for example, both short-term and term loans backed by a\nwider range of collateral to both depository institutions and primary dealers.\nI believe that the Fed’s liquidity operations, combined with its 325-basis-point cut\nin the Federal funds rate—a substantial easing of monetary policy—are having a\nbeneficial effect on financial markets. Although overall financial conditions are still far\nfrom normal, there are some rays of hope that the strains may be easing a bit. Over the\npast month or so, for example, spreads in the markets for conventional GSE-sponsored\nsecuritized mortgages and in corporate borrowing markets have declined. Moreover,\ncredit default swap spreads on many exposed financial institutions, a measure of their\n10\n\nperceived chance of default, are down substantially. Treasury rates have moved up,\nsuggesting reduced aversion to risk. And the major stock indexes have regained some\nground.\nHousing\nNow let me turn to the second of the three main factors behind the current\neconomic weakness—namely, the housing cycle. I have mentioned that earlier in this\ndecade when financial markets were “awash in liquidity,” bubble-like conditions\nemerged in many areas of the economy, including housing. During this period, housing\nconstruction was very strong and housing prices soared. In fact, the ratio of house prices\nto rents—a kind of price-dividend ratio for housing—reached historical highs by early\n2006, suggesting that house prices might be well above those that could be justified by\nfundamentals.\nSince then, housing markets have “hit the skids.” In inflation-adjusted terms,\nresidential construction fell by 13 percent in 2006 and by 14 percent in the first half of\nlast year. Of course, once the financial shock hit last summer, things got even worse,\nwith real residential construction dropping at a 24 percent rate on average since then.\nAnd, indicators of conditions in housing markets are pointing lower for the future.\nHousing starts and permits as well as sales are trending down, and inventories of unsold\nhomes remain at very high levels. These inventories will need to be worked off before\nconstruction can begin to rebound.\nI’ve already discussed the precipitous fall in house prices nationally, so it’s\nstriking to note that, even with these declines, the ratio of house prices to rents remains\n11\n\nquite high by historical standards. That, of course, suggests that further price declines\nmay be needed to bring housing markets into balance. This perspective is reinforced by\nfutures markets for house prices, which expect further declines in a number of\nmetropolitan areas this year. In particular, the Case-Shiller composite index for home\nprices shows a 15 to 20 percent year-over-year decline in the second half of this year.\nThe bottom line is that construction spending and house prices seem likely to\ncontinue to decline well into 2009.\nCommodity Prices\nThe behavior of commodity prices is the final of the three factors that lie behind\nour economic troubles. Prices for many commodities, not only crude oil, but also many\nmetals and foods, have risen sharply in recent years. On the demand side, pressure is\ncoming from several quarters. World real GDP growth has been exceptionally robust in\nrecent years, and the strength of demand has been particularly notable in the large\nemerging economies of China and India. In addition, biofuel production has added to\ndemand for some food commodities, like corn, and this has shifted demands to other\nfoods, raising their prices as well. Finally, some commentators have argued that\ncommodity prices have been pushed up by investors shifting demands to commodities in\nthe face of the current financial turmoil as debt and equity investments appear much\nriskier. However, if this factor were playing a significant role, I would expect to see big\nincreases in inventories of commodities as investors were expecting to make profits on\nrising prices. So far, I have not seen the evidence that this is occurring.\n12\n\nNormally, commodity price increases are transitory, in part because they elicit a\nstrong increase in supply that reverses the upward pressure on prices. But today,\nespecially for oil, supplies are increasingly coming from unconventional and more\nexpensive sources, so the supply responses tend to be smaller and to have longer lags. In\nthe case of food, government policies in the U.S. that have stimulated the production of\nbiofuels promise to maintain tight market conditions. Indeed, futures markets and some\nforecasts—for example, the IMF World Economic Outlook—expect many commodity\nprices to remain at around their current high levels rather than reverse course.\nOutlook for the economy\nThis grim trio—the credit crunch, the deflating housing bubble, and the rising\nprice of commodities—has combined to weigh heavily on demand by both consumers\nand businesses. Let me start with consumer spending, which is the largest sector of the\neconomy. National surveys show that consumer sentiment has plummeted, a stark\nindication of the many hurdles households face. Consumer spending slowed in the first\nquarter to only 1 percent growth from 2½ percent last year. Falling house prices have\nreduced household spending by lowering total wealth and the value of mortgage equity.\nIn addition, consumers face constraints due to declines in the stock market and tighter\nlending terms at depository institutions. The rise in delinquency rates across the\nspectrum of consumer loans is strongly indicative of the growing strains on households.\nAnd, the rise in the prices of energy, food, and other commodity prices have “taxed” the\ndisposable incomes of households and weighed on consumer spending. Yet another\nnegative factor is that labor markets have weakened. In recent months, growth in\n13\n\nnonfarm payroll employment slowed sharply, actually falling by 260,000 jobs over the\npast four months. Job loss will have a negative impact on the disposable income\navailable to households and therefore will provide an additional restraint on consumer\nspending.\nAs for business investment in equipment and software, this category registered a\ndecline in the first quarter following years of strong growth, and it would not be\nsurprising to see this weakness continue into next year. Nonresidential investment also\ndropped in the first quarter and is likely to face more problems as the year progresses\nsince the securitized finance markets used to finance these expenditures have all but dried\nup.\nFortunately, there are some countervailing factors helping to mitigate the\nsubstantial drags on the U.S. economy. U.S. exports have been strong, as foreign real\nGDP has advanced robustly over the past few years and as the falling dollar has made\nU.S. goods more competitive in global markets. I expect our net exports to continue to\nmake a positive contribution to U.S. growth. However, this result is by no means\nassured, as some countries—especially in Europe—are suffering from the turmoil in\nfinancial markets, and the sluggishness in the U.S. economy is likely to have a\ndampening effect on many economies abroad.\nEconomic policies in this country are also likely to provide a boost to growth. As\nI have mentioned, the FOMC has eased the stance of monetary policy substantially in the\npast six months, and I would expect these actions to contribute most strongly to growth in\nthe second half of this year. Moreover, the fiscal stimulus package signed into law\nrecently is well timed, and I am hopeful that this action will have a substantial\n14\n\nstimulatory effect. The rebates to households in 2008 will total more than $100 billion,\nand more than half of that amount will be distributed in May. Of course, the effects of\nthe program on GDP will depend on the fraction of the money that is spent. In this\nregard, there is reason for optimism. First, the fact that we are in the midst of a credit\ncrunch means that a higher portion of the population is credit constrained than usual, and\nthis means that more of the rebates are likely to be spent. Second, the design of the\nprogram puts emphasis on channeling more of the money to lower-income households\nwho are more likely to be credit constrained in any event. The main effects of the\nprogram are likely to hit in the current and next quarters, and they could be substantial.\nThis brings me to my bottom line for the outlook. Starting in the fourth quarter,\nthe economy slowed to a crawl. With stimulus from monetary and fiscal policy,\neconomic performance may improve later this year. Nonetheless, the economy is still\nlikely to turn in a very sluggish performance for the year as a whole. With the\nunemployment rate currently at 5 percent, it is a little above my estimate of its sustainable\nlevel, and the weak performance I expect this year is likely to push unemployment up\nfurther.\nForecasting is always an uncertain business. But I want to emphasize that we are\nfacing an unusually high degree of uncertainty at the present time. One only has to look\nat the latest Blue Chip forecasts to see that point. The range between the highest and\nlowest forecasts for real GDP growth is among the largest on record. The ten most\noptimistic forecasters are predicting over 2½ percentage points faster growth over the\nnext four quarters than the ten most pessimistic ones.\nOutlook for inflation\n15\n\nNow let me turn to inflation. Much of the recent data have been disappointing.\nOver the past twelve months, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index\nrose 3.2 percent, up from 2.5 percent over the prior year. An important reason for these\ndisappointing numbers, of course, is the rise in commodity prices that I have discussed.\nSome of this increase has probably also passed through to core PCE price inflation,\nwhich excludes food and energy. This measure has averaged 2.1 percent over the past\ntwelve months, and it is slightly above the range that I consider consistent with price\nstability.\nUnder present circumstances, judging future changes in commodity prices is\nobviously an important part of any inflation forecast. As I noted, future markets\ngenerally are expecting these prices to flatten out and remain at around today’s very high\nlevels. If this happens, then the effects of commodity prices on inflation will dissipate.\nIn order to continue to put upward pressure on inflation—which, after all, is the rate of\nchange of prices—commodity prices would have to do more than remain at today’s high\nlevels. They would need to keep on rising.\nWhile this seems unlikely based on experience in recent decades, we can’t rule\nout this possibility. Futures markets have been expecting a leveling out of most\ncommodity prices for several years now, and they keep being surprised by ongoing\nincreases. As I mentioned before, in part, this could reflect growing supply limitations on\nsome commodities, especially oil. However, there also is the possibility that commodity\nprices could fall in the future as the economic weakness in the U.S. and slowing in\nEurope could spread to the rest of the world, reining in demand for commodities. I\nmentioned before that there is an unusually wide spread in Blue Chip forecasts for real GDP\n16\n\ngrowth—well, not surprisingly, the dispersion for inflation forecasts is also unusually\nlarge at the present time, perhaps reflecting these divergent possibilities.\nEven if the direct influences of commodity prices on inflation eventually\ndissipate, they could still cause trouble. Some argue that before this happens, higher\ninflation could become built into inflation expectations and become self-perpetuating. In\nother words, some fear that the specter of stagflation may rear its ugly head as it did in\nthe 1970s and early 1980s. Stagflation is thought to arise from a cycle of wage and price\nincreases—a wage-price spiral—initiated by a shock such as rising commodity prices—\nand perpetuated by poor monetary policy credibility and unanchored inflation\nexpectations. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the wage-price spiral was spun from the\npass-through of rising food and energy prices to inflation, which was in turn passed along\nto wages and, then again, through to final goods prices. Fueling the movement were\nexpectations that monetary policy would allow inflation to continue to rise for the\nforeseeable future.\nI see little reason to believe that we have entered, or are about to enter, such a\nperiod of stagflation. For one thing, although current data on growth and inflation have\ndeparted from desirable levels, matters looked far worse 30 years ago than they do now.\nFor another, there is no evidence that wages have started to spiral up, as broad\nmeasures of compensation have expanded quite moderately over the past year.\nMoreover, productivity growth has been fairly robust, and, after incorporating its effects,\nunit labor costs were up by only ¼ of 1 percent over the past year. In addition, the slack\nin labor and product markets stemming from the weakening in economic activity that\nseems likely should put somewhat greater downward pressure on inflation going forward.\n17\n\nTherefore, my forecast of the most likely outcome over the next couple of years is that\ntotal and core inflation will moderate from present levels.\nThe Federal Reserve cannot, however, be complacent about inflation. Some\nsurvey measures of long-run inflation expectations have inched up, and measures of\ninflation compensation derived from the differential between nominal and real Treasury\nyields are slightly higher, too. While none of these measures are perfect indicators of\ninflation expectations, recent movements highlight the risk that our attempts to deal with\nproblems in the real economy could lead to higher inflation expectations and an erosion\nof our credibility.\nPolicy\nLet me now turn to monetary policy. As I’ve just indicated, core inflation\nremains on the high side of where I would like it to be. At the same time, activity is weak\nacross most sectors of the economy, as the housing downturn, the escalation of\ncommodity prices, and the ongoing financial shock are weighing heavily on consumption\nspending, business capital investment, and employment.\nThe FOMC has responded to these conditions by easing monetary policy\nsubstantially since September, cutting the federal funds rate by 3¼ percentage points to 2\npercent. With core consumer inflation running at about the same rate, the real funds rate\nnow stands at an accommodative level of around zero. These cuts in the target rate, along\nwith the actions to foster greater liquidity in financial markets, have mitigated the worst\neffects of the credit crunch. But they have not resolved it. Indeed, my sense is that the\nprocess of resolution will unfold only gradually.\n18\n\nUnder these circumstances, I consider the current level of monetary\naccommodation to be appropriate. That, together with the fiscal package, should be\nsufficient to promote a gradual step up to moderate economic growth later this year.\nLikewise, I would expect that inflation will moderate in coming quarters, as more slack in\nlabor and product markets emerges and as commodity prices level off. Of course, we\nwill continue to monitor developments and act as needed to fulfill our mandate for\nsustainable economic growth and price stability.\nReferences\nAdrian, Tobias, and Hyun Song Shin. 2008. “Liquidity, Monetary Policy, and Financial Cycles.” Current\nIssues in Economics and Finance 14(1) (January/February), Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\nhttp://www.ny.frb.org/research/current_issues/ci14-1.html\nDemyanyk, Yuliya, and Otto van Hemert. 2008. “Understanding the Subprime Mortgage Crisis.”\nManuscript, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (February 4).\nhttp://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1020396\nDoms, Mark, Frederick Furlong, and John Krainer. 2007a. “Subprime Mortgage Delinquency Rates.”\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Working Paper 2007-33.\nhttp://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/papers/2007/wp07-33bk.pdf\nDoms, Mark, Frederick Furlong, and John Krainer. 2007b. “House Prices and Subprime Mortgage\nDelinquencies.” FRBSF Economic Letter 2007-14 (June 8).\nhttp://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2007/el2007-14.html\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. 2008 (forthcoming). 2007 Annual Report.\nGerardi, Kristopher, Adam Hale Shapiro, and Paul S.

    "text": "Luncheon Keynote Speech to the Annual Washington Policy Conference Sponsored by the\nNational Association for Business Economics (NABE)\nWashington D.C.\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on Monday, March 13, 2006, 12:45 PM Eastern Time, 9:45 AM Pacific\nEnhancing Fed Credibility\nGood afternoon. It’s always a pleasure to speak to the members of NABE, and I very\nmuch appreciate the invitation to participate in this year’s Economic Policy Conference.\nMy remarks today will focus on the issue of credibility—in particular on the Federal\nReserve’s credibility regarding its announced commitment to maintaining price stability. I will\ndiscuss ways in which the Federal Reserve could improve transparency and communication,\nenhancing Fed credibility and the effectiveness of monetary policy.\nTo my mind, credibility is a worthy end in itself—those who are credible are often said to\nbe “as good as their word.” But credibility is not only virtuous; it is also useful. I will argue that\none of its most important benefits is shaping public expectations about inflation, and in\nparticular, “anchoring” those expectations to price stability. As a consequence, credibility\nenhances the effectiveness of monetary policy which, in turn, serves a second “worthy end”,\nnamely, maximizing the nation’s economic well-being.\nTo give you a brief overview of the argument, the idea is that, with credibility, the Fed\nand the public work together toward the same goals. When this happens, one often hears the\nphrase “the markets do all the work of monetary policy,” meaning that market participants\ncorrectly anticipate the actions that the Fed will make in response to economic news and shocks.\nThis alignment of the Fed’s actions and the public’s expectations strengthens the monetary\npolicy transmission mechanism and shortens policy lags. In contrast, in the absence of\n1\n\ncredibility, policymakers and the public may work at cross-purposes, and monetary policy must\nact to overcome and dislodge expectations that hinder the achievement of our goals. Indeed, as I\nwill discuss more fully in a few minutes, this is exactly what happened in the 1970s in the United\nStates.\nCredibility is all about what the public expects the Fed will do in the future. Indeed,\nmacroeconomic theory teaches us that expectations of future economic developments play a\nprominent role in all aspects of economic decision-making. For example, consumption theory\ntells us that consumer spending depends on one’s permanent income, that is, the present value of\nexpected future income. Similarly, bond yields depend on expected future short-term interest\nrates. The list goes on and on. Of critical importance for the successful conduct of monetary\npolicy, economic theory tells us that prices set today depend on the inflation rate expected in the\nfuture. Therefore, it is only when the Fed’s commitment to low inflation is credible that people\nwill expect low inflation in the future and set prices accordingly. Clearly, then, expectations of\nfuture inflation play a central role in our analysis of the economy and in our policy deliberations.\nWe have certainly seen the grim consequences when the Fed’s commitment to low\ninflation is not credible. Let me step briefly back in time to remind you. In the 1950s and early\n1960s the Fed had accumulated an enviable track record of maintaining price stability—for\nexample, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price inflation rate averaged a little more\nthan 1-1/2 percent from 1955 to 1965.1 But, starting in the late 1960s, the grip on inflation had\nbegun to slip. By1970, the core measure of PCE price inflation roughly tripled to over 4-1/2\npercent; and then between 1970 and 1980, it doubled to over 9 percent. Not surprisingly, by\n1980, the public had little faith in the Fed’s commitment to price stability, and in that year,\nexpectations of inflation for the next 10 years reached 8 percent. The economy had entered a\n2\n\nwage-price-expectations spiral where higher inflation fed into higher wage demands and higher\nexpected inflation, which fed back into higher inflation. Worse yet, high inflation occurred at the\nsame time as high unemployment: stagflation had set in.\nTo be sure, the 1970s were a challenging period for monetary policy. Sizable negative\nsupply shocks, including the oil price shocks and the productivity slowdown, created difficult\nshort-run tradeoffs between the Fed’s dual goals—maximum sustainable employment and price\nstability. But monetary policy decisions at the time also greatly exacerbated these problems.\nResearch suggests that the dismal macroeconomic record of the 1970s could have been\nsignificantly improved if the Fed had “taken ownership” of the inflation situation—that is, if it\nhad paid close and consistent attention to keeping inflation contained. By doing so, it would\nhave done a better job of anchoring expectations to low inflation. For example, one study\nanalyzed the effects of supply shocks when the Fed has imperfect credibility and the public\ncontinuously reevaluates its perception of Fed policy based on what occurs in the economy.2 It\nshowed that a sustained rise in inflation combined with accommodative monetary policy, like the\none that occurred during the late 1960s and much of the 1970s, impels a process that undermines\nthe public’s confidence in the Fed’s commitment to low inflation. In other words, these\ndevelopments eventually erode the cable tethering expectations to price stability as people come\nto believe that the prevailing high inflation rate will persist into the indefinite future, just as\noccurred in the 1970s. If, instead, the Fed responds enough to stem the rise in inflation, inflation\nexpectations remain well anchored to price stability. This research suggests that if the Fed had\nfollowed such a policy during the 1970s, even in the face of those severe supply shocks, the\nresult would have been lower and much more stable inflation and unemployment, which, in turn,\nwould have obviated the need for the painful disinflationary recessions of the early 1980s.\n3\n\nThis research also suggests another very important benefit of central bank credibility—\nthat is, of monetary policy that successfully anchors expectations to price stability. Such a policy\ncan improve the achievement of both parts of the Fed’s dual mandate: maximum sustainable\nemployment and price stability. When the public is confident in the Fed’s commitment to price\nstability, the Fed has more latitude to respond to fluctuations in labor and product markets,\nbecause there is less risk that an easing of policy will unleash a wave of inflation fears.3\nFortunately, the Fed’s commitment to price stability has indeed become far more credible\nsince the 1970s, so I can illustrate this point based on some recent experience. In 2001, the Fed\nwas able to cut rates aggressively in response to the recession, confident that inflation\nexpectations would remain low. Similarly, over the past two years, wages, core inflation, and\nlong-run inflation expectations have remained well contained despite a dramatic increase in\nenergy prices. With inflation expectations under control, we have avoided a rehash of the 1970s\nand the need to rein in inflation by engineering a severe recession.\nHow has the Fed built this credibility? As I said at the outset, the Fed, like other central\nbanks, has earned its credibility: It has a long track record of delivering low and stable inflation.\nBut digging deeper into the process, I’d like to focus on two aspects of policy—one having to do\nwith policy actions and the other with the words that support those actions—that have changed\ndramatically since the 1970s and that have contributed to this admirable track record.\nFirst, in terms of policy actions, the Fed has become more systematic in its approach to\nmaintaining price stability and promoting maximum sustainable employment. This systematic\napproach is well-described by the famous “Taylor Rule” (John Taylor, 1993). According to the\nTaylor Rule, an increase in inflation should consistently call forth a tighter monetary policy in\nthe form of a higher real federal funds rate. In addition, the Fed should systematically tighten\n4\n\npolicy as labor market slack diminishes. Such a response serves to stabilize output and\nemployment and also to preempt an increase in inflation. The experience of 1994 exemplifies\nthe application of these principles: faced with declining unemployment and the prospect of an\nunwelcome increase in inflation, the Fed engineered a strong funds rate response. Because the\nFed has been consistent in its approach, over time, market participants have come to observe its\nreaction to news and therefore better understand the determinants of policy. Therefore, this\napproach has enhanced the ability of financial markets to anticipate the policy response to\neconomic developments.\nSecond, the Fed has taken a number of steps to improve the public’s understanding of its\npolicy decisions through an increased emphasis on communication and transparency. In early\n1994, just twelve years ago, the FOMC first started to announce explicitly changes in the federal\nfunds rate target in the post-meeting press release. Later that year, it added descriptions of the\nstate of the economy and the rationale for the policy action to the release. In 2000, the FOMC\nintroduced a statement describing the “balance of risks” to the outlook, and in 2002 the\nCommittee began releasing the votes of its individual members and the preferred policy choices\nof any dissenters. In 2003, the FOMC first gave forward-looking guidance on policy in the post-\nmeeting release, stating “that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable\nperiod.” Finally, last year, it decided to release the minutes of its meetings with a much shorter\ndelay—only three weeks, as opposed to just after the subsequent meeting. This shorter time\nhorizon provides the public with a more timely and nuanced understanding of the various views\nwithin the Committee.\nThis enhanced transparency complements the systematic approach because it, too, helps\nthe markets anticipate the Fed's response to economic developments. Recent research highlights\n5\n\nthe ways in which central bank communication can improve the public’s ability to predict policy\nactions, and how this improvement can enhance the effectiveness of policy at stabilizing the\neconomy.4 The key insight of this research is that the central bank has useful knowledge about\nthe likely direction of the economy and monetary policy that the public does not have.\nConveying this information to the public better aligns private and central bank expectations\nabout policy and the economy. And this appears to be working in practice: financial markets\nhave become much better at forecasting the future path of monetary policy than they were up to\nthe late 1980s, and are more certain of their forecast ex ante, as measured by implied volatilities\nfrom options contracts.5\nEnhanced transparency is particularly valuable when policy has to deviate from its\nnormal, systematic approach. A good illustration comes from 2003, when inflation fell below a\ncomfortable level and there was a threat of outright deflation. In post-FOMC meeting statements\nissued that year, the FOMC referred to “…an unwelcome fall in inflation…” and worried about\n“…the risk of inflation becoming undesirably low…” Consistent with the findings of economic\nresearch, it made sense for the FOMC to take a more accommodative stance than otherwise\nwould be expected until this threat had passed.6 For this policy strategy to work, it required that\nthe public understand it and correctly foresee that policy would remain accommodative for some\ntime. Again, it is the public’s expectation of future actions, not just the current setting of the fed\nfunds rate, that matters for bond rates, inflation expectations, and other economic variables.\nTherefore, the FOMC statement at that time said, \"In these circumstances, the Committee\nbelieves that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period.\" This forward-\nlooking language itself seems to have helped keep long-term interest rates low, which added\nstimulus to the economy and helped avoid deflation.\n6\n\nI believe these two features of Fed monetary policy—a systematic approach to policy and\nthe steps towards more open communication and transparency—are particularly noteworthy in\ncontributing to our policy success over the past two decades. They have helped strengthen public\nconfidence in the Fed and thereby helped anchor inflation expectations to price stability.\nAdditionally, by providing clear explanations of its policies to the public, greater transparency\nhas also enhanced Fed accountability, a vital consideration for a government institution in a\ndemocracy.\nBut, despite the many steps that we have made on communication and transparency,\nother central banks have gone further than the Fed. Indeed, a growing number of “inflation\ntargeting” central banks explicitly state a numerical objective for the inflation rate and provide\nreports detailing their economic forecasts.7 There has been a great deal of discussion of whether\nthe Federal Reserve should likewise take further steps towards more open communication,\nincluding publicly announcing a specific, numerical inflation objective. I will spend the\nremainder of my remarks addressing this question, looking first to the results from theoretical\nand empirical research on the effects of such communication.\nFirst, what are the benefits of adopting a numerical objective for inflation? In theory,\neffective central bank communication of a numerical long-run inflation objective to the public\ncan simplify the complicated informational problems people face in the economy, and can reduce\nthe uncertainty about the central bank’s goals and policies. Indeed, recent research suggests that\nclear communication of a numerical long-run inflation objective may assist in the anchoring of\nlong-run inflation expectations, relative to a policy that leaves it to the public to infer the\nobjective from experience.8 The resulting improved alignment of Fed actions and public\nperceptions would reduce expectations errors that would otherwise add to macroeconomic\n7\n\nvariability. As a result, the Fed would be better able to achieve both inflation and employment\ngoals. In the parlance of economists, communication of a numerical long-run inflation objective\ncould shift inward the “macroeconomic possibilities frontier”—the economy’s menu of feasible\noutput and inflation volatility combinations. Of course, for communication to be effective,\npolicymakers must consistently take appropriate actions that back up the commitment to price\nstability and full employment.\nAnother important reason to provide clear guidance to the public regarding the long-run\ninflation objective is that doing so may help us avoid deflation and reduce the costs of its\noccurrence. We have long known that inflation can be too high, but the recent experience of\nJapan has reminded us that inflation can be too low as well. We know from history that such an\noutcome can be extremely damaging to the economy. Perhaps the most unsettling aspect of the\nexperience of Japan over the past decade is how difficult it can be to extract oneself from\ndeflation. An explicit numerical long-run inflation objective may help anchor inflation\nexpectations at a low positive number and avoid a potentially devastating deflationary spiral.\nWhat is the empirical evidence on the value of an explicit numerical inflation objective?\nSo far, it has been hard to find convincing evidence that countries with an announced numerical\ninflation objective have performed better in terms of inflation and macroeconomic stabilization\nthan those that do not have one. Part of the problem is that there just aren’t enough\nmacroeconomic data to get a clear read on this question.9 But we do have data on inflation\nexpectations that provide evidence about the effect of communication on anchoring expectations,\nwhich is the key mechanism that improves macro performance in the theoretical research I’ve\ndiscussed.\nSurveys of long-run inflation expectations have been remarkably stable in both the\nUnited States and in inflation-targeting countries over the past ten years. Indeed, based on the\nevidence from survey data, it’s hard to argue that inflation expectations are not pretty well\n8\n\nanchored already.10 An extreme example is provided by the Survey of Professional Forecasters;\nits median forecast of inflation over the next ten years has barely budged from 2.5 percent over\nthe past 6 years, despite large fluctuations in energy prices and other disturbances.\nBut, the evidence on the stability of long-run inflation expectations in the United States\nderived from financial markets is not quite so reassuring. Researchers using measures of\ninflation expectations derived from bond market data find that long-run inflation expectations in\ninflation-targeting countries are remarkably stable and well-anchored, while in the United States\nlong-run inflation expectations have been highly sensitive to economic news.11 These studies\nexamine far-ahead forward inflation compensation—the difference between far-ahead forward\ninterest rates on nominal and inflation-indexed bonds—to measure long-term inflation\nexpectations. Although this measure of long-term inflation “compensation” is noisy and by no\nmeans perfect, the extent to which it moves in response to major economic news—such as\neconomic data releases and monetary policy announcements—nonetheless sheds light on the\nstability of long-term inflation expectations in a given country. Thus, if ten-year-ahead forward\ninflation compensation does not respond significantly or systematically to major economic news,\nthen that suggests that financial market participants have relatively well-anchored views about\nthe long-term outlook for inflation in that country.\nFor the United States, they find that far-ahead forward inflation compensation has\nexhibited significant, systematic responses to macroeconomic data releases and monetary policy\nannouncements. These responses suggest that developments that affect the near-term outlook for\nthe economy also pass through to expectations of inflation at much longer horizons. However, in\ncountries with explicit numerical inflation objectives, including Canada and Sweden, the\nresearch finds that long-term inflation compensation has been unresponsive to economic news.\nAlthough the evidence from surveys and financial markets is admittedly mixed, taken together\nthese studies suggest that announcing a numerical price stability objective and greater\ntransparency in general could help further anchor long-run inflation expectations.\n9\n\nMy personal view is that the steps that we have already taken toward greater transparency\nhave been a good thing, and that we should think seriously about venturing further along this\npath. As Mae West famously said, “Too much of a good thing can be wonderful.” More\nseriously, although it is possible to carry transparency too far—I would not, for example, want\nlive television coverage of FOMC meetings—I support the idea of a quantitative objective for\nprice stability. I believe that it enhances both Fed transparency and accountability and that it\noffers important benefits, as I have discussed. In particular, it could help to anchor the public's\nlong-term inflation expectations from being pushed too far up or down, and thus help avoid both\ndestabilizing inflation scares and deflations; a credible inflation objective could thereby enhance\nthe flexibility of monetary policy to respond to the real effects of adverse shocks.\nA numerical definition of price stability could also help to focus and clarify our own\nanalysis and discussions in the FOMC. For example, the Board staff regularly prepares detailed\nforecasts and analyses of monetary policy options. But, this otherwise quite sophisticated\nanalysis is hampered by the lack of clear guidance as to what exactly the long-run inflation\nobjective is.12 In particular, it is difficult to derive and analyze the appropriate path for policy\nwhen one does not know what the policy goal is. Similarly, I think the discussion of risks to\nprice stability at the policy table would gain a sharper focus if we had a numerical price stability\nobjective.\nIndeed, articulating an explicit numerical long-run inflation objective may not be such a\nbig step as some people imagine. Many people have interpreted the FOMC statements in 2003\nthat I mentioned before as signaling a lower bound for the amount of inflation the FOMC will\naccept and statements in other years placing an upper bound on acceptable inflation. In addition,\nseveral FOMC members have already publicly referred to their comfort zones for inflation and\n10\n\nthese have been repeated by the press and market analysts. Therefore, such a declaration may\nserve to solidify and clarify what people already believe to be true.\nIn my view, the choice of a specific inflation objective should depend, in part, on an\nevaluation of the costs and benefits of very low inflation. The inflation objective should contain\na buffer sufficient to make sure that the lower bound on the nominal interest rate does not\ninterfere with the ability of monetary policy to stabilize the economy and that downward nominal\nwage rigidity does not interfere with overall labor market performance. Factors such as the\nmagnitude of the neutral real funds rate, the degree of macroeconomic volatility, and the pace of\nproductivity growth, are relevant in assessing the size of the needed buffer. Estimates of the\nextent of measurement bias in the relevant inflation indices must also figure into the choice of\nthe numerical objective.13\nThe choices of a specific index, objective and range are matters on which judgments may\ndiffer. Taking the various factors that I mentioned into account, I see an inflation rate of 1-1/2\npercent as measured by the core personal consumption expenditures price index, with a comfort\nzone extending between 1 and 2 percent, as an appropriate price stability objective for the Fed.\nIn terms of setting a long-run goal, I think it makes sense to focus our public communication on\none specific price index. Doing so is simpler and more transparent than giving out multiple,\npotentially contradictory, objectives for different price indices. Of course, the issue of the\nappropriate level of the long-run inflation objective should be occasionally revisited. If the\nfundamental factors influencing this choice of a numerical inflation objective were to change\nsignificantly, the level of the objective should be revised accordingly.\nAs with any change in procedure, there are potential drawbacks. One is the possibility\nthat some observers may misinterpret the enunciation of a long-run inflation objective as a down-\nweighting of the Committee’s mandate to foster maximum employment. Moreover, there is an\n11\n\nactual risk that the Committee’s performance with respect to the employment goal could actually\nbe compromised if too short a time-frame is allowed for the attainment of the price-stability\nobjective. To reduce the risk of such an outcome, the announcement of any numerical inflation\nobjective should be made in the context of clear and effective communication of the Fed’s\nmultiple goals. Here, I am drawn to some specific language proposed by Chairman Bernanke\n(2003) while he was a Fed Governor: “the FOMC regards this inflation rate as a long-run\nobjective only and sets no fixed time frame for reaching it. In particular, in deciding how quickly\nto move toward the long-run inflation objective, the FOMC will always take into account the\nimplications for near-term economic and financial stability.” I concur that the numerical\nobjective is a long-run goal, and would want the Committee to have a flexible timeframe within\nwhich to maintain it.\nBut, you may ask: If the FOMC were to announce a numerical long-run price stability\nobjective, why shouldn’t the Fed also announce a target for full employment, the other half of the\ndual mandate? In fact, the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978 –often referred\nto as the Humphrey-Hawkins Act-- did that, stipulating a 4 percent unemployment rate target, as\nwell as a zero inflation target. However, unlike the inflation rate, which is under the long-run\ncontrol of the central bank, the Fed does not have the capacity to achieve any long-run\nunemployment objective that is not consistent with economic fundamentals.\nOf course, we do attempt to gauge the level of maximum sustainable employment in\nanalyzing the economy and evaluating policy choices. However, the two pieces of this puzzle,\nthe natural rate of unemployment and trend labor force participation, change over time in\nunpredictable ways and are measured with considerable error. In the spirit of clearer\ncommunication, I think it would be worthwhile to communicate more fully to the public our\nanalysis and views on the economic outlook and estimates of sustainable employment,\nunemployment, and output. But, raising these estimates to the level of a formal explicit\n12\n\nnumerical long-run unemployment objective would be misguided and confusing, and could\nendanger our hard-won credibility.\nIn addition to announcing a numerical price stability objective, I believe the Fed should\ncontinue to enhance its communications regarding the economic outlook and perspectives on\nmonetary policy. Other central banks have adopted a wide range of communications practices\naimed at improving both transparency and accountability. We should carefully study whether\nany of these might be suitable for the Federal Reserve to adopt. Although policymakers may not\nsee the future perfectly, we do know what we are thinking about in terms of policy, and we\nshould convey that information to the public as best we can.\nIn summary, the Fed has made significant progress in building credibility over the past\ntwo decades by following systematic and appropriate monetary policy and gradually increasing\nthe quality of our communication and transparency. I think it makes sense to take this\ntransparency at least one step further by articulating a numerical price stability objective. I\nrecognize that there are potential costs to doing so, but to my mind, they are outweighed by the\nbenefits. Such a step could further enhance the credibility of the Fed and improve the\neffectiveness of monetary policy not only for controlling inflation but also for stabilizing\nemployment and output.\n13\n\nReferences\nBall, Lawrence, and Niamh Sheridan. 2003. “Does Inflation Targeting Make a Difference?” In\nThe Inflation-Targeting Debate, eds.

Specifically, the 2013 Final Rule finalizes changes first proposed on\nDecember 31, 2012, addressing these specific issues:\n Disclosure of Institution Fees and Foreign Taxes - The 2013 Final Rule modifies the 2012 Final\nRule to make optional, in certain circumstances, the requirement to disclose fees imposed by a\ndesignated recipient’s institution. The 2013 Final Rule would also make optional the requirement\nto disclose taxes collected by a person other than the remittance transfer provider. In place of\nthese two former requirements, the 2013 Final Rule requires disclaimers to be added to the rule’s\ndisclosures indicating that the recipient may receive less than the disclosed total due to the fees\nand taxes for which disclosure is now optional.\n Errors from Incorrect Account Information - The 2013 Final Rule also creates an exception to the\n2012 Final Rule’s error provisions for certain situations in which a sender provides an incorrect\naccount number or recipient institution identifier and that mistake results in the transfer being\ndeposited in the account of someone other than the designated recipient. If certain conditions are\nmet, the remittance transfer provider would be required to attempt to recover the funds but would\nnot bear the cost of funds that cannot be recovered. The 2013 Final Rule also streamlines the\nerror resolution procedures in other situations where a sender’s provision of incorrect or\nincomplete information results in an error under the rule.\nAs noted in the CFPB’s press release, the complete money transfer rule, which includes the 2013 Final\nRule and the rules published on February 7, 2012 (77 FR 6194), July 10, 2012 (77 FR 40459), and\nAugust 20, 2012 (77 FR 50244) are effective October 28, 2013.\nResource\nAdditional information on CFPB rules and related guidance can be found on the CFPB’s website at\nhttp://www.consumerfinance.gov/.\nAdditional Information\nAll circulars and documents are available on the Internet through the Federal Reserve Bank of San\nFrancisco’s website, at http://www.frbsf.org/banking/letters.\nFor additional information regarding supervisory expectations, please contact:\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nBanking Supervision and Regulation\n(801) 322-7853\n1The final rule amends subpart B of Regulation E, which implements the Electronic Fund Transfer Act,\nand the official interpretation to the regulation.",

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nCeremonial Swearing-In\nAtrium\nFederal Reserve Board\nWashington D.C.\nMarch 5, 2014\n\n2\nGood afternoon. Thank you Dan, and thank you to everyone gathered here and others\nthroughout the System who are listening in.\nTo members of Congress, Secretary Lew and others from the administration and fellow financial\nregulatory agencies who are with us today, welcome to the Federal Reserve. Many friends and\nfamily of mine are here, including my spouse, George, my brother, John, and my sister-in-law,\nAlison. I am honored also to welcome back former Chairman Greenspan.\nI want to particularly thank President Obama for the honor of being asked to lead the Federal\nReserve and carry on its important work. When I accepted his offer, I promised the president I\nwould do my very best, working with my Fed colleagues, to help restore the health of the\neconomy and promote a strong and stable financial system.\nI am repeating this promise, in this distinguished company and to all others listening because that\nis what this ceremony is about. The oath I have affirmed, identical to the one taken by everyone\nserving the Federal Reserve, is a public promise to carry out my duties guided by no interest\nother than the public’s interest.\nToday’s event comes, as many of you know, a busy month after I began my duties as Chair. In\nthat short time, the Board has taken significant steps to further strengthen financial regulation,\nand I have discharged one of my most important responsibilities, accounting for the Fed’s\nactions and explaining its policies in our semi-annual report to Congress. I’ll do more of that\nexplaining in two weeks, when I respond to questions from the media after the next meeting of\nthe Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n3\nSuch communication is vital in a democracy and especially important for the Federal Reserve,\nwhich relies on the confidence of the public to be effective in carrying out its mission. Chairman\nBernanke initiated press conferences in 2011 as one of a number of steps to make the Federal\nReserve more transparent and accountable, and I promise to build on his legacy.\nSince 2010, when Chairman Bernanke stood where I stand today, we have made considerable\nprogress. The economy is stronger and the financial system is sounder. We have come a long\nway, but we have farther to go. More work lies ahead to complete implementation of Congress’\nplan for strengthening financial regulation, the Dodd-Frank Act. I promise to stay focused on\nmoving that process forward as quickly and responsibly as possible and to verify that these\nreforms are meeting the goal of safeguarding the financial system.\nI will also continue the work of helping repair the damage done by the financial crisis to the\neconomy. Too many Americans still can’t find a job or are forced to work part-time. The goals\nset by Congress for the Federal Reserve are clear: maximum employment and stable prices. It is\nequally clear that the economy continues to operate considerably short of these objectives. I\npromise to do all that I can, working with my fellow policymakers, to achieve the very important\ngoals Congress has assigned to the Federal Reserve.\nI take up these challenges aided by the immensely skilled, talented, and dedicated men and\nwomen who comprise the Federal Reserve's staff. Our staff constitute one of the Fed's greatest\nstrengths and I am proud to serve with individuals who exhibit the highest standards of\nprofessionalism and integrity. They work tirelessly, day in and day out, to serve the public\ninterest. Their skill, creativity and perseverance enabled the Fed to do its part to meet the grave\nthreats our nation faced in the financial crisis and then persevere in a disappointingly slow\n\n4\nrecovery. And their knowledge, analysis and judgment will be indispensable in fulfilling the\nmission of the Federal Reserve in the years ahead.\nCongress has entrusted the Federal Reserve with great responsibilities. The tools we deploy, to\nguide the financial system and influence our vast economy, can seem far removed from the lives\nand concerns of average Americans. And yet the decisions we make affect the welfare and shape\nthe future of every American. I promise to never forget the individual lives, experiences and\nchallenges that lie behind the statistics we use to gauge the health of the economy. The\nunemployment rate represents millions of individuals who are eager to work but struggling to\nprovide for themselves and their families. When we make progress toward our goals, each job\nthat is created lifts this burden for someone who is better equipped to be a good parent, to build a\nstronger community, and to contribute to a more prosperous nation.\nLet me close by offering my heartfelt thanks for the many messages I have received since my\nnomination from individuals around the country who have written to wish me well and offer\ntheir support. I pledge to do my very best to meet the challenges that lie ahead.\nThank you all for coming today.",

    "text": "2008 National Interagency Community Reinvestment Conference\nSan Francisco, California\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery March 31, 2008, 9:00 AM Pacific, 12:00 PM Eastern\nOpening Remarks to the 2008 National Interagency\nCommunity Reinvestment Conference\nGood morning. On behalf of the San Francisco Fed and our co-hosts, the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Office of Thrift\nSupervision, I’m delighted to welcome you to San Francisco and to the 2008 National\nInteragency Community Reinvestment Conference.\nThis year’s event marks the 13th time that the regulators have jointly sponsored a conference on\nthe Community Reinvestment Act. As in past years, one of the goals of this year’s conference is\nto help you to understand the regulations and provide you with information on how to meet your\nCRA obligations. But even more, the conference is designed to keep you informed of the most\nimportant developments in the field and to give you the opportunity to share emerging challenges\nand best practices with your colleagues. And there are always many emerging issues to\nhighlight. Indeed, since the first conference back in 1991, the field has evolved considerably—\nthe CRA itself has undergone significant revisions, New Markets Tax Credits have replaced Low\nIncome Housing Tax Credits as the complicated investment instrument of the day, and financial\nproducts and services are increasingly being targeted to meet the financial services needs of the\nunbanked.\nPerhaps the most notable change, however, is that in the last 25 years, consumer credit markets\nhave shifted dramatically, moving from a credit rationing approach to a risk-based pricing\nsystem. In other words, today, far fewer applicants are denied credit—rather, they are offered\ncredit at higher prices intended to reflect the greater risk posed by these loans.1 This shift,\ncoupled with other innovations in the financial markets, has significantly increased access to\ncredit, with both positive and negative effects.\n1\n\nOn the positive side, expanded access to credit has greatly increased the ability of low- and\nmoderate-income households of all races and ethnicities to become homeowners.2 None of us\nwould want to turn back the clock to the days when the prospects of being approved for a loan\nwere more limited in certain neighborhoods and for certain classes of borrowers. But, as has\nbecome apparent over the past year with the rise in mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures, the\nrisks associated with the changes in the consumer credit markets were greatly underestimated,\nand we are now grappling with the consequences.\nMy colleagues and I have been deeply involved in assessing the impact of rising foreclosures on\nthe financial markets and the U.S. economy, and in developing the Fed’s policy response. 3 On\nthe monetary policy front, we have undertaken several actions designed to stimulate demand in\nthe face of contractions in the housing market and the tightening of credit. We have also sought\nto bolster market liquidity and promote orderly market functioning through several new lending\nfacilities. We continue to carefully monitor trends in the financial markets and the economy, and\nwe are committed to acting in a timely manner to address new developments.\nIn my remarks today, however, I would like to focus on the implications of the trends in the\nconsumer credit markets—particularly in the area of subprime mortgage lending—for all of you\nhere working in the field of community development. Personally, one of my greatest concerns is\nhow the rise in foreclosures is affecting low-income families and communities. As I think many\nof you in this room have seen firsthand, the impact of foreclosures has been felt most acutely in\npeople’s homes and neighborhoods. Losing one’s home—from having to pack up boxes and face\nthe uncertainty of “what’s next” to the long-term financial consequences—is not the dream\nanyone imagines for themselves when they pick up the keys to their first house.\nFor these reasons, I believe it is incredibly important to develop and share innovative solutions\nthat can help to prevent foreclosures as well as mitigate the negative impact of foreclosures on\nborrowers and communities. In the words of the late Federal Reserve Board Governor Ned\nGramlich, who had the foresight to see the risks in the credit market well before many of us,\n“…one of the nation’s primary goals over the next few years should be the avoidance of a\n2\n\ndomino effect that forces large and unnecessary losses on households through unnecessary or\npremature foreclosures.”4 It is in pursuit of this goal that I offer my remarks today.\nForeclosure Trends and their Impact on Low-Income Communities\nTo begin the discussion, let me just quickly provide some context about the current scale of\ndelinquencies and foreclosures. While some communities have been struggling with high rates\nof foreclosure for a much longer time,5 the recent national rise in delinquencies and foreclosures\nhas been sudden and substantial. By one estimate, in 2007, more than 1.25 million homes\nentered foreclosure, and more than twice as many (2.6 million) were at least 30 days past due on\ntheir mortgage payments as of the fourth quarter of last year. 6\nMost of the problems have been concentrated in the subprime market, and in particular, among\nsubprime adjustable-rate mortgages, although more recently we’ve begun to see increases in\nforeclosures on subprime fixed-rate mortgages and even on prime adjustable rate mortgages.7\nThe reasons for the current crisis are complex and intertwined. Perhaps the most significant\nfactor driving the current rise in delinquency and foreclosures is declining house values.\nEconomic research has shown that downward changes in house prices are strongly associated\nwith subprime delinquency “hotspots.”8 Of particular concern, however, is how relaxed\nunderwriting standards and abusive lending practices have increased the risk of delinquency and\nforeclosure. As Chairman Bernanke recently noted, “far too much of the lending in recent years\nwas neither responsible nor prudent.”9 Between 2001 and 2006—right when we saw the largest\ngrowth in subprime lending—the quality of loans deteriorated fairly steadily as underwriting\ncriteria eased.10 Many subprime loans included additional risk factors, such as a lack of full\ndocumentation, high combined loan-to-values, and high debt-to-income ratios.\nWhile much attention has focused on interest rate resets as a trigger for delinquencies and\ndefaults—particularly on loans with artificially low introductory rates—so far they have not\nplayed a significant role.11 This is not to say, however, that resets won’t matter. In 2008, about\n1.5 million loans are scheduled to reset. The Federal Reserve Board estimates that for the\n3\n\naverage subprime borrower, this could lead to a 10 percent increase in their monthly mortgage\npayments.12 Especially for borrowers already stretched to the limit, these resets may\nsignificantly increase the likelihood of delinquency.\nThe mortgage crisis has serious implications for the people and communities that all of us serve.\nFor instance, data collected under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act show that minorities are\nmore likely to receive higher-priced loans than non-Hispanic whites, and that an increase in the\nincidence of higher-priced lending is associated with an increase in serious mortgage\ndelinquency rates.13 In addition, studies of cities like Baltimore, Chicago, and Cleveland have\nfound that low-income and minority communities have been the hardest hit by concentrations of\nforeclosures.14 The rise in foreclosures may have other negative implications as well, such as\nreducing neighborhood property values and increasing crime.15 Furthermore, as declining\nproperty taxes and transfer fees shrink local government revenues, vital services to low- and\nmoderate-income families may also suffer. What this means is that the foreclosure crisis is likely\nto have a profound impact on the communities you work in, with effects that go well beyond the\nhousing sector.\nBefore I turn to potential interventions, I want to make one final point. There has been a\ntendency to conflate the current problems in the subprime market with CRA-motivated lending,\nor with lending to low-income families in general. I believe it is very important to make a\ndistinction between the two. Most of the loans made by depository institutions examined under\nthe CRA have not been higher-priced loans,16 and studies have shown that the CRA has\nincreased the volume of responsible lending to low- and moderate-income households.17 We\nshould not view the current foreclosure trends as justification to abandon the goal of expanding\naccess to credit among low-income households, since access to credit, and the subsequent ability\nto buy a home, remains one of the most important mechanisms we have to help low-income\nfamilies build wealth over the long term.18\nBuilding a Foundation for Sustainable Homeownership\nWith that in mind, the current foreclosure crisis suggests to me the need to craft responses that\nwill mitigate the negative impacts of foreclosure, and compels us to revisit the question of how\n4\n\nto ensure that the tools that enable homeownership create sustainable benefits, both for families\nand for the communities in which they live.\nAs a first step, it is clear that avoiding preventable foreclosures should be a key priority for both\nthe private and public sectors. Many important initiatives are already underway, including\nefforts to improve borrower outreach through public service announcements and community\nevents, to develop a systematic and streamlined approach to restructuring adjustable rate loans,\nand to create new refinance options to help borrowers shift into more sustainable loan products.\nI support these efforts, as well as the collection of data that can help us to ascertain their\neffectiveness. I am particularly encouraged that efforts such as the HOPE NOW Alliance and\nthe Mortgage Relief Fund supported by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston are the result of\ncollaborative agreements among government agencies, regulators, lenders, investors, servicers\nand nonprofits. The complexity and seriousness of the foreclosure issue, and its deep impact on\nborrowers, neighborhoods, and the economy, call for these kinds of cross-sector partnerships,\nboth locally and nationally.\nThere are some signs that these efforts are working, and that the number of loan modifications is\ngrowing.19 In addition, the FHASecure plan and the increase in the FHA conforming loan limits\nshould enable more borrowers to refinance into an FHA-insured mortgage.20 The recent\nannouncement by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on plans to increase liquidity in the mortgage\nmarkets is also promising.21 Still, the scale and impact of these efforts to date are small\ncompared to the volume of loans that are delinquent, and many counselors and servicers lack the\ncapacity to respond effectively to demand. In addition, as home prices decline, many borrowers\nare finding themselves with loan amounts that are higher than their home values, limiting their\nrefinance options. It is critical that we continue to explore the possibility of a broader range of\ninterventions that would help keep families in their homes.\nBut, I think it is equally important to begin thinking now about how to ensure that access to\ncredit and homeownership provides a long-term benefit for low-income households and\ncommunities.\n5\n\nAs a first step, there is a need to develop new strategies that help low-income borrowers—\nparticularly those that may not have extensive financial knowledge—make better and more\ninformed credit choices. Additional investments in financial education and homeownership\ncounseling must be a key component of this strategy. Financial education has been shown to help\nhouseholds manage their finances more prudently, especially in decisions concerning credit,\nsaving, and investment, and it has been shown to reduce the likelihood of default.22 Calling for\nmore financial education is not a new idea, but challenges remain in funding educational\nprograms and developing appropriate curricula and delivery channels for diverse audiences.\nLater this morning, you will have a chance to see one new fun approach to teaching children\nabout financial management skills.\nSecond, we need to expand access to affordable homeownership opportunities. The gap in\nhomeownership affordability—especially in states like California—is as high as it has ever\nbeen.23 As long as an adjustable rate, interest-only or high LTV subprime loan is the only way\nto afford a house, low-income families will continue to take on loans that they cannot sustain\nover the long term, and may be at greater risk of falling prey to unscrupulous lending practices.\nIn stark contrast to the results we are seeing in the subprime market, the vast majority of new\nhomeowners who have gone through affordable homeownership programs—which often involve\npre- and post-purchase counseling and support as well as a savings component such as an\nIndividual Development Account—have not defaulted on their loans.\nThis evidence also speaks to a much greater need for savings options for low-income families,\nboth owners and renters.24 Helping families save for a downpayment, and ensuring that they\nhave a savings buffer to help them weather adverse economic times or life events, may lead to\nbetter outcomes overall than mortgages that make homeownership affordable only through risky\nloan terms.25\nIn addition, strategies to increase the supply of affordable homes are also needed. For example, I\nknow many of you in this room have been extremely proactive in thinking about innovative ways\nto convert foreclosed properties into affordable rental or homeownership opportunities.26 These\n6\n\nefforts, as well as other potential strategies, such as the establishment of housing trust funds and\ncommunity land trusts, can serve as mechanisms for creating long-term housing affordability.\nThird, to be successful, policies that help low-income and minority households enter\nhomeownership must be linked with broader community development strategies. Low-income\nhouseholds, and particularly low-income minority households, may be especially vulnerable to\nbuying homes in disadvantaged neighborhoods, where job opportunities are limited, schools are\noften subpar, and the financial benefits of homeownership may be more limited. 27 Much of the\nwork that you already do to stimulate neighborhood economic development, increase local\nemployment opportunities and wages, and improve neighborhood-linked amenities such as\nschools and transportation options, are critical in transforming the opportunities available to low-\nincome households.\nLast, but certainly not least, we need to think more broadly about how homeownership fits into\nthe overall asset-building picture for low-income households, and what other programs or\npolicies are necessary to ensure that homeownership is sustainable. In one study of low-income\nhomeowners, researchers found that two-thirds of households that refinanced their homes did so\nto pay down other debt, including higher cost credit card debt. Others borrowed against the\nequity in their homes to pay for medical and educational expenses.28 It is troubling that so many\nlow-income families have had to use home equity to help manage their overall debt load, or to\nbridge a gap in health care insurance. We need to help households learn how to manage their\nfinances and to create safety nets that offer protection against economic shocks, so that low-\nincome families are less vulnerable to losing their homes.\nConclusion\nTo conclude, I would like to note some of the ways the Federal Reserve is responding to this\ncrisis, even beyond the steps designed to stabilize the financial markets. These efforts are taking\nplace across the System, and are built on our strengths in research and data analysis and on our\nregional presence.\n7\n\nAt the San Francisco Fed, this work has included providing research, data and maps to\ncommunity groups and local governments on neighborhood hotspots as well as establishing local\ntask forces that can leverage local resources and stakeholders to respond to local needs. Through\nour convenings, we are working to improve communication between borrowers, counselors, and\nservicers to put a human face on what is often a distant, lengthy, and bureaucratic process. And,\nas always, we are committed to sharing best practices in foreclosure mitigation, both through our\npublications and through our convenings. Three of the panels at this year’s conference address\nthis topic, and will present strategies for preventing foreclosure and for mitigating the negative\nimpact on neighborhoods. In addition, the San Francisco Fed will be sponsoring a national\nconference specifically on how to address REO property issues in high-cost markets later this\nyear.\nFinally, while the issues of foreclosure are certainly capturing center stage, it is important not to\nforget all of the other aspects of the work you do in low- and moderate-income communities.\nOver the next two and a half days, whether you’re immersed in the CRA regulations, learning the\nbasics of underwriting multi-family rental properties, or exploring emerging topics in community\ndevelopment, I’m confident that you will return to your own communities with new ideas and\ncontacts. I applaud the dedication of each and every one of you to improving the lives of low-\nincome families, and I know that working together, you will continue to help lay the foundation\nfor sustainable and vibrant communities.\nThank you. I hope you enjoy the conference.\n# # #\n1 Eric S. Belsky and Ren S.

Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n2014 National Interagency Community Reinvestment Conference\nChicago, Illinois\nMarch 31, 2014\n\nI am here today to talk about what the Federal Reserve is doing to help our nation\nrecover from the financial crisis and the Great Recession, the effects of which were\nparticularly severe for the people and the communities you serve.\nPart of that effort has involved strengthening the financial system. New rules are\nin place to better protect consumers and ensure that credit is available to help\ncommunities grow. The Federal Reserve also plays a role in communities by fostering\ndialogue that promotes community development. I will highlight some initiatives around\nthe Federal Reserve System that I believe are making a real difference. Later today, I\nwill visit the Manufacturing Technology Program at Daley College, on Chicago’s south\nside, where adult students are acquiring the skills they need to connect to good-paying\njobs in that sector.\nThe Fed supports the work you do in communities because you make a difference.\nYou help ensure that credit is available for families to buy homes and for small\nbusinesses to expand. Your organizations sponsor programs that help make communities\nsafer and families healthier and more financially secure. One of the most important\nthings you do is to help people meet the demands of finding a job in what remains a\nchallenging economy. And that help is crucial, but I also believe it can’t succeed without\ntwo other things.\nThe first of these is the courage and determination of the people you serve. The\npast six years have been difficult for many Americans, but the hardships faced by some\nhave shattered lives and families. Too many people know firsthand how devastating it is\nto lose a job at which you had succeeded and be unable to find another; to run through\nyour savings and even lose your home, as months and sometimes years pass trying to find\n\n- 2 -\nwork; to feel your marriage and other relationships strained and broken by financial\ndifficulties. And yet many of those who have suffered the most find the will to keep\ntrying. I will introduce you to three of these brave men and women, your neighbors here\nin the great city of Chicago. These individuals have benefited from just the kind of help\nfrom community groups that I highlighted a moment ago, and they recently shared their\npersonal stories with me.\nIt might seem obvious, but the second thing that is needed to help people find\njobs…is jobs. No amount of training will be enough if there are not enough jobs to fill. I\nhave mentioned some of the things the Fed does to help communities, but the most\nimportant thing we do is to use monetary policy to promote a stronger economy. The\nFederal Reserve has taken extraordinary steps since the onset of the financial crisis to\nspur economic activity and create jobs, and I will explain why I believe those efforts are\nstill needed.\nThe Fed provides this help by influencing interest rates. Although we work\nthrough financial markets, our goal is to help Main Street, not Wall Street. By keeping\ninterest rates low, we are trying to make homes more affordable and revive the housing\nmarket. We are trying to make it cheaper for businesses to build, expand, and hire. We\nare trying to lower the costs of buying a car that can carry a worker to a new job and kids\nto school, and our policies are also spurring the revival of the auto industry. We are\ntrying to help families afford things they need so that greater spending can drive job\ncreation and even more spending, thereby strengthening the recovery.\n\n- 3 -\nWhen the Federal Reserve’s policies are effective, they improve the welfare of\neveryone who benefits from a stronger economy, most of all those who have been hit\nhardest by the recession and the slow recovery.\nNow let me offer my view of the state of the recovery, with particular attention to\nthe labor market and conditions faced by workers. Nationwide, and in Chicago, the\neconomy and the labor market have strengthened considerably from the depths of the\nGreat Recession. Since the unemployment rate peaked at 10 percent in October 2009, the\neconomy has added more than 7-1/2 million jobs and the unemployment rate has fallen\nmore than 3 percentage points to 6.7 percent. That progress has been gradual but\nremarkably steady--February was the 41st consecutive month of payroll growth, one of\nthe longest stretches ever.\nChicago, as you all know, was hit harder than many areas during the recession\nand remains a tougher market for workers. But there has been considerable improvement\nhere also. Unemployment in the city of Chicago is down from a peak of nearly 13\npercent to about 9-1/2 percent at last count. That is about the same improvement as in the\nlarger Chicago metro area, where unemployment has fallen to 8-1/2 percent. Metro\nChicago has added 183,000 jobs since 2009, just below the rate for job gains nationwide.1\nBut while there has been steady progress, there is also no doubt that the economy\nand the job market are not back to normal health. That will not be news to many of you,\nor to the 348,000 people in and around Chicago who were counted as looking for work in\n1 According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, total nonfarm employment for the Chicago-Joliet-Naperville\nmetropolitan division has increased 183,000 since December 2009, or about 5 percent. Over this period,\nemployment nationally has increased about 6 percent.\n\n- 4 -\nJanuary.2 It will not be news to consumers or to owners of small and medium-sized\nbusinesses, who surveys say remain cautious about the strength and durability of the\nrecovery.\nThe recovery still feels like a recession to many Americans, and it also looks that\nway in some economic statistics. At 6.7 percent, the national unemployment rate is still\nhigher than it ever got during the 2001 recession. That is also the case in Chicago and in\nmany other cities. It certainly feels like a recession to many younger workers, to older\nworkers who lost long-term jobs, and to African Americans, who are facing a job market\ntoday that is nearly as tough as it was during the two downturns that preceded the Great\nRecession.\nIn some ways, the job market is tougher now than in any recession. The numbers\nof people who have been trying to find work for more than six months or more than a\nyear are much higher today than they ever were since records began decades ago. We\nknow that the long-term unemployed face big challenges. Research shows employers are\nless willing to hire the long-term unemployed and often prefer other job candidates with\nless or even no relevant experience.3\nThat is what Dorine Poole learned, after she lost her job processing medical\ninsurance claims, just as the recession was getting started. Like many others, she could\nnot find any job, despite clerical skills and experience acquired over 15 years of steady\nemployment. When employers started hiring again, two years of unemployment became\n2 Bureau of Labor Statistics Local Area Unemployment Statistics for the Chicago-Joliet-Naperville\nmetropolitan division.\n3 See Kory Kroft, Fabian Lange, and Matthew J.

That career, that part of Dorine’s life,\nhad ended.\nFor Dorine and others, we know that workers displaced by layoffs and plant\nclosures who manage to find work suffer long-lasting and often permanent wage\nreductions.4 Jermaine Brownlee was an apprentice plumber and skilled construction\nworker when the recession hit, and he saw his wages drop sharply as he scrambled for\nodd jobs and temporary work. He is doing better now, but still working for a lower wage\nthan he earned before the recession.\nVicki Lira lost her full-time job of 20 years when the printing plant she worked in\nshut down in 2006. Then she lost a job processing mortgage applications when the\nhousing market crashed. Vicki faced some very difficult years. At times she was\nhomeless. Today she enjoys her part-time job serving food samples to customers at a\ngrocery store but wishes she could get more hours.\nVicki Lira is one of many Americans who lost a full-time job in the recession and\nseem stuck working part time. The unemployment rate is down, but not included in that\nrate are more than seven million people who are working part time but want a full-time\njob. As a share of the workforce, that number is very high historically.\n4 See, among others, Louis S. Jacobson, Robert J. LaLonde, and Daniel G. Sullivan (1993), “Earnings\nLosses of Displaced Workers,” American Economic Review, vol. 83 (September), pp. 685-709;\nSteven J.

First, they are a reminder\nthat there are real people behind the statistics, struggling to get by and eager for the\nopportunity to build better lives. Second, their experiences show some of the uniquely\nchallenging and lasting effects of the Great Recession. Recognizing and trying to\nunderstand these effects helps provide a clearer picture of the progress we have made in\nthe recovery, as well as a view of just how far we still have to go.\nAnd based on the evidence available, it is clear to me that the U.S. economy is\nstill considerably short of the two goals assigned to the Federal Reserve by the Congress.\nThe first of those goals is maximum sustainable employment, the highest level of\nemployment that can be sustained while maintaining a stable inflation rate. Most of my\ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee and I estimate that the unemployment\nrate consistent with maximum sustainable employment is now between 5.2 percent and\n5.6 percent, well below the 6.7 percent rate in February.\nThe other goal assigned by the Congress is stable prices, which means keeping\ninflation under control. In the past, there have been times when these two goals\nconflicted--fighting inflation often requires actions that slow the economy and raise the\nunemployment rate. But that is not a dilemma now, because inflation is well below\n2 percent, the Fed’s longer-term goal.\nThe Federal Reserve takes its inflation goal very seriously. One reason why I\nbelieve it is appropriate for the Federal Reserve to continue to provide substantial help to\nthe labor market, without adding to the risks of inflation, is because of the evidence I see\n\n- 7 -\nthat there remains considerable slack in the economy and the labor market. Let me\nexplain what I mean by that word “slack” and why it is so important.\nSlack means that there are significantly more people willing and capable of filling\na job than there are jobs for them to fill. During a period of little or no slack, there still\nmay be vacant jobs and people who want to work, but a large share of those willing to\nwork lack the skills or are otherwise not well suited for the jobs that are available. With\n6.7 percent unemployment, it might seem that there must be a lot of slack in the U.S.\neconomy, but there are reasons why that may not be true.\nOne important reason relates to the skills and education of people in the\nworkforce. It is no secret that America faces some daunting challenges in educating\npeople and preparing them to work in a 21st century, globalized economy. Many of you\nin this audience are helping workers address this challenge, but you also know that the\neconomy continues to change very rapidly.\nTo the extent that people who desire to work lack the skills that employers are\ndemanding, there is less slack in the labor market. This is an example of what\neconomists call “structural” unemployment, and it can be difficult to solve. Even\nunderstanding what workers need to appeal to employers is difficult in a fast-changing\neconomy. For government, effective solutions for structural unemployment, beginning\nwith improved education, tend to be expensive and take a long time to work. The\nproblem goes deeper than simply a lack of jobs.\nBut a lack of jobs is the heart of the problem when unemployment is caused by\nslack, which we also call “cyclical unemployment.” The government has the tools to\naddress cyclical unemployment. Monetary policy is one such tool, and the Federal\n\n- 8 -\nReserve has been actively using it to strengthen the recovery and create jobs, which\nbrings me to why the amount of slack is so important.\nIf unemployment were mostly structural, if workers were unable to perform the\njobs available, then the Federal Reserve’s efforts to create jobs would not be very\neffective. Worse than that, without slack in the labor market, the economic stimulus from\nthe Fed could put attaining our inflation goal at risk. In fact, judging how much slack\nthere is in the labor market is one of the most important questions that my Federal\nReserve colleagues and I consider when making monetary policy decisions, because our\ninflation goal is no less important than the goal of maximum employment.\nThis is not just an academic debate. For Dorine Poole, Jermaine Brownlee, and\nVicki Lira, and for millions of others dislocated by the Great Recession who continue to\nstruggle, the cause of the slow recovery is enormously important. As I said earlier, the\npowerful force that sustains them and others who keep trying to succeed in this recovery\nis the faith that their job prospects will improve and that their efforts will be rewarded.\nNow let me explain why I believe there is still considerable slack in the labor\nmarket, why I think there is room for continued help from the Fed for workers, and why I\nbelieve Dorine Poole, Jermaine Brownlee, and Vicki Lira are right to hope for better days\nahead.\nOne form of evidence for slack is found in other labor market data, beyond the\nunemployment rate or payrolls, some of which I have touched on already. For example,\nthe seven million people who are working part time but would like a full-time job. This\nnumber is much larger than we would expect at 6.7 percent unemployment, based on past\nexperience, and the existence of such a large pool of “partly unemployed” workers is a\n\n- 9 -\nsign that labor conditions are worse than indicated by the unemployment rate. Statistics\non job turnover also point to considerable slack in the labor market. Although firms are\nnow laying off fewer workers, they have been reluctant to increase the pace of hiring.\nLikewise, the number of people who voluntarily quit their jobs is noticeably below levels\nbefore the recession; that is an indicator that people are reluctant to risk leaving their jobs\nbecause they worry that it will be hard to find another. It is also a sign that firms may not\nbe recruiting very aggressively to hire workers away from their competitors.\nA second form of evidence for slack is that the decline in unemployment has not\nhelped raise wages for workers as in past recoveries. Workers in a slack market have\nlittle leverage to demand raises. Labor compensation has increased an average of only a\nlittle more than 2 percent per year since the recession, which is very low by historical\nstandards.5 Wage growth for most workers was modest for a couple of decades before\nthe recession due to globalization and other factors beyond the level of economic activity,\nand those forces are undoubtedly still relevant. But labor market slack has also surely\nbeen a factor in holding down compensation. The low rate of wage growth is, to me,\nanother sign that the Fed’s job is not yet done.\nA third form of evidence related to slack concerns the characteristics of the\nextraordinarily large share of the unemployed who have been out of work for six months\nor more. These workers find it exceptionally hard to find steady, regular work, and they\nappear to be at a severe competitive disadvantage when trying to find a job. The concern\nis that the long-term unemployed may remain on the sidelines, ultimately dropping out of\n5 From 2010 to 2013, average annual growth in compensation per hour, hourly compensation as measured\nin the Employment Cost Index and average hourly earnings for all employees in private industries--all\nindependent estimates of wage and compensation growth--increased annually, on average, no more than 2-\n1/4 percent.\n\n- 10 -\nthe workforce. But the data suggest that the long-term unemployed look basically the\nsame as other unemployed people in terms of their occupations, educational attainment,\nand other characteristics. And, although they find jobs with lower frequency than the\nshort-term jobless do, the rate at which job seekers are finding jobs has only marginally\nimproved for both groups. That is, we have not yet seen clear indications that the short-\nterm unemployed are finding it increasingly easier to find work relative to the long-term\nunemployed. This fact gives me hope that a significant share of the long-term\nunemployed will ultimately benefit from a stronger labor market.\nA final piece of evidence of slack in the labor market has been the behavior of the\nparticipation rate--the proportion of working-age adults that hold or are seeking jobs.\nParticipation falls in a slack job market when people who want a job give up trying to\nfind one. When the recession began, 66 percent of the working-age population was part\nof the labor force. Participation dropped, as it normally does in a recession, but then kept\ndropping in the recovery. It now stands at 63 percent, the same level as in 1978, when a\nmuch smaller share of women were in the workforce. Lower participation could mean\nthat the 6.7 percent unemployment rate is overstating the progress in the labor market.\nOne factor lowering participation is the aging of the population, which means that\nan increasing share of the population is retired. If demographics were the only or\noverwhelming reason for falling participation, then declining participation would not be a\nsign of labor market slack. But some “retirements” are not voluntary, and some of these\nworkers may rejoin the labor force in a stronger economy. Participation rates have been\nfalling broadly for workers of different ages, including many in the prime of their\nworking lives. Based on the evidence, my own view is that a significant amount of the\n\n- 11 -\ndecline in participation during the recovery is due to slack, another sign that help from\nthe Fed can still be effective.\nSince late 2008, the Fed has taken extraordinary steps to revive the economy. At\nthe height of the crisis, we provided liquidity to help avert a collapse of the financial\nsystem, which enabled banks and other institutions to continue to provide credit to people\nand businesses depending on it. We cut short-term interest rates as low as they can go\nand indicated that we would keep them low for as long as necessary to support a stronger\neconomic recovery. And we have been purchasing large quantities of longer-term\nsecurities in order to put additional downward pressure on longer-term interest rates--the\nrates that matter to people shopping for a new car, looking to buy or renovate a home, or\nexpand a business. There is little doubt that without these actions, the recession and slow\nrecovery would have been far worse.\nThese different measures have the same goal--to encourage consumers to spend\nand businesses to invest, to promote a recovery in the housing market, and to put more\npeople to work. Together they represent an unprecedentedly large and sustained\ncommitment by the Fed to do what is necessary to help our nation recover from the Great\nRecession. For the many reasons I have noted today, I think this extraordinary\ncommitment is still needed and will be for some time, and I believe that view is widely\nshared by my fellow policymakers at the Fed.\nIn this context, recent steps by the Fed to reduce the rate of new securities\npurchases are not a lessening of this commitment, only a judgment that recent progress in\nthe labor market means our aid for the recovery need not grow as quickly. Earlier this\n\n- 12 -\nmonth, the Fed reiterated its overall commitment to maintain extraordinary support for\nthe recovery for some time to come.\nThis commitment is strong, and I believe the Fed’s policies will continue to help\nsustain progress in the job market. But the scars from the Great Recession remain, and\nreaching our goals will take time. In the meanwhile, the Federal Reserve will continue to\nexpand its efforts to promote community development. The Board and each of the\n12 Reserve Banks have community development staff members who focus on improving\nthe availability of financial services in low- and moderate-income communities. They\nhelp bankers comply with the Community Reinvestment Act, but they are also a source\nof research and a facilitator of communication among financial institutions and\npractitioners to identify and share best practices.\nThis conference is one example of how the Fed pursues those goals, and I would\nlike to mention a few of the Fed’s other community development initiatives that I find\nparticularly promising. In 2012, The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco partnered\nwith the Low Income Investment Fund (LIIF), a community development financial\ninstitution that bridges the gap between low-income neighborhoods and private capital\nsources, to publish the book Investing in What Works for America’s Communities. This\nbook cited innovative and effective community development initiatives across the\ncountry and advocated for a “Community Quarterback” model to coordinate initiatives\nand better leverage funding among groups with similar goals.\nIn a similar way, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston has been the catalyst for the\nWorking Cities Challenge, inspired by its own research on cities that managed to\ndiversify away from a declining, manufacturing-based economy. The research found that\n\n- 13 -\none key to success is “collaborative leadership,” when governments, businesses, and\nnonprofits unite behind one focused approach. The Working Cities Challenge promotes\nthat principle by inviting smaller Massachusetts cities to consider how they would use\ncollaborative leadership to unite their communities to address a major challenge for\nlower-income residents. Twenty cities competed for $1.8 million in funding from the\nstate and other sources. Six cities were awarded funds this past January, but many more\nwill benefit from the spread of a new approach to capacity building that Fed research\nshows helps communities thrive.\nLeadership recruitment is also at the heart of a grassroots-oriented program called\nEconomic Avenue that was developed by the Kansas City Fed. In Northeast Kansas City,\nKansas, residents and neighborhood leaders are forming a leadership council that will\nhave responsibility for managing the program, which aims to create and grow local\nbusinesses, create jobs, and promote homeownership. The bank’s community\ndevelopment staff is providing education and training to get the council off the ground,\nwill measure and evaluate its progress, and assist in connecting leaders to resources and\nother programs.\nThese examples are just a few among many throughout the Federal Reserve\nSystem. By testing ideas, developing better measurement tools, convening interested\nparties, and sharing the Federal Reserve’s skills and knowledge with our partners at the\nnational and local levels, we aim to serve as a catalyst to improve lives.\nThrough these initiatives, together with the use of monetary policy and steps to\nsafeguard the financial system, the Federal Reserve is committed to strengthening\ncommunities and restoring a healthy economy that benefits all Americans. It is my hope\n\n- 14 -\nthat the courageous and determined working people I have told you about today, and\nmillions more, will get the chance they deserve to build better lives.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n8:45 a.m. EDT\nSeptember 18, 2014\nRemarks by\nJanet L. Yellen\nChair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n2014 Assets Learning Conference\nof the\nCorporation for Enterprise Development\nWashington, D.C.\nSeptember 18, 2014\n\nThank you for this opportunity to show my support for the work all of you do on\nasset-building, and to say a few words on this vitally important topic.\nThe financial crisis and the Great Recession demonstrated, in a dramatic and\nunmistakable manner, how extraordinarily vulnerable are the large share of American\nfamilies with very few assets to fall back on. We have come far from the worst moments\nof the crisis, and the economy continues to improve. But the effects of the recession are\nstill being felt by many families, particularly those that had very little in savings and\nother assets beforehand.\nTo help make this point, I’d like to cite a few numbers from the Federal Reserve’s\n2013 Survey of Consumer Finances, published earlier this month. The Survey is\nconducted every three years and this new edition provides one of the first good looks at\nhow families in different economic circumstances have fared in the recovery.\nFor lower-income families, what we find is sobering. The median net worth\nreported by the bottom fifth of households by income was only $6,400 in 2013. Among\nthis group, representing about 25 million American households, many families had no\nwealth or had negative net worth. The next fifth of households by income had median\nnet worth of just $27,900. These numbers represent declines from 2010. One reason is\nthat income has continued to fall for these families.\nAnother likely reason for this decline in net worth is the lingering effects of the\nhousing crisis. Home equity accounts for the lion’s share of wealth for most families and\nmany of these families have not yet recovered the wealth they lost in the housing crisis.\nThe housing market is improving and housing will remain an important channel for asset\nbuilding for lower and middle income families. But one of the lessons of the crisis,\n\n- 2 -\nwhich will not be news to many of you, is the importance of diversification and\nespecially of possessing savings and other liquid financial assets to fall back in times of\neconomic distress.\nYet for lower and middle income families, financial assets, including 401 (k)\nplans and pensions, are still a very small share of their assets. According to the 2013\nsurvey, the bottom half of families by income held only 8 percent of all financial assets\nheld by households.\nA larger lesson from the financial crisis, of course, is how important it is to\npromote asset-building, including saving for a rainy day, as protection from the ups and\ndowns of the economy. I surely hope that our nation will not face another crisis anytime\nsoon as severe as the one we recently experienced. But for many lower-income families\nwithout assets, the definition of a financial crisis is a month or two without a paycheck, or\nthe advent of a sudden illness or some other unexpected expense. Families with assets to\ndraw on are able to deal with these developments as bumps in the road. Families without\nthese assets can end up, very suddenly, off the road. According to the Board’s recent\nSurvey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking, an unexpected expense of just\n$400 would prompt the majority of households to borrow money, sell something, or\nsimply not pay at all.\nThe Federal Reserve’s mission is to promote a healthy economy and strong\nfinancial system, and that is why we have promoted and will continue to promote asset-\nbuilding. One way we do this is through the Community Development programs at each\nof our 12 Reserve Banks, and through the Federal Reserve Board’s Division of Consumer\nand Community Affairs in Washington. As a research institution, and a convener of\n\n- 3 -\nstakeholders involved in community development, I believe the Fed can help you in\ncarrying out your mission, to encourage families to take the small steps that over time can\nlead to the accumulation of considerable assets.\nThank you for the chance to be a small part of this conference, and for your\ncommitment to a cause that I strongly support.",

    "text": "Speech to a Community Outreach Luncheon\nBoise, Idaho\nBy Janet L. Yellen, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery September 7, 2006 – 12:40 PM Mountain Time, 2:40 PM Eastern\nProspects for the U.S. Economy\nGood afternoon. I'm delighted to be with you today. I'd like to start by saying\nhow much I appreciate the very warm welcome we've received here, especially from\nmany of our past and present Directors. They have done a great job of arranging for us to\nsee some of the highlights of your beautiful city. High on the list, of course, was the\nBasque Museum, which reflects the many cultural and economic contributions Basque\nimmigrants and their descendants have made to this area and, indeed, to the nation.\nUnfortunately, that tour was scheduled during our Board meeting, so I had to miss it. My\nenvy was soothed a bit, though, because I was able to attend a special presentation and\ndemonstration of the research being done at the Center for Ecohydraulic Research at the\nIdaho Water Center, clearly a worldclass scientific research facility. So, all in all, I have\nto agree with what Money Magazine had to say recently about Boise: It definitely\ndeserves its ranking among the top ten \"Best Places to Live\" in the country.\nAlthough I obviously get a lot of personal pleasure out of traveling around the\nDistrict to places like Boise, I'm also here for important official reasons. One of the great\nstrengths of the Federal Reserve is its connection to the citizenry of the country. In this\nrespect, the twelve Reserve Banks play a particularly important role. Through our\ndirectors, our advisory councils, and through meetings like this one, we can get some\ninsight into the public's viewpoint on issues that are vital to the conduct of monetary\npolicy—issues like labor market conditions, expectations about inflation, and industry-\n\nspecific developments, to name just a few. So I'm very much looking forward to the\nquestion and answer session that will follow my remarks, because I'm sure that I'm going\nto learn from you as much as you're going to learn from me!\nMy remarks today will focus on conditions in the U.S. economy and their\nimplications for monetary policy. But before I begin, let me note that my comments\nrepresent my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal\nReserve System.\nThe last time I spoke publicly was a little more than a month ago. Since then,\nsomething unusual happened. After raising short-term interest rates at every one of its 17\nmeetings beginning in June 2004, the Federal Open Market Committee decided not to\ntighten the stance of monetary policy at its last meeting, which was last month. As a\nmatter of fact, the August meeting was the first since I became President of the Federal\nReserve Bank of San Francisco that the Committee didn't raise rates. The August pause\nmay seem a bit puzzling to some, since we had some rather bad news on inflation for\nseveral months in a row. Today, I'd like to focus my remarks on why I think the pause\nwas a good idea, and, of course, in following that theme, I'll need to get into the prospects\nfor the U.S. economy.\nI'll start with a quick review of recent developments. The U.S. economy has\nsuffered some significant shocks in the past couple of years: in particular, a sustained\nsurge in energy prices and the devastation from the twin hurricanes just over a year ago.\nDespite these challenges, the economy grew at a solid clip, averaging just over 3¼\npercent for the past two years.\n\nThis pace of growth is moderately above current estimates of the growth rate that\nis sustainable in the long run, and it has lasted long enough to eliminate much of the slack\nin labor and product markets that was apparent a year ago. Over that time, both the rate\nof unused capacity in the industrial sector and the civilian unemployment rate have fallen\nnoticeably. Indeed, the unemployment rate dropped by about three-fourths of a\npercentage point, coming in at 4¾ percent in August. This rate is actually a little bit\nlower than conventional estimates of so-called \"full employment,\" and therefore suggests\nthat there may be some tightness in labor markets.\nTurning to inflation, the recent news, as I said, hasn't been what I'd like to see.\nHeadline inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index,\nshowed an increase of three and a half percent over the twelve months ending in July.\nWhile this is an important and comprehensive index of changes in the cost of living, the\nCommittee also focuses on a different measure—the core number, which excludes the\nvolatile food and energy components—because it is a better indicator of underlying\ntrends in inflation. This measure rose at an uncomfortably high rate of nearly 2½ percent\nover the past year. Although it is encouraging that the rate has edged down recently, it\nhas remained a bit above my \"comfort zone\"—a range between one and two percent that I\nconsider an appropriate long-run inflation objective for the Fed.\nWith labor and product markets close to full utilization and inflation above the\ncomfort zone, one of the key questions for policy is whether economic growth will\nproceed at a moderate enough rate, and stay there long enough, to avoid a sustained\nbuildup of inflationary pressures. And that is my next topic.\nProspects for Economic Activity\n\nRecent data suggest that the needed slowdown is indeed underway. After hitting\na rapid 5½ percent pace in the first quarter, real GDP growth slowed in the second quarter\nto a rate of just under 3 percent. In looking ahead to the rest of the year, I see factors\nworking both to support economic activity and to restrain it somewhat. Taken together,\nthese lead me to expect that we'll probably see growth that is healthy, but somewhat\nbelow the rate that is sustainable in the long run.\nThe factors working to support growth include ongoing strength in business\ndemand, fueling relatively rapid growth in spending on nonresidential structures as well\nas in business investment in equipment and software. This sector, of course, includes\nhigh-tech industries, which are important to Boise. To the extent that business\ninvestments in computer equipment continue to grow, this will help sustain your area's\nrapid economic expansion, which has been propelled in part by the success of local high-\ntech companies in recent years.\nAs for factors that could restrain the nation's growth, one immediately thinks of\nenergy prices, which have surged over the past couple of years. This increase has been\ndue to developments on both the demand and the supply sides of the market. Demand for\nenergy has been quite strong, not only from industrial economies, but also from emerging\nmarkets, most notably, China. On the supply side, there are reports of limited capacity to\nexpand production, not to mention extraordinary events that threaten to restrict supply,\nlike disruptions in the Middle East.\nIt appears that the resulting higher energy prices have restrained consumer\nspending, even while offsets from job gains, as well as growth in wages and wealth have\nkept it rising overall. Of course, further increases in energy prices could imply some\n\nadditional restraint. However, futures markets expect energy prices to stabilize around\ncurrent levels. If they do, then the restraint we've felt this year should evaporate over\n2007, and that could actually contribute to a pickup in growth next year. But that's a very\nbig \"if.\" The fact is that futures markets haven't done such a hot job at predicting where\nthese prices are headed. Ever since energy prices started to rise in 2004, futures markets\nhave usually predicted a relatively flat path going forward. When oil was $30 a barrel,\nthey implied the price would flatten out. At $40 a barrel, they implied the price would\nflatten out. At $50 a barrel—well, you get the picture. And here we are with oil\nfluctuating around $70 a barrel. So energy prices are a bit of a wildcard.\nAnother factor restraining growth is the rise in interest rates over the past couple\nof years as the Fed has removed monetary policy accommodation. Since this process\nbegan in mid-2004, short- and intermediate-term interest rates are up substantially. Long-\nterm rates present a more mixed picture, with some—such as mortgage rates—up\nslightly, and others down slightly. The overall effect of these rate changes should be to\nreduce demand, particularly in interest-sensitive sectors, such as autos, consumer\ndurables, and housing.\nIndeed, we already have seen clear evidence of cooling in the housing sector.\nNationally, housing permits are down noticeably—by more than 20 percent—from a year\nago. In addition, inventories of unsold houses are up significantly, sales of new and\nexisting homes are off their peaks, and surveys of homebuyers and builders are showing\nmuch more pessimistic attitudes. Even in a market that has been as hot as Boise's, some\nrecent evidence points to cooling in the pace of home sales and residential construction\nactivity.\n\nThe national data on residential investment reflect all of these developments and\nenter directly into the calculation of real GDP growth. After adjusting for inflation, (real)\nresidential investment dropped at nearly a 10 percent annual rate in the second quarter\nfollowing two small declines in the prior two quarters.\nThe effects of the housing slowdown go beyond their direct contribution to GDP.\nIn particular, what happens to house prices could have important effects on consumer\nspending, which is a very big part of the economy—roughly 70 percent. As we all know,\nthe pace of house-price appreciation has definitely moderated, after rising at heart-\nstopping rates in recent years. And there are signs that it may continue. For example,\nrents are finally moving up more vigorously after a long period of stagnation. This may\nreflect, in part, expectations that house-price appreciation will continue to slow, as\nlandlords raise rents to try to maintain the total rate of return on rental properties and as\nthose in the market for housing grow more inclined to rent than to buy.\nSlower increases in house prices could weaken consumer spending in a couple of\nways. Both of them have to do with what I'm going to call the \"piggy bank\"\nphenomenon. To be honest, I've stolen this term from some news stories I've seen, but I\nthink the crime is worth it because the description is apt. Back when house prices were\nrising so fast, people saw that more and more equity was being built up in their house\nvalues; in other words, they saw their houses as piggy banks that got fuller and fuller,\nfaster and faster, by just sitting there. Insofar as the piggybank of house value makes up\na good chunk of many households' portfolios, they might well have felt that they could\nafford to spend pretty freely. In economic terms, this is called the \"wealth effect.\" A\nsecond factor stimulating spending relates to the ease with which households can now\n\npull money out of the piggy bank. With home equity loans, refinancings, and so on, the\npiggy bank is now pretty simple to access. So it's no surprise that homeowners seized the\nopportunity and drew some of the money out to support their spending. Now, with the\npace of house-price appreciation slowing, of course, the piggy bank is not getting so full\nso fast anymore, which may weaken the growth in consumer spending.\nWhile it's likely that the slowdown in the housing sector will have only\nmoderating effects on economic activity and will continue to unfold in an orderly way, I\nshould note that we can't ignore the risk that a more unpleasant scenario might develop.\nIn particular, we have heard a lot in recent years about the possibility that there is a\nhouse-price \"bubble,\" implying that prices got out of line with the fundamental value of\nhouses and that the current softening could be just the beginning of a steep fall. While I\ndoubt that we'll see anything like a \"popping of the bubble\"—in part because I'm not\nconvinced there is a bubble, at least on a national level—it is a risk we have to watch out\nfor.\nAnother risk has to do with household saving behavior. In the U.S., the personal\nsaving rate has been declining for more than a decade. During the 1980s, it averaged 9\npercent. This July, it was all the way down to minus 1 percent. Frankly, it's hard to see\nhow it could go much lower. So the risk is that a sustained rise could occur, which would\nput a real crimp in consumer spending and therefore in overall economic activity.\nThough there's some uncertainty about why the saving rate has fallen into negative\nterritory, I strongly suspect that part of it is related to the growth in consumer wealth over\nthe last several years both through rising housing values and through rising stock values.\nTherefore, the more recent softening in both of those sources of wealth may provide a bit\n\nmore impetus for a reversal in the saving trend; in other words, it is conceivable that\npeople will shift gears and try to build up savings the old-fashioned way, by spending\nless. Whatever its source, the very low—in fact, negative—saving rate represents a\ndownside risk for the economy, with the chance of sizeable drop-off in consumer\nspending likely to be bigger than a surge in spending.\nProspects for Inflation\nThis brings me to the outlook for inflation. As I've indicated, core consumer\ninflation has been a bit above my comfort zone recently. Therefore, in keeping with the\nCommittee's responsibilities for promoting price stability for the nation, I believe it is\ncritical that inflation trend in a downward direction over the medium term. Indeed, my\nexpectation is that this is the most likely outcome.\nThat said, I must admit that I'm also less sanguine than I was a month ago about\none particular factor in the inflation process—namely, labor compensation. This factor is\na major component of business costs and can therefore affect the prices that firms charge\nfor their products. A month ago it appeared that compensation was growing quite\nmodestly. Moreover, for nonfarm businesses, markups of product prices over costs have\nbeen near historic highs, which means that businesses have had room to absorb higher\ncosts rather than passing them on to their customers. These two developments together\ngave me considerable comfort in thinking about the inflation outlook. However, recently\nrevised information on compensation per hour suggests that wages and benefits are\ngrowing rapidly. This blurs the picture considerably, since another measure, the\nEmployment Cost Index, shows only moderate growth. Of course, we also look for\ninformation about labor markets from people around the District. Here in Idaho, our\n\ncontacts tell us that they have noticed shortages of skilled workers, and they also are\nseeing increasing difficulties recruiting unskilled workers, all of which has put strong\nupward pressure on wages in the state. While reports like these do heighten my sense of\nconcern, I still draw some comfort from the fact that markups remain very high. So, even\nwith more cost pressures, firms would have the room to absorb the increases without\nfully passing them on into their prices if competitive conditions in product markets\ninduced them to do so.\nBeyond this, I would point to several factors that could make inflationary\npressures recede. The first factor I want to discuss is a somewhat technical point. Try to\nbear with me on this, because it does matter. In statistical analyses of inflation, the data\nhistorically have exhibited persistence. This basically means that, when you're\nforecasting inflation, it works pretty well to assume that the rate in the future will be the\nsame as it is today. The implication of persistence is frankly worrisome: Since inflation\nis too high today, persistence implies it could stay too high for an extended period.\nHowever, recent research at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco has shed\nnew light on this issue. 1 It finds less evidence of persistence during the past ten years.\nThat is, rather than sticking at a certain rate, inflation has tended to revert to its long-run\naverage, which, over that period, is within my comfort zone. Admittedly, the past ten\nyears constitute a relatively small sample from which to draw definitive conclusions.\nNonetheless, this evidence is important because, if it holds up, it implies that inflation\nmay move down from its elevated level faster than many forecasters expect.\n1 John C. Williams, “The Phillips Curve in an Era of Well-Anchored Inflation Expectations,” unpublished\npaper, http://www.frbsf.org/economics/economists/staff.php?jwilliams.\n\nInterestingly, this apparent decline in the persistence of core inflation has\noccurred at roughly the same time that long-run inflation expectations appear to have\nbecome well anchored. The behavior of long-run inflation expectations can serve as a\nkind of proxy for the Fed's credibility as an inflation-fighter. For example, in the face of\nthe large energy price increases we've seen in recent years, this credibility shows up in\nthe stability of survey and market measures of inflation expectations covering the period\nfive-to-ten years ahead. This may not be a coincidence. Research suggests that if a\ncentral bank's commitment to price stability has gained credibility with the public, then\nthe persistence observed in the inflation data will tend to be dampened.\nI would like to stress that our Bank's recent research on persistence concerns\nsimple correlations in the inflation data that can be used for forecasting only, and it does\nnot necessarily inform us about how policy decisions affect the economy or about the\nbest course for policy. In other words, low persistence is no reason for the Fed to rest on\nits laurels of credibility. Rather, credibility is something that neither I—nor my\ncolleagues—take for granted for a moment. We know full well that maintaining\ncredibility requires that we act when necessary to keep inflation under control.\nAnother reason to expect inflationary pressures to lessen has to do with energy\nprices and what is called \"passthrough.\" Even though higher energy prices do not seem\nto have boosted long-term inflation expectations, the energy shock may have been passed\nthrough to recent results for core inflation itself. This might seem surprising, since core\ninflation excludes energy prices. But even so, it is possible that higher energy prices\nhave passed through into the prices of core goods that use energy as an input to\nproduction—airfares are a good example. Now it's true that recent research suggests that\n\nthe extent of passthrough for any given rise in energy prices has been lower in the past\ntwenty-five years than it was back in the 1970s. However, it seems likely that energy\npassthrough probably has played at least some role in recent core inflation movements.\nIn this case, if energy prices level out, as expected by futures markets, this upward\npressure on core inflation is likely to dissipate at some point, and this would help on the\ninflation front.\nFinally, as I've explained, the economy appears to have entered a period of\nslightly below-trend growth. If it continues, as I think is likely, it would tend to moderate\nany underlying inflationary pressures over time. This factor, together with the others I've\ndiscussed, provides reason to think that the most likely outcome is that inflation will\nmove gradually lower. However, I am keenly aware that this pattern has yet to show up\nin the data. The inflation outlook remains highly uncertain, and until we actually see\ninflation begin to slow down, I will be focused on the notable upside risks in the outlook.\nPolicy issues\nThis leads me to the concluding topic in my presentation today—monetary policy.\nAs you know, in August the FOMC decided not to raise the funds rate for the first time in\nmore than two years. I think this was the prudent course of action that properly balances\nthe dual mandate given to the Fed by Congress—to foster price stability and maximum\nsustainable employment.\nGiven that inflation is outside of my comfort zone, why do I think it makes sense\nto pause? In these circumstances, it might be thought that policy should continue to\ntighten until the inflation data move back to a rate consistent with price stability. But I\n\nwould argue that a gradual approach is likely to be better because there is a need to\nincorporate lags between policy actions and effects on the economy. We don't know\nwhat the lags are with precision, but we still need to do the best we can to take them into\naccount. We simply don't get the necessary feedback on the effects of our policy actions\nfor a long time. So if we kept automatically raising rates until we saw inflation start to\nrespond, we most likely would have gone too far, which would unnecessarily endanger\nthe economic expansion. Instead we need to be forward-looking.\nAnd, by a variety of measures, it appears that the current stance of policy will\nmove inflation gradually back to the comfort zone while giving due consideration to the\nrisks to economic activity. By a variety measures, I'm referring to my forecast that I have\noutlined today, as well as the recommendations from commonly used monetary policy\nrules that are used to gauge the stance of policy. Taken as a whole, these rules indicate\nthat the funds rate is currently within the range that appears appropriate, given the current\ncondition of the labor market and the position of inflation relative to my comfort zone.\nHowever, since all such approaches are inherently imprecise, policy must be\nresponsive to the data as it emerges. The advantage of pausing is that it allows us more\ntime to observe the data. When I say that policy should be responsive to the data, I mean\nthat any additional firming should depend on how emerging developments affect the\neconomic outlook. And when I say data, I don't just mean data on inflation, output, and\nemployment. I also mean data on factors that might affect those variables in the future—\nsuch as energy prices, the dollar, the stock market, long-term interest rates, housing\nprices and inflation expectations.\n\nThe bottom line is this. With inflation too high, policy must have a bias toward\nfurther firming. However, our past actions have already put a lot of firming in the\npipeline. With the lags in policy we haven't yet seen the full effect of our past actions.\nThese will unfold gradually over time. By pausing, we allowed ourselves more time to\nobserve the data and more time to gauge how much, if any, additional firming is needed\nto pursue our dual mandate.\nThank you for having me today, and I will be pleased to address your questions.\n# # #",

    "text": "December 01, 2010\n\nVice Chair Janet L. Yellen\n\nAt the Committee for Economic Development 2010 International Counterparts Conference, New York, New York\n\nGood morning.  Thank you for inviting me to be with you today.  The Committee for Economic Development has a long and distinguished record in identifying and addressing crucial issues related to our nation's economic growth and productivity.  And today's conference on fiscal sustainability and the global economy fits squarely within that tradition.  My remarks will focus on the challenges faced by U.S. policymakers as they confront the need to put fiscal policy on a sustainable track in the long term while providing support to the economy in the near term.  I will also offer some thoughts on the recent actions undertaken by the Federal Reserve and on the implications of our nation's fiscal and monetary policy choices for the global economy. 1\n\nThe Challenge of Achieving Fiscal Sustainability in the United States Charting a sensible course for the federal budget is an essential but formidable task for U.S. policymakers.  Since the onset of the recent recession and financial crisis, the federal budget deficit has soared as the weak economy has depressed revenues and pushed up expenditures and as necessary policy actions have been taken to help ease the recession and shore up the financial system.  At 9 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), the budget deficit in fiscal year 2010 was a little lower than it had been a year earlier, but it was still considerably above the average of 2 percent of GDP during the pre-crisis period from fiscal 2005 to 2007.  As a result of the recent deficits, federal debt held by the public has increased to around 60 percent of GDP--a level not seen in 60 years.\n\nFor now, the budget deficit seems to have topped out.  So long as the economy and financial markets continue to recover, the deficit should narrow relative to GDP over the next few years as a growing economy boosts revenues and reduces safety-net expenditures and as the policies put in place to provide economic stimulus and promote financial stability wind down.  That said, the budget situation over the longer run presents some very difficult challenges, in part because the aging of the U.S. population implies a sizable and sustained increase in the share of the population receiving benefits from Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.  Currently, there are about five individuals between the ages of 20 and 64 for each person aged 65 and older.  This ratio is projected to decline to around three by the time most of the baby boomers have retired in 2030, and further increases in average life expectancies may push this ratio down a little more in the years after that.  Moreover, the demographic pressures on the budget appear likely to be compounded by continued large increases in per capita spending on health care.  Admittedly, the ability of budget analysts to forecast the trajectory of health-care spending is limited, but it is prudent to assume that federal health spending per beneficiary will continue to rise faster than per capita GDP for the foreseeable future.\n\nIn a nutshell, the problem is that, in the absence of significant policy changes, and under reasonable assumptions about economic growth, demographics, and medical costs, federal spending will rise significantly faster than federal tax revenues in coming years.  As a result, if current policy settings are maintained, the budget will be on an unsustainable path, with the ratio of federal debt held by the public to national income rising rapidly.\n\nA failure to address these fiscal challenges would expose the United States to serious economic costs and risks.  A high and rising level of government debt relative to national income is likely to eventually put upward pressure on interest rates, thereby restraining capital formation, productivity, and economic growth.  Indeed, once the economy has recovered from its downturn, fiscal deficits will crowd out private spending.  Large fiscal deficits will also likely put upward pressure on our current account deficits with the rest of the world; the associated greater reliance on borrowing from abroad means that an increasing share of our future income will be required to make interest payments on federal debt held abroad, thereby reducing the amount of income available for domestic spending and investment.  A large federal debt will also limit the ability and flexibility of policymakers to address future economic stresses and other emergencies, a risk that is underscored by the critical fiscal policy actions that were taken to buffer the effects of the recent recession and stabilize financial markets in the wake of the crisis.  And a prolonged failure by policymakers to address America's fiscal challenges could eventually undermine confidence in U.S. economic management.\n\nI do not underestimate the difficulty of crafting a long-range budget plan that will both garner sufficient political support and have sound economic foundations.  The reactions to the proposals offered by members of the President's National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, as well as to those offered by other prominent groups, provide ample evidence of the differences that must be bridged.  Nonetheless, I am encouraged that the debate seems to be moving forward and is starting to touch on some broad principles that--if followed--would improve economic growth and make achieving sustainable fiscal policies at least somewhat easier.  Perhaps the most fundamental question that must be faced concerns the size and scope of the federal government--that is, how much of the nation's economic resources we will devote to federal programs, including transfer programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.  Crucially, whatever size of government we choose, taxes must ultimately be set at a level sufficient to achieve an appropriate balance of spending and revenues.\n\nWe should not defer charting a course for fiscal consolidation.  Timely enactment of a plan to eliminate future unsustainable budget gaps will make it easier for individuals and businesses to prepare for and adjust to the changes.  Moreover, the sooner we start addressing the longer-term budget problem, the less wrenching the adjustment will have to be and the more control we--rather than market forces or international creditors--will have over the timing, size, and composition of the necessary adjustments.\n\nThat said, it is important to recognize that fiscal tightening, were it to occur prematurely, could retard an already tepid economic recovery.  We need, and I believe there is scope for, an approach to fiscal policy that puts in place a well-timed and credible plan to bring deficits down to sustainable levels over the medium and long terms while also addressing the economy's short-term needs.\n\nUnfortunately, U.S. economic performance continues to be impaired by the lingering effects of the financial crisis.  The economy remains far from full employment even though a year and a half has elapsed since the trough of the business cycle.  Job gains have continued to be subpar, and the unemployment rate remains near its highest level since the early 1980s; moreover, given the slow pace of economic growth, unemployment is likely to remain high for some time.  Meanwhile, measures of underlying inflation have continued to trend lower and are now below the levels the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) judges to be consistent, over the longer run, with its statutory mandate of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nIn this context, the Federal Reserve decided at its November meeting to undertake additional monetary policy actions to satisfy its dual mandate.  After weighing carefully the uncertainties and risks, the FOMC decided to further expand the Federal Reserve's holdings of longer-term Treasury securities.  The objective of this action is to reduce longer-term interest rates, thereby promoting a stronger pace of economic growth.  The purchase of longer-term securities, while in some ways \"unconventional,\" is actually quite similar to the Fed's traditional approach to monetary policy, which involves lowering the overnight federal funds rate by increasing the supply of reserve balances. With the federal funds rate now effectively pinned at zero, purchases of longer-term securities are intended to push down rates further out the yield curve.  By bolstering activity in the United States and mitigating risks that could threaten the recovery, this policy should also provide support for a sustained expansion of the global economy.\n\nIn announcing its intention to purchase an additional $600 billion of longer-term Treasury securities, the FOMC committed to review the purchase program regularly in light of incoming information and to make adjustments as needed to meet our objectives.  The Committee, of course, recognizes that at the appropriate time, as the economy more fully recovers, the Federal Reserve will need to remove this extraordinary monetary accommodation in order to maintain price stability and keep inflation expectations well anchored.  I am confident that the Federal Reserve has both the commitment and the tools to achieve this unwinding.\n\nI strongly supported the Federal Reserve's recent action because I believe it will be helpful in strengthening the recovery.  But it is hardly a panacea.  Thus, a fiscal program that combines a focus on pro-growth policies in the near term with concrete steps to reduce longer-term budget deficits could be a valuable complement to our efforts.  Indeed, some budget experts are exploring the idea of explicitly coupling fiscal stimulus in the near term, when unemployment is high and resource utilization is low, with specific deficit-reducing actions that take effect at scheduled future times, when output and employment are expected to have moved closer to their potential.  Although a plan of this type might be challenging to develop and implement, it could provide an effective means to support economic activity in the short run while moving toward fiscal sustainability over time.\n\nInternational Implications of U.S. Policy Choices Because the focus of this conference is on fiscal adjustments and the global economy, let me now try to place this discussion of U.S. fiscal and monetary policies into the current international context.  The process of long-run fiscal consolidation in the United States would likely entail higher national saving relative to investment, which should have the direct effect of restraining U.S. imports and shrinking the U.S. trade deficit.  More generally, by lowering interest rates, fiscal consolidation should diminish net capital inflows into the United States, thereby reducing the current account deficit in this country and current account surpluses elsewhere.  The resulting pattern of international debt accumulation and capital flows would be more balanced than at present, promoting a more sustainable pattern of growth in the global economy.  Indeed, such a rebalancing program was strongly endorsed by the leaders of the Group of Twenty at their recent meeting in Seoul.\n\nAlthough the fiscal consolidation process is just beginning, the weakness of private demand in the United States and other advanced economies, combined with robust growth in the emerging market economies, has led to a two-speed global recovery that already is creating pressures toward rebalancing.  The advanced economies started their recoveries in 2009, but economic growth has barely exceeded the growth rate of potential output; as a result, the level of output in most advanced economies, including the United States, is still well below its potential.  Forecasts suggest that growth and resource utilization will remain lackluster in the advanced economies for some time.  Furthermore, inflation pressures in most other advanced countries, as in the United States, remain quite low, reflecting the existence of substantial economic slack.\n\nIn contrast to the subdued pace of recovery in the advanced economies, economic activity in the emerging market economies has rebounded sharply, and the level of output in most of those economies now well exceeds pre-crisis levels.  The consequence is that policymakers in emerging market countries have turned their attention to the threat of rising inflation and have begun tightening monetary policy.\n\nThe stronger growth prospects in the emerging market economies, coupled with the tightening stance of their monetary policies, appear to be contributing to a resurgence of capital inflows to these economies.  Sizeable differentials in expected returns between advanced and emerging market economies also seem to be reinforcing these flows and causing emerging market currencies to rise.  In light of their increasing concerns about inflation, a case can be made that emerging market policymakers should welcome currency appreciation because it reduces inflation pressures and, over time, aids global rebalancing.  However, some of them have argued that unduly large and rapid capital inflows may lead to asset-price bubbles and expose the financial sectors in their economies to a subsequent reversal of these flows, while rapid currency appreciation could derail the growth of their export sectors.  A number of emerging market economies have accordingly attempted to counter the effects of financial inflows through a range of policies, including foreign exchange intervention and capital controls.\n\nThe U.S. fiscal program that I discussed earlier might also moderate the pressures emerging market economies are experiencing at present.  Stronger U.S. growth would boost our demand for foreign goods and reduce the incentives for capital flows to emerging markets, thereby diminishing some of the upward pressure on emerging market currencies.  Thus, the U.S. fiscal program would lessen for a time the natural mechanisms pushing the emerging markets to rebalance their economies toward domestic demand, even as it helped put the global economy as a whole on a more solid footing.  However, such developments would in no way diminish the need for such rebalancing in the medium term.  It is also important for both advanced and emerging market economies to begin planning now for the structural reforms that will eventually be needed to promote rebalancing.\n\nConclusion As I hope I've made clear, the challenge for U.S. policymakers will be to craft a strategy that puts our fiscal policy on a sustainable path in the longer term while helping support the recovery in economic activity in the near term.  These goals are challenging to achieve but not inconsistent.  Moreover, making progress on them would not only provide important benefits to the United States; it would also help foster a stronger world economy in the near term and a better global balance in spending, production, saving, and borrowing over time.\n\n1.

    "text": "May 06, 2011\n\nVice Chair Janet L. Yellen\n\nAt the Bank of Finland 200th Anniversary Conference, Helsinki, Finland\n\nThank you. I usually begin my remarks by stating that my views are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). However, in this case, I would like to extend best wishes to the Bank of Finland on its 200th anniversary not only from myself but also on behalf of Chairman Bernanke, of the rest of the FOMC, and of the entire Federal Reserve System. All of us have enjoyed many years of fruitful contact with the Bank of Finland, and we hope to continue to do so for many more to come. Okay, disclaimer back on. 1\n\nThe subject of this session, \"Finance and Growth,\" is aptly chosen, as the severity of the recent global financial crisis has prompted a reappraisal of conventional thinking regarding the role of the financial system in our economies. Because one of the distinguishing features of the crisis was its global reach, this reappraisal should address, among other issues, the benefits of global capital mobility and the extent to which countries should open their financial markets to the rest of the world. Does increased financial openness result in stronger economic growth and improved economic performance more generally? Indeed, even well before the current crisis, a number of economists had begun to question the near-consensus view in favor of unrestricted financial openness. And, more recently, a number of publications from economists at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have suggested circumstances when capital controls might be appropriate. 2 As a practical matter, during the ongoing recovery from the crisis, some emerging market economies have attracted considerable capital inflows, raising concerns about potential overheating and leading authorities in a number of countries to impose capital controls in an attempt to manage these flows.\n\nAs I will discuss today, these issues are complicated, but I continue to believe that open capital markets offer significant benefits in terms of greater efficiency and improved standards of living, and that they represent a long-run goal to which policymakers should remain committed. That said, recent experience suggests that reaping the full benefits of capital mobility requires prerequisites, including a sound legal and institutional infrastructure, solid prudential supervision and regulation, and appropriate incentives for risk management by domestic financial institutions. Suffice it to say that the achievement of these objectives takes time. In the interim, countries may need to employ a variety of tools to effectively manage capital flows. Such tools may include macroeconomic policies, exchange rate flexibility, liberalization of capital outflows, and, perhaps in some particularly challenging instances, constraints on capital inflows. Nevertheless, while successfully managing sizable capital inflows may require a range of policy responses, the need to make these responses is not cause to abandon the pursuit of financial openness as an objective over the longer term.\n\nThe Case for Financial Openness To start off, the arguments in favor of countries being open to financial flows are compelling. First, countries that open their markets to capital flows can be expected to reap stronger economic growth. Indeed, the economic history of a number of small, open advanced economies, such as Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, points to a notable role for foreign capital, especially from the United Kingdom and the United States. 3 And the United States was itself aided by foreign capital at an early stage of its development. 4 That the advanced economies have achieved high standards of living, while at the same time embracing financial openness, suggests that such openness is likely to bring long-term benefits for other countries as well.\n\nFree capital markets support economic growth by allowing resources to move across borders to their most productive uses. These flows should expand the opportunities for savers and, in the savings-rich countries, likely raise the return on domestic savings. Capital inflows can lower the cost of capital to firms in capital-scarce countries, raising investment. The result is more investment, more productive investment, and faster economic growth than would have occurred in the absence of such capital flows. And these flows do not merely represent the wherewithal to finance investments--they potentially are accompanied by positive spillovers from technological transfer and the adoption of managerial and organizational best practices.\n\nSecond, opening up domestic financial markets to the rest of the world subjects domestic financial institutions to foreign competition. Increased competition should make domestic financial institutions more efficient as well as more transparent and better governed. Financial openness may also provide impetus for institutional reform within countries. Such reforms might include a better legal system to enforce contracts and other property rights, better accounting and disclosure standards as domestic firms compete for foreign funds, and improved prudential supervision as domestic regulators observe the risk-management practices of foreign financial institutions. In addition, some observers argue that greater financial openness may even yield better macroeconomic policy, as countries are subject to the discipline of outside capital markets.\n\nThird, being more open to the rest of the world--both to financial flows and to trade--may help countries better absorb economic shocks by allowing temporary current account surpluses and deficits. For example, a spending boom that leads the economy to overheat could induce a rise in the country's currency and a decline in exports, restoring more normal conditions and avoiding an undesirable rise in inflation. Any impediments to the free operation of international capital markets, including their role in setting exchange rates, can hamper this rebalancing of demand across countries.\n\nFinally, openness also improves welfare by allowing countries greater scope to share risk. Although financial openness may or may not reduce the volatility of an economy's output, risk-averse consumers should benefit by diversifying their portfolios across countries and thus insuring themselves against the shocks hitting their own particular economy. During domestic recessions, lower income from domestic assets may be offset by higher income from abroad, thereby reducing consumption volatility, as long as the shocks hitting the domestic and foreign economies are not too similar.\n\nSome Practical Challenges Despite the strong case for financial openness, countries have faced some practical challenges in the pursuit of this objective. In particular, capital flows can be volatile, and many countries have struggled with the adverse effects of this volatility on the domestic economy. Access to foreign capital may also exacerbate domestic financial distortions, such as maturity mismatches or agency problems, by channeling funds into the domestic system that would not have otherwise been available. A related matter is that the domestic financial system may simply not have the capacity to effectively intermediate large volumes of inflows. For example, if financial supervision is not sufficient to ward off such problems, short-term lending from abroad (so-called hot money) can result in maturity mismatches, which can bankrupt domestic institutions in the event of sharp and sudden outflows. Unhedged borrowing in foreign currencies creates an additional mismatch, where a sharp currency depreciation can dramatically boost debt burdens, push borrowers into insolvency, and, in a vicious circle, induce further curtailment of finance from abroad. Heavily managed exchange rate regimes may also provide incentives for such mismatches to arise. In addition, increased financial openness may increase countries' exposure to the risk of contagion and spillovers from financial shocks elsewhere in the global economy.\n\nMany of these vulnerabilities have been manifest in the emerging market crises of the past several decades. For example, in the lead-up to the 1997-98 Asian crisis, domestic financial intermediation failed to prudently allocate capital, and these deficiencies were amplified by large amounts of external borrowing in foreign currencies, encouraged by heavily managed exchange rate regimes. As such deficiencies came to light, exchange rates collapsed, resulting in large balance sheet losses. Foreign investors lost confidence in much of the region, precipitating capital flight, the spread of the crisis to additional countries, and a sharp downturn in activity in these economies.\n\nConsistent with the broad set of practical challenges posed by capital flows that I have just highlighted, the empirical literature on the connection between openness and growth contains a wide range of findings. For example, work using firm-level data finds notable positive effects, while other papers that draw on cross-country data find little or no effect. 5 In addition, there is limited evidence of any decline in consumption volatility due to increased financial openness. More generally, capital has been observed to flow from capital-poor emerging market economies to capital-rich advanced economies over the past decade, a finding that appears to undermine one of the central rationales for free capital mobility.\n\nThese empirical results notwithstanding, it may be that benefits exist but are difficult to identify in empirical research due to methodological difficulties in measuring financial openness, issues of endogeneity, and the coincidence of greater openness with other types of reform. But the failure of the empirical literature to identify clear gains from financial openness likely also reflects that countries have struggled to effectively manage sizable flows of capital.\n\nNotably, a separate literature that considers the link between domestic financial development and growth finds somewhat stronger evidence for such a relationship. 6 This research finds that countries with stronger domestic financial systems grow faster, partly because firms are better able to access financing from sources besides their own retained earnings. 7 This finding suggests that the benefits of greater financial openness among countries may be larger than has been identified to date.\n\nManaging Capital Inflows Despite the practical challenges associated with managing capital inflows, we should be careful not to conclude that limiting capital mobility is a first-best policy outcome. The recent financial crisis certainly highlighted the fact that financial markets are prone to speculative excesses and behavior that may exacerbate systemic risk. But, as central bankers and supervisors, we must remain humble about our ability to preempt market forces in ways that predictably enhance welfare.\n\nAn alternative to limiting capital mobility is for countries to rely on more-standard policy tools as an initial line of defense against the challenges posed by capital flows. For example, the effects of undesired capital movements prompted by variations in the business cycle can be addressed directly with the mix of fiscal and monetary policies. Countries facing overheating, with strong capital flows being attracted by rising interest rates, may consider a tighter fiscal policy to reduce both the extent of overheating and the related strength of capital inflows. And some countries facing strong capital inflows may help alleviate pressures by lifting controls on capital outflows. Exchange rate flexibility can also play a crucial role in helping modulate the effects of capital flows, as exchange rates appreciate in response to an inflow (or depreciate in the face of outflows), thereby contributing to external balance and damping further such flows by altering asset valuations. Increased exchange rate flexibility should also discourage excessive currency mismatches, as market participants better gauge the risks of future currency movements. Notably, in some cases, volatile capital flows have been a symptom of deeper distortions within the recipient country, and addressing these distortions has required a shift in the underlying mix of the country's policies.\n\nPast experience also highlights that attempts to limit financial openness are themselves imperfect. Clearly, capital controls can influence capital flows if applied with enough force. But how effective are they and at what cost? The Chilean controls on capital inflows during the 1990s are often cited as an example of an approach that other countries might use. But studies of these controls, including by staff members at the Central Bank of Chile itself, suggest that the success of the Chilean controls was mixed. The controls did shift the composition of flows away from assets with shorter maturities, but the effects on the volume of flows and the exchange rate--two key goals of the controls--are less clear. 8 Some evidence also suggests that the controls harmed small firms in Chile by reducing the availability of financing and raising interest rates. 9\n\nIn addition, the incentives to circumvent capital controls are powerful when the returns that these flows might reap are large. In the extreme, controls can lead to rent-seeking behavior or, worse, result in corruption among public officials. 10 Controls can also result in unintended distortions in prices in other financial markets or in goods prices as investors use those markets to try to move funds into or out of a country. Moreover, global capital flows have increased dramatically in recent decades. Although these substantial flows are the very reason that many countries wish to impose capital controls, the size of the flows--as well as the sophistication of investors who might seek to circumvent controls--means that countries that avoid opening up may face higher and higher costs in trying to control them.\n\nFinally, capital controls have global implications, as restricting financial openness can impede current account adjustment and thus hinder the world economy from reaching a more balanced equilibrium. Indeed, as I have noted in an earlier speech, the current international monetary system is a mixture of economies, some with open capital accounts and flexible exchange rates, and others with managed exchange rates, more-restricted capital mobility, and more-limited monetary policy independence. Many of these latter economies also have current account surpluses, in part because authorities have been able to resist currency appreciation, and thus inhibit external adjustment, for prolonged periods. This feature of the international system inhibits the process of global rebalancing and could restrain the current recovery.\n\nThus, at most, capital controls should be seen as just one of many tools that can be used to manage capital inflows, and one to be used only in particularly challenging situations. The IMF work that I mentioned earlier concludes that capital controls may be appropriate in conjunction with other policy tools as long as countries meet certain conditions. Foreign currency reserves should already be adequate, and exchange rates should not be undervalued. Controls should not be used as a substitute for necessary macroeconomic policy adjustments; for example, if the economy is overheating, controls should only be used along with a suitable monetary-fiscal policy mix. Moreover, controls should be lifted once these prerequisites no longer apply. 11\n\nIn addition, the IMF's work encourages countries to turn to macroprudential tools before making use of capital controls. Although admittedly no bright line differentiates these two types of policies, macroprudential tools generally are designed to enhance the resilience of the financial system, a broader and more enduring objective than directly managing capital flows. Operationally, macroprudential tools typically do not discriminate between residents and nonresidents, nor differentiate by currency. Examples of such prudential policies would include guidance on loan-to-value ratios, capital adequacy standards, and limits on net open foreign exchange positions. 12\n\nReaping the Full Benefits of Financial Openness So where do we go from here? What needs to be done for countries to reap the full benefits of financial openness? In my view, all countries must continue working toward improving the resilience of their domestic financial systems to better take advantage of the potential gains from free international financial flows. Policymakers should strive to mitigate financial distortions by improving the regulation and supervision of financial markets and institutions, encouraging market transparency, and setting rules to enhance corporate governance. Effective microprudential policy frameworks should promote robust domestic financial institutions that are able to suitably intermediate both domestic and foreign capital. Prudential regulation should also be alert for risks from abroad, such as a buildup of liquidity risk, foreign currency exposure, or, more generally, inadequate intermediation of foreign credit. Indeed, some empirical studies find greater benefits from financial openness when domestic financial markets are more developed and where institutions and markets are well supervised. 13\n\nGranted, setting up an adequate financial policy framework takes significant time and resources. Moreover, putting such a framework in place before liberalizing capital flows is not a guarantee that countries will capture the full gains to financial openness without any attendant stresses. Indeed, the recent crisis highlights that these efforts are ongoing for all countries, including the United States. However, though effective regulation and supervision are not a panacea, they doubtless increase the chance that economies will benefit from financial innovation and openness.\n\nThe United States has taken an important step toward strengthening the institutional underpinnings of its financial system with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The act will improve the monitoring of systemic risks, strengthen the supervision of systemically important institutions, support an effective resolution mechanism for large institutions, bring greater transparency to derivatives markets, and improve the effectiveness of consumer financial protection regulation. The act gives the Federal Reserve some new responsibilities. Among them are participating in the new Financial Stability Oversight Council and developing enhanced prudential standards for systemic nonbank financial firms and bank holding companies. We are working diligently to meet our new responsibilities and to enhance our monitoring of emerging risks to the financial system.\n\nBeyond strengthening our domestic prudential framework, we need to make further progress in international cooperation on improving financial regulation and the international monetary system. Central banks and regulatory agencies are working to design and implement a stronger set of prudential requirements for large, internationally active banking firms. Last year's agreement on the framework for Basel III was an important step, and the Federal Reserve is committed to its timely adoption. Its requirements for more and higher-quality capital and more-stringent liquidity buffers should increase the stability of the financial system and reduce the probability of future crises. In addition, we need to continue to make progress in setting rigorous international standards, clarifying the responsibilities of national regulators of internationally diverse financial institutions, and preventing regulatory arbitrage. We also need to continue to work toward an international monetary system characterized by more-flexible exchange rates and independent monetary policies.\n\nThe case for increased financial openness is complicated, and one where many of us have seen our views evolve. As I have already noted, the challenges to opening domestic financial systems to international capital flows are real, and getting the appropriate policy frameworks in place to permit the successful intermediation of these flows, while crucially important, is likely to take time. But while we should be pragmatic about the tools we use to manage capital flows, we should also keep in mind the long-term benefits that financial openness promises.\n\nReferences\n\nArcand, Jean-Louis, Enrico Berkes, and Ugo Panizza (2011). \" Too Much Finance? \" unpublished paper, available at No Original Content (blog), March.\n\nBordo, Michael D., Barry Eichengreen, and Douglas A.

    "text": "October 21, 2011\n\nVice Chair Janet L. Yellen\n\nAt the 2011 Annual Meeting of the Financial Management Association International, Denver, Colorado\n\nFor more than 40 years, the Financial Management Association International has promoted the advancement of knowledge about financial decisionmaking and its dissemination to practitioners worldwide. The association's efforts benefit not only private-sector participants in financial markets, but also policymakers in central banks and governments who strive to ensure that the financial system works effectively to support global economic growth. As one of the many beneficiaries of the association's work, I am honored to receive this year's Outstanding Financial Executive Award.\n\nMy comments today will focus on recent economic and financial market developments, along with their implications for the outlook and for economic policy. I will begin by pointing out that, although the U.S. economy continues to grow, the recovery has been proceeding at a disappointingly slow pace. Moreover, slow growth leaves the economy vulnerable to downside shocks, such as the potential for adverse developments in global financial markets. I then will discuss ways that monetary policy and fiscal policy can support the economic recovery and address these risks to the expansion. Let me note at the outset that these remarks reflect my own views and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe U.S. Economic Outlook Since the middle of 2009, the U.S. economy has been recovering from the most severe recession and financial crisis to afflict our country since the Great Depression. Certainly, conditions have improved in a number of ways during these past two years: Output growth has resumed, and private-sector employment has risen about 2-1/2 million since payrolls troughed in early 2010. Industrial production has generally advanced solidly, business investment in equipment and software continues to rise briskly, and U.S. exports have grown at a robust pace. In addition, financial market functioning is much better than in the depths of the crisis; the quantity and quality of capital and the size of liquidity buffers in the banking system have improved significantly; nonfinancial business balance sheets are mostly in solid shape; and credit conditions, although still tight, have eased somewhat for many businesses and households.\n\nDespite these improvements, the pace of the economic recovery has been less vigorous than any of us would have desired and than most forecasters had anticipated. Indeed, recent revisions of economic data by the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis indicate that the recession was deeper, and the recovery weaker, than previously estimated. Since the beginning of the recovery in the third quarter of 2009 through the second quarter of this year, the most recent quarter for which an estimate is available, real gross domestic product (GDP) expanded at an average annual rate of about 2-1/2 percent, a slower pace than during the first two years of most U.S. recoveries in the past half-century. As a consequence, aggregate output in the second quarter still had not reached its peak level just prior to the recession. Not surprisingly, the unemployment rate has declined only 1 percentage point from its high of about 10 percent near the end of 2009, and the number of jobs in the private sector remains more than 6 million below the peak level reached in early 2008. The fraction of those now jobless who have been without work for six months or more stands at a very high level. And, in addition to those officially unemployed, many individuals are involuntarily working part time or have dropped out of the labor force entirely.\n\nU.S. economic growth was particularly anemic in the first half of this year, when real GDP rose at an average annual rate of less than 1 percent. Two factors, both largely transitory, played a notable role in depressing growth and in boosting inflation during the first half of the year. First, sharp increases in the prices of oil and other commodities eroded the purchasing power of households' incomes, thus restraining their spending. Gasoline and food prices surged, and a portion of producers' higher input costs were passed through to the prices of a wide range of consumer goods and services. Second, the production and sale of motor vehicles declined sharply because of disruptions in global supply chains in the aftermath of the disastrous earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan last March. These supply disruptions also limited the availability of some popular models, placing upward pressure on motor vehicle prices.\n\nFortunately, commodity prices have come down from their earlier peaks, which should ease pressures on consumer prices and, in turn, lessen strains on household budgets. Automotive supply chain disruptions have also diminished in recent months, resulting in a rebound of both the production and sales of new motor vehicles. Partly for these reasons, it looks likely that economic growth in the second half of this year will be noticeably stronger, and inflation more moderate, than in the first half. Unfortunately, however, a range of other, more persistent factors also appear to be restraining the recovery. Moreover, financial market conditions have deteriorated, on net, in recent months, intensifying some of the headwinds facing the economy.\n\nPersistent Restraints on the Economic Recovery The average pace of consumer spending during the past several quarters has been weaker than can be explained by the transitory factors that I just mentioned. High levels of unemployment and underemployment, slow gains in wages, and declines in the values of both homes and financial assets have weighed on household spending. Households appear to have made some progress in deleveraging, but many still face elevated debt burdens and reduced access to credit. Moreover, consumer sentiment dropped markedly over the summer and has remained low since then, reflecting households' concerns about the broader economy as well as their own financial situations.\n\nWeak consumer spending, unsurprisingly, increases concerns among businesses about the prospects for sustained growth in the demand for their products and services. As a consequence, many businesses have been reluctant to significantly expand their payrolls. Indeed, the average pace of hiring during the past several months has been quite a bit slower than earlier in the year. As a result, the unemployment rate has continued to hover in the vicinity of 9 percent since early this year. Furthermore, recent surveys have shown some deterioration in firms' hiring plans, and new claims for unemployment insurance by workers who have been laid off remain relatively high. Such indicators are consistent with job gains remaining tepid in the coming months.\n\nA sharp downturn in housing was at the core of the recent recession, and this sector continues to weigh on the recovery. Robust increases in housing activity have helped spur recoveries from most U.S. recessions in the past 50 years. This time, in contrast, residential construction remains depressed by a large inventory of foreclosed and distressed properties, tight credit conditions for construction loans and mortgages, concerns about further declines in home prices, and the substantial number of homeowners whose mortgage balances exceed the values of their homes. As a result, new home construction currently is at only about one-third of its average pace in recent decades.\n\nIn the government sector, with ongoing pressures on their budgets, state and local governments have continued to shrink their payrolls and reduce their spending on construction projects. Moreover, the boost to the economy from earlier stimulus policies by the federal government has begun to wind down, and, absent further actions by the Congress and the Administration, federal fiscal policy will also restrain the pace of the recovery in the year ahead. Of course, it is unclear how the future path for fiscal policy will evolve--a topic I will return to later--and the uncertainty surrounding both the federal budget process and the future course of fiscal policy appears to have weighed on household and business confidence of late.\n\nI noted earlier that the recovery has benefited from rising exports, largely reflecting strong foreign economic growth. But since the spring, the pace of underlying economic growth in many foreign economies has slowed. Economic activity has decelerated particularly sharply in Europe because of the intensification of fiscal and financial stress in the euro area. The substantial reductions in government spending and increases in taxes that some countries have had to put in place to address their fiscal problems also have weighed on the pace of economic activity in the region. In addition, economic growth in many emerging market economies also looks to be moderating. Over the past two years, emerging market economies generally have been expanding at a faster rate than the more advanced economies, which has helped boost the overall pace of the global recovery. The recent step-down in the rate of expansion in many of these economies likely reflects less demand for their exports from Europe and the United States.\n\nFinancial Markets and Institutions Turning to financial markets, I noted that conditions have improved since the depths of the crisis, but obvious strains remain, some of which have intensified in recent months. Since the early summer, financial markets have been experiencing an unusual amount of volatility, and investors have pulled back from risky assets on balance. The result has been lower equity prices, wider risk spreads on corporate bonds and many other debt instruments, and greater pressures on financial institutions.  At the same time, heightened demand for safe assets has put downward pressure on Treasury yields and boosted the foreign exchange value of the dollar. These developments partly reflect the response by investors to news about the U.S. outlook that has, on net, fallen short of their expectations, as well as a recognition that growth is slowing elsewhere in the global economy. But they also reflect anxiety in financial markets about the fiscal problems in Greece and other euro-zone countries, along with greater sensitivity to the exposures of the European banking system to troubled sovereign debt. European leaders are strongly committed to addressing these issues and have begun to make some progress on them, but the need to obtain agreement among a large number of euro-zone countries to be able to put in place necessary backstops, as well as difficulties involved in addressing the fiscal imbalances in some of these countries, has slowed the process of developing and implementing solutions. At this time, it is difficult to know just how much these developments in global financial markets have affected U.S. economic activity thus far. But, looking forward, particularly worrisome is the possibility that U.S. financial institutions facing earnings or funding pressures, in part as a result of the problems in Europe, could cut back on lending, tighten credit terms, or attempt to delever by rapidly selling off assets. Indeed, recent surveys suggest that the trend we had been seeing of increased availability of credit and easing of terms among dealers may have been interrupted. A significant deterioration of the U.S. economic outlook, of course, would place financial institutions under additional stress. The potential for such adverse financial developments to derail the recovery creates, in my view, significant downside risks to the outlook.\n\nInflation Before turning to economic policy, let me briefly discuss the outlook for inflation. Inflation picked up significantly over the first half of this year, with the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rising at an annual rate of about 3-1/2 percent--a pace that is well above the level of 2 percent or a little less that most Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants consider consistent with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate for price stability and maximum employment. In contrast, PCE inflation averaged less than 1-1/2 percent over the preceding two years. As I noted at the outset, the recent surge in inflation, in my view, reflected to a substantial degree the sharp increases earlier this year in the prices of oil and other commodities and the effect of the Japanese tragedy on auto production and prices. In the statement following our most recent meeting in September, the FOMC indicated that it anticipates that inflation will moderate over coming quarters, settling at levels at or below those consistent with our dual mandate as the effects of these supply-side shocks on prices continue to wane. Importantly, I see little indication that the higher rate of inflation experienced so far this year has become ingrained in the economy. Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable according to surveys, and market-based measures of inflation compensation are still subdued; measures derived from yields of Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) suggest that expected inflation over the next five years currently is around 1-3/4 percent. The substantial amount of resource slack that is projected to remain in U.S. labor and product markets over the next several years, coupled with sustained growth in productivity, should continue to restrain the growth in labor costs, helping to contain inflationary pressures. In fact, there is a risk that disinflationary pressures could intensify if the recovery faltered. Indeed, based on imputations from TIPS prices, market participants' assessments of the odds of outright deflation have risen significantly in recent months.\n\nMonetary Policy Since the onset of the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has employed a wide array of policy tools to foster our statutory objectives of maximum employment and price stability. In particular, with conventional policy having pushed short-term nominal interest rates close to zero, the FOMC--like a number of other major central banks around the world--has provided additional monetary accommodation by modifying our forward policy guidance and by adjusting our securities holdings.\n\nForward Policy Guidance The conventional tool of U.S. monetary policy is to make adjustments to the target for the federal funds rate. That target, which stood at 5-1/4 percent as of mid-2007, was subsequently brought down to a range of 0 to 1/4 percent, and the effective federal funds rate has been maintained in that range since December 2008. Since that time, the FOMC has provided forward guidance about the anticipated future path of the federal funds rate. For example, in each meeting statement from March 2009 through June 2011, the Committee indicated our expectation that economic conditions \"are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period.\" 1 At our August meeting, the Committee decided to provide more-specific information about the likely time horizon by substituting the phrase \"at least through mid-2013\" for the phrase \"for an extended period.\" 2 This clarification appears to have reduced market uncertainty about the Committee's current policy expectations.\n\nThe Committee's guidance refers to a specific calendar date, which could be periodically revised by the Committee if appropriate. However, it is explicitly framed as contingent on economic conditions, including \"low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run.\" 3 Importantly, it is not stated as an unconditional commitment to a specific course for the federal funds rate. Market participants are naturally interested in gaining greater insight into how shifts in the economic outlook would affect the likely timing and pace of policy firming. As noted in the minutes of the August and September FOMC meetings, the Committee has discussed possible approaches to enhance its forward guidance along these lines--that is, to provide greater insight concerning its \"reaction function.\" 4\n\nOne potentially promising way to clarify the dependence of policy on economic conditions would be for the FOMC to frame the forward guidance in terms of specific numerical thresholds for unemployment and inflation. Such an approach was discussed by my colleague Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, in a recent speech. 5 Evans suggested that the FOMC could indicate its intention to continue holding the federal funds rate close to zero as long as the unemployment rate exceeds a given threshold, conditional on the medium-term inflation outlook remaining at or below a specified level. 6 Such an approach could be helpful in facilitating public understanding of how various possible shifts in the economic outlook would be likely to affect the anticipated timing of policy firming. For example, if there were a further downward revision of the economic outlook, investors would recognize that the conditions for policy firming would not be reached until a later date and hence would have a more concrete basis for extending the time period during which they expect the federal funds rate to remain near zero.\n\nThe approach of numerically specifying the values of unemployment and inflation that could prompt policy tightening is not without potential pitfalls, however. For example, such thresholds could potentially be misunderstood as conveying the Committee's longer-run objectives rather than the conditions surrounding the likely onset of policy firming. Thus, in addition to giving careful consideration to this particular approach, it seems sensible to explore other potential enhancements to FOMC communications--a topic to which I will return shortly.\n\nSecurities Holdings by the Federal Reserve The FOMC has also provided monetary accommodation by modifying the size and composition of the Federal Reserve's securities holdings. In particular, during 2009 and early 2010, the Federal Reserve purchased about $1.4 trillion in agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and agency debt securities and about $300 billion in longer-term Treasury securities. Last November, the Committee initiated an additional $600 billion in purchases of longer-term Treasury securities, and those transactions were completed at the end of June.\n\nAt our recent September meeting, the FOMC announced that we intend to extend the average maturity of our securities holdings over coming months by selling $400 billion of short-term Treasury securities and purchasing an equivalent amount of long-term Treasury securities. This maturity extension program should exert downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and help make broader financial conditions more accommodative, thereby supporting a stronger economic recovery. At that meeting, we also decided that the principal payments from our holdings of agency securities will now be reinvested in agency MBS rather than in Treasury securities; this step was taken to support mortgage markets.\n\nBoth of these decisions will affect the composition of our securities holdings without affecting the overall size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet or the level of reserve balances of depository institutions. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that the scale of the maturity extension program is necessarily limited by the amount of our holdings of shorter-term securities; furthermore, purchasing a very large proportion of the outstanding stock of longer-term Treasury securities could potentially have adverse effects on market functioning. Thus, securities purchases across a wide spectrum of maturities might become appropriate if evolving economic conditions called for significantly greater monetary accommodation.\n\nMonetary Policy Communications In recent years the FOMC has taken a number of significant steps to enhance the clarity of our communications about our longer-run objectives, our medium-term outlook, and our policy strategy. Transparency is an essential aspect of conducting monetary policy in a democratic society: The central bank is accountable to the public and hence needs to strive to explain its decisions as clearly as possible. Indeed, I believe that the Federal Reserve qualifies as one of the most transparent central banks in the world.\n\nMoreover, clear communications play an integral role in facilitating the effectiveness of monetary policy actions. Expectations play a critical role in the decisions of forward-looking households and businesses about how much to spend, work, hire, and invest, and their decisions are more likely to be consistent with the objectives of the central bank if they are based on a solid understanding of the shocks affecting the economy and the likely monetary policy response. When financial market participants understand how a central bank is likely to react to incoming information, asset prices should adjust in ways that anticipate the central bank's expected policy actions, enhancing the monetary policy transmission mechanism and thereby supporting the central bank's attainment of its objectives. Finally, good communication can help anchor the public's long-term inflation expectations, which can, in turn, greatly improve the scope for monetary policy to counteract departures of resource utilization from its sustainable level.\n\nFour times a year the FOMC publishes the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which conveys information about Committee participants' economic outlook for the next several calendar years and over the longer run. The SEP includes projections of real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, the PCE inflation rate, and the \"core\" inflation rate for PCE excluding food and energy. Since last spring, the Chairman has been conducting a news conference in conjunction with each release of the projections to help explain the FOMC's policy decisions in the context of our economic outlook.\n\nThe longer-run projections in the SEP convey Committee participants' individual assessments of the rates of economic growth, unemployment, and inflation to which the economy would be expected to converge under appropriate policy and in the absence of further shocks. The longer-run inflation projections indicate that most Committee participants judge inflation of 2 percent or a bit less to be most consistent with our statutory mandate. In the latest projections, participants' estimates for the longer-run normal rate of unemployment had a range of 5 to 6 percent--well below the current unemployment rate of 9.1 percent and hence underscoring the degree to which the economy remains quite far from its balanced-growth path.\n\nOf course, there is always room for further improvement, and therefore the Committee continues to explore ways of enhancing the clarity of our communications. For example, as noted in the minutes of our September meeting, we have been discussing potential approaches for providing more information--perhaps through the SEP--regarding our longer-run objectives, the factors that influence our policy decisions, and our views on the likely evolution of monetary policy. 7\n\nFiscal Policy Turning now to fiscal policy, since the onset of the recent recession and financial crisis, the federal budget deficit has widened significantly. As a result, federal debt held by the public has increased relative to our national income to a level not seen in the past half-century. These budget developments have reflected both the weak economy, which has depressed revenues and pushed up expenditures, and the fiscal stimulus that was implemented to help ease the recession and support the recovery. So long as the economy continues to recover, the deficit should narrow over the next several years as a growing economy boosts revenues and reduces expenditures and as the policies put in place to provide economic stimulus continue to wind down. Even so, the federal budget is on an unsustainable path over the longer run, in large part because of the aging of the U.S. population and fast-rising health-care costs. If current policy settings are maintained, the ratio of federal debt held by the public to national income would continue to rise in coming decades.\n\nIt is crucial that the federal budget be put on a sustainable long-run trajectory, and we should not postpone charting that course. A failure to put in place a credible plan to address our long-run budget imbalance would expose the United States to serious economic costs and risks in the long term and possibly sooner. Timely enactment of a plan to eliminate future unsustainable budget gaps will make it easier for individuals and businesses to prepare for and adjust to the changes. In addition, the sooner our longer-term budget problems are addressed, the less wrenching the adjustment will have to be and the more control that policymakers--rather than market forces or international creditors--will have over the timing, size, and composition of the necessary adjustments.\n\nAt the same time, it is important to recognize that too much fiscal tightening in the near term could harm the economic recovery. Significant near-term reductions in federal spending or large increases in taxes would impose an additional drag on the economy at a time when aggregate demand is already weak. We need, and I believe we have scope for, an approach to fiscal policy that puts in place a well-timed and credible plan to bring deficits down to sustainable levels over the medium and long terms while also addressing the economy's short-term needs. I do not underestimate the difficulty of crafting a strategy for our fiscal policy that appropriately balances short-run needs with long-run considerations, but doing so would provide important benefits to the U.S. economy.\n\nConclusion In summary, the Federal Reserve has taken forceful actions to promote its objectives of maximum employment and stable prices, and we strive to communicate as clearly as possible our longer-run objectives as well as our medium-term outlook and policy strategy. Although U.S. economic growth was particularly slow during the first half of this year, I expect that the pace of recovery will pick up over coming quarters and that unemployment will resume a gradual decline toward its longer-run sustainable rate; moreover, I anticipate that the medium-term outlook for inflation will remain subdued. Nonetheless, there are significant downside risks. Therefore, the FOMC will continue to assess the economic outlook in light of incoming information, and we are prepared to employ our tools as appropriate to foster a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability.\n\n1.

    "text": "March 04, 2011\n\nVice Chair Janet L. Yellen\n\nAt the Banque de France International Symposium, Paris, France\n\nNearly four decades have elapsed since the demise of Bretton Woods, and during that time, the international monetary and financial system has undergone a significant transformation. The changes that have occurred reflect deliberate policy choices by the official sector as well as the organic interactions of investors, institutions, and advancing technologies. Judging by the standards of global economic growth, stable prices, and financial stability, the international monetary and financial system, in its current incarnation, has a decidedly mixed record. Wrenching crises and economic distress, notably including the difficult experience of the past several years, have punctuated periods of solid growth, low inflation, and financial stability. Thus, the subject of today's discussion is vitally important, and I am pleased to contribute my thoughts on steps we can take to improve our international economic order. 1\n\nIn evaluating our policy priorities, I find it helpful to distinguish between the international monetary system and the international financial system. 2 The international monetary system is the set of rules, conventions, and institutions associated with monetary policy, official capital flows, and exchange rates. It also includes mechanisms to provide official sector support to countries facing funding pressures. The international financial system is much broader, encompassing both private and official participants in global financial markets. I consider this distinction important in thinking about how to reduce the incidence and severity of future crises while preserving a prosperous global economy.\n\nIn the case of the recent global financial crisis and recession, I would apportion responsibility to inadequacies in both the monetary and financial systems. With respect to the international monetary system, the basic story is now quite familiar: Strong capital outflows from countries with chronic current account surpluses--in part reflecting heavily managed exchange rates, reserve accumulation, and other shortcomings in the operation of the international monetary system--put downward pressure on real interest rates, in turn boosting asset prices (particularly for housing) and enhancing the availability of credit. These developments contributed significantly to the buildup of financial imbalances, but they were not, on their own, sufficient to have engendered the massive financial crisis we experienced.\n\nHad the additional domestic credit associated with these capital inflows been used effectively, the imbalances need not have led to financial ruin. In the United States and other countries with current account deficits, however, borrowing too often supported excessive spending on housing and consumption, rather than financing productive investment. Most important, declines in underwriting standards, breakdowns in lending oversight by investors and rating agencies, increased use of opaque financial products, and more-general inadequacies in risk management by private financial institutions helped foster a dangerous and unsustainable credit boom. With the financial system evolving rapidly, supervisors and regulators, both in the United States and in many other countries, failed to recognize and address the mounting vulnerabilities. In short, these failures rooted in the financial system interacted with weaknesses in the global monetary system to create stresses and instabilities that eventually triggered--and amplified--the recent financial crisis and subsequent recession.\n\nOther economic crises can similarly be traced to the interaction of weaknesses in the global monetary and financial systems. For example, the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s was rooted in failures to prudently allocate capital to productive investments--failures of financial intermediation. But these problems were made worse by characteristics of the international monetary system, as heavily managed exchange rates encouraged excessive foreign currency borrowing. The collapse of the Thai baht in mid-1997, which marked the beginning of the crisis, resulted in substantial balance sheet losses--particularly for that country's banks--and triggered a widespread reappraisal of risk in the entire region. As investors lost confidence, capital fled these economies, precipitating a severe downturn. As in the recent experience of the United States, better management of domestic financial systems in the emerging Asian economies would have greatly limited, if not prevented, the financial vulnerabilities that ultimately resulted in the crisis, but policies regarding exchange rate regimes and capital flows were also an important part of the story.\n\nThe conclusion I draw from these and other financial crises is that we must strengthen both the financial system and the monetary system to create a more stable and less crisis-prone global economy. Improving the international financial system requires better management of national financial sectors and also enhanced international cooperation and coordination, because in a globalized economy with strong, complex, cross-border linkages, even domestic financial stresses can have serious international repercussions.\n\nCountries need to work together to ensure that weaknesses in the global financial system are recognized and addressed. I am encouraged by the progress we have made in strengthening the banking sector through the capital and liquidity requirements of Basel III. We have also made important strides in improving international cooperation and coordination in the supervision of systemically important financial institutions, whose operations and exposures span numerous jurisdictions. That said, we need to continue working toward viable resolution mechanisms for these institutions. Further work is also needed to improve our macroprudential approach to managing vulnerabilities. And we must collaborate to ensure that risky activities do not migrate to the shadows of the financial system in an attempt to circumvent regulatory authorities.\n\nWe must also strengthen the international monetary system. We need a system characterized by more open capital accounts, flexible exchange rates, and independent monetary policies. Open capital accounts, supported by appropriate financial supervision and regulation, channel savings to their most productive uses, thereby enhancing welfare. Exchange rate flexibility improves domestic macroeconomic management, allowing countries to pursue independent monetary policies tailored to their individual needs, and limits unwelcome spillovers to other economies. Such a system can also flexibly adapt to changing economic and financial realities as countries develop, technology progresses, and shocks buffet the global economy.\n\nOur current international monetary system does not yet fulfill these objectives. We now have a hybrid arrangement in which some economies have flexible exchange rates, maintain open capital accounts, and pursue independent monetary policy--a sensible reconciliation of the so-called impossible trinity. But other countries heavily manage their exchange rates, with varying mixes of capital mobility and monetary policy independence.\n\nInflexible exchange rates in these countries have tended to inhibit adjustment of unsustainable global imbalances in trade and capital flows. Indeed, as I noted, such imbalances appear to have fostered the buildup of vulnerabilities in the run-up to the recent financial crisis. Countries with current account surpluses and restricted capital flows have been able to resist currency appreciation for prolonged periods, even when justified by underlying fundamentals. In principle, adjustment of imbalances could occur if countries permitting relatively limited movements in nominal exchange rates allow their national price levels to adjust over time. But sterilization operations and other policy tools can, and often have, restrained such adjustment. Meanwhile, countries with current account deficits should take steps to increase national saving, including by putting in place credible plans to reduce their fiscal deficits in the longer run.\n\nThe international monetary system, in effect, still suffers from the same asymmetry that bedeviled the Bretton Woods system--namely, a marked differential in the pressures facing surplus and deficit countries to permit automatic adjustments or to undertake policy to reduce persistent global imbalances. Surplus countries can resist adjustment by restricting capital flows and exchange rate movements, but deficit countries are forced to adjust when they run out of international reserves or lose access to external borrowing. This asymmetry has served to inhibit the global rebalancing process, and it could threaten the ongoing recovery: If deficit countries curtail spending without offsetting spending increases in the surplus countries, aggregate demand would decline, with adverse consequences for the global economy.\n\nThus, in my view, we need to continue working toward an international monetary system characterized by more-flexible exchange rates, open capital accounts, and independent monetary policies that will facilitate the adjustment of global imbalances. But we must recognize that countries face diverse challenges in such a transition. For countries with undervalued currencies, the adoption of more-flexible exchange rates requires an internal shift in resources across sectors--a transition that takes time. As noted earlier, the recent crisis has also uncovered numerous flaws in the functioning of regulation of our financial system, and these, too, will take time to correct. Finally, although I have not addressed this concern in my remarks today, the expansion of public-sector deficits and debts in many countries poses very serious medium- to long-run risks for both the international monetary and financial systems that will need to be addressed.\n\nAgainst the background of these longer-term issues, we must also support countries' efforts to address their more immediate challenges. Some advanced economies struggle with weak demand, high unemployment, and disinflation. Many emerging market economies face increasing inflationary pressures and capital inflows amid strong growth. In light of these differing challenges, a cooperative spirit among policymakers is essential to ensure prosperity of the global economy.\n\n1.

    "text": "November 29, 2011\n\nVice Chair Janet L. Yellen\n\nAt the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, San Francisco, California\n\nGood morning. I'm delighted to return \"home\" to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and honored to kick off the Bank's second Asia Economic Policy Conference.\n\nIn my remarks this morning I will underscore the urgency of strengthened international policy cooperation to attain strong, sustainable and balanced growth in the global economy--a theme that received emphasis at the Group of Twenty (G-20) Leaders' Summit in Cannes earlier this month. The global economy is facing critical challenges. The recovery in the United States and other advanced economies has been proceeding too slowly to provide jobs for millions of unemployed people. There have also been clear signs of slowing growth in emerging market economies over the past year. In effect, we face a dearth of aggregate demand, not just among the advanced economies, but also for the global economy as a whole. 1\n\nIn ordinary times, policymakers in the advanced countries would address such a demand shortfall with expansionary fiscal and monetary policies. But these are no ordinary times. Central banks in a number of advanced economies, including the United States, have brought short-term interest rates close to zero, so that further monetary accommodation can be provided only through unconventional tools, such as securities purchases and forward policy guidance. Meanwhile, the scope for fiscal stimulus is limited by concerns about sizable budget deficits and longer-term sustainability.\n\nAt the G-20 summit earlier this month in Cannes, the United States and other advanced economies--including France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, and the United Kingdom--agreed to pursue fiscal consolidation plans to place public finances on a sustainable course over the medium term while sustaining the near-term recovery. Indeed, in the current environment of weak demand, near-term fiscal consolidation could threaten the economic recovery, which in turn may undermine the success of the fiscal strategy. In such circumstances, economies with the capacity to stimulate global growthâânamely, countries with large current account surpluses and the potential to expand domestic demand--must take a leading role in adopting policies to rebalance and sustain the global economy. This commitment was made by all of the G-20 leaders, including those from China, Indonesia, South Korea, and other emerging markets.\n\nIn the remainder of my remarks, I will point out some key factors that have been restraining the pace of U.S. economic growth, and I will discuss the need for fiscal adjustments to place our federal budget on a sustainable path over the medium term without impairing the economic recovery. I will then turn to a consideration of the crucial role of the Asian economies in fostering a stronger global recovery. Of course, these remarks solely reflect my own views and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nU.S. Economic Growth Since the middle of 2009, the U.S. economy has been recovering from the most severe recession and financial crisis to afflict our country since the Great Depression. However, the pace of the economic recovery has been less vigorous than desired or expected, and the unemployment rate has declined only about 1 percentage point over the past two years. Indeed, the number of jobs in the private sector remains more than 6 million below the peak level reached in early 2008--a distressing development made all the worse by the fact that new entrants have, of course, continued to come into the labor force in recent years. The fraction of those now jobless who have been without work for six months or more stands at a very high level. In addition to those officially unemployed, many individuals are involuntarily working part time or have dropped out of the labor force entirely.\n\nThe pace of economic growth in the second half of this year has been somewhat faster than in the first half, reflecting in part a reversal of the temporary factors that had weighed on growth earlier in the year. Nonetheless, a range of more-persistent factors also appear to be restraining the recovery. In recognition of these drags, the consensus of professional forecasters in the survey released earlier this month by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia was that unemployment would decline only slightly in the next few years, to an average rate of 8.4 percent in 2013. Moreover, financial market conditions have deteriorated, on net, in recent months, intensifying some of the headwinds facing the economy.\n\nAt the onset of the financial crisis, consumer spending contracted sharply and the personal saving rate began a steep ascent. Exhibit 1 shows that the saving rate rose from around 2-1/2 percent in 2006 to about 5 percent in the first half of this year. It now appears that consumer spending is advancing at a moderate pace. In the pre-crisis years, consumer spending grew rapidly, providing considerable impetus to the expansion. In contrast, over the next few years, consumer spending seems unlikely to serve as one of the main engines of growth. The ratio of household debt-to-income remains exceptionally high, even though over the past few years it has declined slightly from the post-World War II peak reached prior to the crisis. Although households appear to have made some progress in deleveraging, many still face elevated debt burdens and reduced access to credit. Moreover, high levels of unemployment and underemployment, slow gains in wages, and declines in the values of both homes and financial assets have weighed on household spending and diminished the ability of households to tap home equity in emergencies or for other purposes. Consumer sentiment dropped markedly over the summer and remains quite depressed, apparently reflecting households' concerns about the broader economy as well as their own financial situations.\n\nA sharp downturn in housing was at the core of the previous recession, and this sector continues to weigh on the recovery. Robust increases in housing activity have helped spur recoveries from most U.S. recessions since World War II. This time, in contrast, residential construction remains depressed by a large inventory of foreclosed and distressed properties either currently available for purchase or probably soon to become so, tight credit conditions for construction loans and mortgages, and concerns about the possibility of further declines in home prices. As a result, new home construction currently is at only about one-third of its average pace in recent decades. In addition, homeowners with insufficient equity in their homes have found it difficult to take advantage of today's low interest rates by refinancing their mortgages. Recently announced changes to the federal government's Home Affordable Refinance Program, or HARP, are designed to improve the opportunity for homeowners to refinance and I'm hopeful this program will succeed in reducing household debt service burdens and the flow of foreclosures. More generally, I see a strong case for additional policies to foster more-rapid recovery in the housing sector. Indeed, to provide greater support for mortgage markets, the Federal Reserve recently adjusted its program for reinvesting its securities holdings.\n\nThe Federal Reserve continues to provide highly accommodative monetary conditions to foster a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability. Moreover, the scope remains to provide additional accommodation through enhanced guidance on the path of the federal funds rate or through additional purchases of longer-term financial assets.\n\nChallenges for U.S. Fiscal Policy Turning now to U.S. fiscal policy, with the onset of the recent recession and financial crisis, the federal budget deficit widened significantly and has remained wide. Exhibit 2 shows that, as a result, federal debt held by the public has increased relative to our national income to a level not seen in the past half-century. These budget developments have reflected both the weak economy, which has depressed revenues and pushed up expenditures, and the fiscal stimulus that was implemented to help ease the recession and support the recovery. So long as the economy continues to recover, the deficit should narrow over the next several years as a growing economy boosts revenues and reduces expenditures and as the policies put in place to provide economic stimulus continue to wind down. Even so, the ratio of debt to gross domestic product (GDP) will continue to edge higher over the next decade unless the Congress and the Administration are able to agree on a program of deficit reduction that is more ambitious than the targets incorporated in last summer's Budget Control Act. Looking yet further out, it is apparent that, absent significant policy shifts, budget pressures resulting from the aging of the U.S. population and fast-rising health-care costs will continue to push the federal debt ratio higher in coming decades. The dashed line in exhibit 2 shows the Congressional Budget Office's long-term projection of the debt-to-GDP ratio through 2035 under current policy settings, including the effects of the Budget Control Act.\n\nIt is crucial that the federal budget be put on a sustainable long-run trajectory, and we should not postpone charting that course. A failure to put in place a credible plan to address our long-run budget imbalance would expose the United States to serious economic costs and risks in the long term and possibly sooner. Timely enactment of a plan to put the federal budget onto a sustainable trajectory will make it easier for individuals and businesses to prepare for these adjustments. In addition, the sooner our longer-term budget problems are addressed, the less wrenching the adjustment will have to be and the more control that policymakers--rather than market forces or international creditors--will have over the timing, size, and composition of the necessary adjustments.\n\nAt the same time, too much fiscal tightening in the near term could harm the economic recovery. Significant near-term reductions in federal spending or large increases in taxes would impose an additional drag on the economy at a time when aggregate demand is already weak. Indeed, under current law, federal fiscal policy is slated to impose considerable restraint on the growth of aggregate demand next year. We need, and I believe we have scope for, an approach to fiscal policy that puts in place a well-timed and credible plan to bring deficits down to sustainable levels over the medium and long terms while also addressing the economy's short-term needs. I do not underestimate the difficulty of crafting a strategy that appropriately balances short-run needs with long-run considerations, but doing so would provide important benefits to the U.S. economy.\n\nThe Key Role of the Emerging Asian Economies In light of the various factors weighing on aggregate demand in the United States and other advanced economies, I believe it is crucial for emerging market economies, particularly in Asia, to take further steps to boost domestic demand, providing support for their own growth and that of the global economy. Indeed, such policies are a core component of the G-20 nations' commitment to strong, sustainable, and balanced growth.\n\nOf course, emerging Asia has already made an important contribution to bolstering the global economy in the wake of the financial crisis. The top panel of exhibit 3 shows that even though the emerging Asian economies were hit quite hard by the global downturn, they recovered much more quickly than did other parts of the world. The full extent of the Asian bounceback can perhaps best be appreciated by comparing the level of output in Asia, shown in the bottom panel of the exhibit, with those in advanced economies and other emerging market economies. Asia's output level--the solid line--has increased substantially from its barely perceptible trough. Output in other emerging market economies--the dashed line--has also increased significantly. In comparison, output in the advanced economies--the dotted line--has not yet attained its pre-crisis peak.\n\nA key factor contributing to the relatively rapid recovery of the Asian emerging market economies was that, in contrast to many previous episodes of severe stress, these economies were well-positioned to permit the use of countercyclical fiscal and monetary policies. Cyclically-adjusted fiscal balances in emerging Asian economies fell noticeably in 2008 and 2009, reflecting a more expansionary fiscal stance; fiscal stimulus was particularly large in China, India, and Singapore. Monetary policy was also eased substantially throughout emerging Asia.\n\nPartly as a result of those policy measures, the growth of the emerging Asian economies over the past several years appears to have relied less on external demand from the advanced economies. The top panel of exhibit 4 shows that the shares of exports in nominal GDP in the Asian economies have trended downwards since 2006 following a decade of solid increases. However, trade balances in the region (shown in the bottom panel of the exhibit) generally remain in surplus, notwithstanding some recent narrowing in several countries. These surpluses suggest that, on balance, the Asian economies continue to add more to global supply than to global demand.\n\nCrucially, private consumption as a share of output still remains quite low in several emerging Asian economies. Exhibit 5 shows that China's consumption share--the solid line--which was already well below that of other major economies in 2000, has fallen steadily over the past decade to about one-third of its GDP. 2 Private consumption shares in other emerging Asian economies--the dashed line--are also significantly below those in the advanced economies--the dotted line--and have not moved up in the wake of the global financial crisis.\n\nMeasures to boost private consumption would appear to benefit not only the global economy, but also the emerging Asian economies themselves. China and other emerging market economies have already taken some steps to promote household consumption, but the progress on this front has been slow and further measures are warranted. Indeed, at the G-20 Cannes summit, China pledged to rebalance its demand toward domestic spending through policies to bolster household income and strengthen social safety nets, and Indonesia and Korea each made similar commitments to facilitate the process of global rebalancing.\n\nWhat are some specific policy measures that could be helpful? First, increased public spending on social services, such as education, health care, and retirement benefits, could spur consumption by reducing the need for precautionary household saving. In China, some redistribution of the profits of state-owned enterprises to the central government through larger dividend payments could provide revenue to support such spending. Second, government support could be shifted away from manufacturing toward encouraging service-sector development, which has typically lagged behind in these economies. Services tend to have a higher non-traded component, so faster growth of this sector would help rebalance growth toward domestic demand. Third, additional development spending could be directed toward these countries' poorest regions; for example, China has recently strengthened its efforts in this area.\n\nThe case for boosting investment rates in Asian emerging economies to support global demand is less clear-cut. At about 45 percent of GDP, Chinese investment rates are now so high that the return on new investment may already be quite low in some sectors. In a number of other countries, however, investment rates are only at about the average of those in the advanced economies. It seems plausible that, with their lower capital-to-labor ratios, investment rates should be higher in some emerging Asian economies. Indeed, some have argued that infrastructure needs remain extremely pronounced in many emerging market economies, and that a wave of investment may be in the offing for the world's developing economies. 3 With low interest rates throughout the world, this would certainly seem to be a propitious time for countries to pursue productive capital investment.\n\nFinally, exchange rate adjustments will play a crucial role in boosting emerging Asia's contribution to global demand. Indeed, the G-20 leaders welcomed China's determination to increase exchange rate flexibility and to carry out its plans to increase convertibility of the renminbi capital account. Such flexibility is crucial if Asian domestic demand is to be expanded without exacerbating inflationary pressures. Exchange rate appreciation channels demand toward foreign products, thereby creating the scope for policies to expand domestic demand without exacerbating inflationary pressures. More generally, exchange rate flexibility makes it easier for monetary policy to respond to domestic considerations and to achieve price stability. Perhaps most important, since the ultimate goal of economic growth is to improve standards of living, allowing the currency to appreciate can help ensure that a greater proportion of output is devoted to household consumption, enabling social welfare to improve at a faster pace.\n\nConclusion To sum up, growth in advanced nations, including the United States, faces serious headwinds. Households are still deleveraging, corporations are reluctant to invest, and fiscal consolidation is needed over time to place public finances on a sustainable course. Despite some pickup in growth in the United States during the second half of the year, the outlook is for unemployment to diminish only slowly, remaining painfully high for many years to come. These developments have also affected emerging market economies, where there are now clear signs of slowing growth. In addition, downside risks to global growth have increased significantly because of rising financial market pressures, reflecting an intensification of stress in European banking and sovereign debt markets as well as broader concerns about the outlook.\n\nThese circumstances call for concerted domestic policy actions to boost growth and create jobs. Indeed, as I already noted, we at the Federal Reserve are moving vigorously to promote a stronger economic recovery. However, monetary policy is not a panacea, and it is essential for other policymakers to also do their part. In particular, there is a strong case for additional measures to address the dysfunctional housing market. Stronger housing demand has the potential to boost recovery. The Congress and the Administration also can support the recovery in the near term while simultaneously putting fiscal policy on a sustainable trajectory in the long term.\n\nAs I have emphasized in this talk, there is also an urgent need for policy action from a number of countries. In Europe, forceful action is essential to address the region's fiscal and financial stresses, which pose a threat not only to growth but also to global financial stability. In addition, many emerging market economies, particularly in Asia, have the scope to bolster domestic demand. Such policies would support stronger, more balanced, and more sustainable global economic growth; they would enhance social welfare at home as well. The most profound effect of the Asian miracle of the past several decades has been to lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. Further actions to boost aggregate demand in Asia will ensure that this miracle is sustained.\n\n1.

    "text": "November 11, 2011\n\nVice Chair Janet L. Yellen\n\nAt the Fourteenth Annual International Banking Conference, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois\n\nLet me begin by thanking the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago for inviting me to participate in this important conference on the role of central banks in financial stability. As you know, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act) assigned the Federal Reserve a central role in the new framework for achieving and maintaining financial stability. I am grateful for this opportunity to explain how we, together with other regulators, have been moving forward to fulfill our new responsibilities. 1\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act instituted substantial changes to financial-sector supervision and regulation in the United States in direct response to the serious deficiencies in the regulatory framework that were revealed, all too painfully, by the financial crisis and the associated deep recession. One key change was the requirement that U.S. financial regulators take a \"macroprudential approach\" to supervision and regulation. In my remarks today, I want to describe how this approach is being put into practice at the Federal Reserve. I will touch on both our own regulatory and supervisory responsibilities and our responsibilities as a member of the multiagency Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), which the Dodd-Frank Act established to promote a more comprehensive approach to monitoring and mitigating systemic risk.\n\nI should note that an important part of putting the macroprudential approach into practice is establishing a new regulatory infrastructure, including the FSOC and its working-committee structure. In addition, individual regulatory agencies have made organizational changes needed to fulfill their new responsibilities. At the Federal Reserve, we have reoriented our supervision of large bank holding companies, and we have created a new office called the Office of Financial Stability Policy and Research, which plays a key role in monitoring financial risks, analyzing the implications for financial stability, and identifying approaches for mitigating identified risks.\n\nOverview of the Macroprudential Approach The explicit incorporation of macroprudential considerations into our structure for financial regulation and oversight represents a major innovation in our thinking about how financial stability is most effectively achieved. In contrast to the traditional, or \"microprudential,\" approach to regulation and supervision, which focuses on the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions, markets, and infrastructures, the macroprudential approach also calls for attention to the financial system as a whole .\n\nIn particular, financial institutions are typically linked together in a complex web of relationships, and hence the sudden failure of a single institution can generate spillover effects on other firms and potentially place the entire financial system at risk. Such externalities are most evident for very large institutions and financial market utilities but may also arise within a set of small or medium-sized firms that are engaged in activities with highly correlated returns. Therefore, the macroprudential approach focuses on achieving financial stability by reducing systemic riskââthat is, the risk of a financial disruption that is severe enough to inflict significant damage on the broader economy. Ideally, this approach is done through preemptive policies that restrain risks to the financial system before they develop into crises.\n\nMacroprudential policies address several forms of systemic risk. One form of risk can be described as structuralââsuch as the presence of systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) or systemically important payment, clearing, or settlement infrastructures or activities, whose failure or financial distress could have outsized destabilizing effects on the rest of the financial system. Another form of risk can be described as cyclical and includes, for example, elevated asset prices and excessive credit growth that arise in robust economic times but can leave the balance sheets of both large and small financial firms vulnerable to downturns in the credit cycle. Attentiveness to these various channels is critical in the monitoring of systemic risk and the formulation of appropriate macroprudential policy responses. In particular, some risks are best allayed by policies that are structural in nature and thus do not change as economic conditions evolve, whereas others are best addressed by policies that are sensitive to economic developments. Indeed, selecting the right policies to address specific forms of systemic risk is important for ensuring that reasonable risk-taking and innovation continue to take place in financial markets so as to foster broader productivity gains, economic growth, and job creation.\n\nA key question for central banks is how macroprudential policies fit together with monetary policy. The evolvingââthough by no means settledââconsensus is that monetary policy is too blunt a tool to be routinely used to address cyclical risks to financial stability, and that more-targeted micro- and macroprudential tools should be used to address these risks. I agree that targeted prudential policies should be the first line of defense against threats to financial stability. However, because their effectiveness in practice is not yet proven, I would not rule out the possibility that monetary policy could be used directly to support financial stability goals, at least on the margin.\n\nIdentifying and Addressing Structural Forms of Systemic Risk I want to turn now to structural sources of systemic risk and discuss how macroprudential policy can be used to mitigate them. Structural vulnerabilities may go largely unnoticed until they are exposed in financial crisesââand at considerable cost. Indeed, many of the regulations now being implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as the international agreements relating to bank capital and liquidity standards, are a reaction to the events of 2007 through 2009. Such responses include regulations and reforms that address risks resulting from the existence of SIFIs and systemically important financial market utilities (FMUs) as well as other efforts to improve the resilience of important financial markets and infrastructure.\n\nBecause the material distress or failure of a SIFI can have outsized effects on the financial sector and the real economy, the Dodd-Frank Act empowers the Federal Reserve to reduce the probability of such events through tougher prudential standards, including enhanced risk-based capital and leverage requirements, liquidity requirements, an early remediation regime, and restrictions on activities. The act also requires the Federal Reserve to consider systemic risk effects when reviewing and ruling on applications for mergers among financial firms. In addition, to ensure that the failure of a SIFI can occur without serious damage to the financial system, the act gives the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation new tools, such as improved resolution planning by firms and an orderly liquidation authority. The act also requires centralized clearing of standardized over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives and introduces margin requirements for noncleared derivatives and other measures to strengthen the integrity and functioning of financial markets.\n\nEfforts to develop these rules have been progressing well. The Federal Reserve will soon release for comment its proposed rule on enhanced prudential standards that would apply to large bank holding companies and systemically important nonbank financial firms. It also recently approved a final rule implementing the resolution plan requirement. Let me note that in these instances, as in all its rulemaking responsibilities, the Federal Reserve is attentive to aligning the rules required by the Dodd-Frank Act with international agreements, such as higher capital standards and new liquidity standards for large banks and capital surcharges for the largest global SIFIs.\n\nThe Federal Reserve, working with other financial regulators, has issued a number of proposed and final rules relating to such areas as the centralized clearing of derivatives, swap margin requirements, and the designation of systemically important FMUs and nonbank financial firms. The proposed rule for designating nonbank financial firms was put out for comment in October. 2 This rule specifies a process for designating such institutions, starting by analyzing firms that exceed a size threshold and exhibit characteristics, including excessive leverage and reliance on short-term funding, that could contribute to systemic risk if the firm were to become distressed.\n\nLess-discernible progress has been made to date, however, in addressing other key vulnerabilities that came to the fore during the financial crisis. Indeed, short-term funding markets remain an important source of structural risk. Despite some significant reforms that enhance liquidity and impose additional restrictions on portfolios, money market funds are still susceptible to liquidity constraints largely because of attributes like their rounded net asset value (NAV) feature and the low risk tolerance of their investors. Options for further reforms being considered by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) include a mandatory floating NAV to mute the incentive for investors to be the first to redeem, capital buffers to allow funds to deal better with actual and potential losses while sustaining a stable NAV, and limits on redemptions both to provide more time for fund managers to address problems and to emphasize to investors that money market funds do not guarantee bank-like liquidity. 3\n\nThe triparty repurchase agreement (repo) market also continues to exhibit important vulnerabilities. In particular, the settlement process for triparty repo trades continues to rely on massive amounts of intraday credit and, as a result, remains vulnerable to a decision by a clearing bank to withhold funding from a market participant in default or perceived as facing distress. The FSOC has recommended reforms to deal with these problems, and an industry task force has taken some key initial steps in that direction--for example, by coordinating the implementation of a robust confirmation process for triparty trades. But more needs to be done. Indeed, given the centrality of this market to the financial system, taking further steps to reduce its vulnerabilities should be given a high priority.\n\nIn addition to addressing the unfinished business from the financial crisis, financial stability authorities and market participants need to be alert to new structures and products, not just those that caused problems in the past. New financial productsââfor example, exchange-traded funds and collateralized commercial paperââmay foster more efficient intermediation, but they may also raise systemic risk if they increase the complexity and interconnectedness of the financial system.\n\nAuthorities need to collect data and monitor risks associated with new products before the risks become salient. To improve the quality of financial-sector data and facilitate the analysis of data for the FSOC and its member agencies, the Dodd-Frank Act created the Office of Financial Research within the Treasury Department. The office has initiated a project to design a global classification system based on unique legal entity identifiers to identify parties to financial contracts. This system would allow market participants to better measure on a consolidated basis their counterparty risk across products and other dimensions. In addition, the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission recently issued a new reporting form for hedge funds and certain other private investment funds, which will provide more information on their size, concentration, funding, and investments; this additional information should shed some valuable light on an important segment of the financial sector for which we have not had consistent data.\n\nIdentifying and Addressing Cyclical Forms of Systemic Risk Turning next to cyclical forms of systemic risk, we are working to develop good measures of such risks, to monitor them on an ongoing basis, and to be aware of how they could unwind in a destabilizing way. On that score, at the Federal Reserve, we regularly monitor measures of leverage and maturity mismatch at financial intermediaries, and we look at asset valuations, underwriting standards for loans, and credit growth for signs of a credit-induced buildup of systemic risk. We also monitor various systemic risk measures for the largest banking firms. These measures capture financial market perceptions of the risk such a firm could impose on the broader financial system were it to become stressed. Such measures are based on firms' stock prices, credit default swap premiums, and stock price volatility, as well as the correlation in asset prices across firms.\n\nIn addition, we use regular stress tests of the nation's largest banking organizations to evaluate the ability of these firms to withstand worse-than-expected outcomes for the economy. These tests are based on detailed confidential data about the balance sheets of the large banks and provide a comprehensive and rigorous assessment of how their financial conditions would evolve over a multiyear period if economic and financial conditions were to deteriorate. The stress tests started in 2009 with the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP), and they continued with the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) in late 2010 and early 2011, in which we evaluated the capital planning processes of the firms and responded to requests to resume or increase shareholder payouts.\n\nIn a couple of weeks, we will begin CCAR 2012, building on the previous CCAR, and roughly a year from now, we will conduct the annual supervisory stress tests mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank tests will involve a larger group of banking organizations than the 19 firms covered in the SCAP and will be extended to include any financial institution the FSOC designates as systemically important. As additional data are collected on significant credit exposures, stress tests may evolve into an effective way to identify linkages across systemically important institutions that could lead them to fall into financial distress at the same time.\n\nAnother important element in identifying financial-sector vulnerabilities is the continued vigilance to the financial risks that might emerge in parts of the financial sector for which data are very scarce or that have developed more recently and are thus less well understood. The regulatory community has been working hard to fill these knowledge gaps. For example, in response to the need to improve the monitoring of leverage, particularly outside of the traditional banking system, the Federal Reserve instituted in 2010 a quarterly survey on dealer financing terms (the Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms). 4 This survey collects qualitative information on the leverage that dealers provide to financial market participants in the repo and OTC derivatives markets. This information complements the data on counterparty credit exposures that supervisors collect on a confidential basis from large, complex financial institutions and higher-frequency data on liquidity profiles. In addition, the Board staff is working in the context of the flow of funds accounts to develop measures of reliance by nonfinancial businesses on nonbank, volatile sources of funds--that is, the shadow banking sector. Such measures would permit us to track this source of risk through the business cycle.\n\nCyclical vulnerabilities seem relatively quiescent at present. Still, such vulnerabilities could easily emerge, especially once the economy starts to expand more robustly. Regulators need to look ahead and be ready to respond. A number of macroprudential policy tools could, in principle, be used to address heightened cyclical vulnerabilitiesââsome of which have been used in other countries and others that have been proposed but not yet tried. Examples of tools that have been used in other countries include time-varying caps on mortgage loan-to-value ratios and household debt-to-income ratios, which have been used in Korea and Hong Kong, and dynamic provisioning for losses by banks, which has been employed in Spain. The Basel III package of reforms that was agreed to last year includes a countercyclical capital buffer that can be imposed when excessive growth of risk-taking in credit markets results in an unacceptable level of systemic risk. Another policy that has been put forward but not yet tried is countercyclical margins and haircuts for funding contracts, as proposed by the Committee on the Global Financial System. 5\n\nOf course, U.S. policymakers will need to examine such policy tools in depth before implementing them here. As a first step, policymakers need to establish that countercyclical policy tools address cyclical vulnerabilities more effectively than simpler tools that are constant over the course of the cycle do. 6 In addition, in taking lessons from abroad, policymakers need to be aware of institutional differences that may prevent tools from having the same effects in the United States as they do elsewhere. A further issue is that the literature on the efficacy of macroprudential tools in limiting the buildup of cyclical systemic risks is still at an early stage. Even for policies that have been used in other countries, the number of papers that evaluate their effectiveness is relatively small, and isolating the effect of a specific policy amid an array of economic and financial developments is a persistent challenge. Nonetheless, these papers are encouragingââat least to the further consideration of the use of cyclical policy toolsââand this literature, which also includes more theoretical analyses of such policies, is a vibrant and growing one that should yield useful insights in coming years. 7\n\nCurrent Challenges Let me finish with a few words about current challenges to financial stability. In particular, concerns about European fiscal and banking issues have contributed to strains in global financial markets that pose significant downside risks to the U.S. economic outlook.\n\nU.S. banking institutions have manageable levels of direct exposure to the peripheral European countries but more substantial links to financial institutions in the larger European economies. In addition, some major European banks that obtain appreciable short-term wholesale U.S. dollar funding from U.S. money market funds appear to be facing significant funding pressures. In light of such international linkages, further intensification of financial disruptions in Europe could lead to a deterioration of financial conditions in the United States.\n\nThe European rescue package announced in late October indicates a strong commitment by European leaders to address the issues stemming from sovereign debt. The package was a step in the right direction, but many details of the plan were unclear, and the measures would require rigorous implementation. The continued rise in sovereign debt spreads for some countries, more generalized market volatility, and political turmoil that we have seen in recent days speak to the need for forceful action to stabilize the situation.\n\nWe, along with other supervisors, are actively engaged in ensuring that U.S. financial institutions are appropriately managing their credit and liquidity risks. To limit the spread of funding stresses, we have in place dollar liquidity swap lines with a number of foreign central banks. We are monitoring European developments very closely, and we will continue to do all that we can to mitigate the consequence of any adverse developments abroad on the U.S. financial system.\n\nConclusion The Federal Reserve and other U.S. financial regulators have accomplished a great deal since the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted a little more than a year ago. We have put into practice an institutional framework for undertaking a macroprudential approach to supervision and regulation, and we have implemented processes for identifying and responding to sources of systemic risk. However, much remains to be done, including further work to close the gaps in the data coverage of the financial sector and to deepen our understanding of the effectiveness of different policy tools. The bottom line is that developing an effective macroprudential policy is critical to preserving financial stability and supporting overall U.S. economic activity. Accomplishing this objective will be a considerable challenge, but it is one of great importance.\n\n1.

    "text": "January 08, 2011\n\nVice Chair Janet L. Yellen\n\nAt the The Brimmer Policy Forum, Allied Social Science Associations Annual Meeting, Denver, Colorado\n\nI am delighted to participate in this Brimmer Policy Forum, not least because this year marks the 45th anniversary of Andrew's appointment by President Johnson as a Governor of the Federal Reserve Board. Andrew's ongoing work in organizing this annual forum reflects his long-standing commitment to fostering economic analysis and public discourse on key policy issues.\n\nIn my remarks today, I will discuss the rationale for the decision by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in November to initiate a new program of asset purchases, and I will address some frequently asked questions (FAQs) regarding the program's economic and financial effects both here and abroad. 1 The purpose of the new asset purchase program, like all of the monetary policy actions taken by the FOMC since the onset of the global financial crisis, is to fulfill our congressionally mandated objectives of promoting maximum employment and price stability. In pursuit of these goals, the FOMC brought the target federal funds rate down close to zero by late 2008; conducted large-scale purchases of longer-term securities during 2009 and early 2010; and, last summer, modified its reinvestment policy to keep the Federal Reserve's balance sheet from shrinking as mortgage-related securities matured or were redeemed. In early November, the Committee announced that it intends to purchase an additional $600 billion in longer-term Treasury securities by the middle of this year.\n\nThe Rationale for the Asset Purchase Program\n\nMacroeconomic Conditions To understand the rationale for our asset purchase program, it is helpful to review the evolution of macroeconomic conditions over the past several years. The National Bureau of Economic Research has dated the recession as having begun in December 2007, but the pace of economic contraction accelerated in the wake of the Lehman Brothers collapse in September 2008 and the ensuing disruption to global financial markets. As shown in figure 1 , the unemployment rate rose from around 5 percent in the spring of 2008 to about 10 percent by the autumn of 2009 and has stayed well above 9 percent since then. Most observers, including myself, judge this level of unemployment to be much higher than levels consistent with full employment and stable inflation. For example, in a recent Survey of Professional Forecasters conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, the median estimate of the current level of structural unemployment--often referred to as the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU)--stood at about 5-3/4 percent, implying that the unemployment gap is nearly 4 percentage points.\n\nIn addition, a historically large fraction of the unemployed have been out of a job for a very long time. For example, roughly 4 percentage points of today's unemployment rate reflects individuals who have been unemployed for half a year or more. Those who experience an extended period of unemployment face a risk of losing their ability to participate successfully in the workforce, lending additional urgency to the task of reviving the demand for labor.\n\nSuch low rates of resource utilization are typically accompanied by falling inflation. And, indeed, as shown in figure 2 , measures of inflation for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) have declined significantly since 2008. For the total PCE inflation rate, the underlying trend is obscured to some extent by large swings in energy prices. However, the downward trend is clearly evident from the evolution of core PCE inflation, which excludes the volatile prices of food and energy. The 12-month change in core PCE prices dropped from about 2-1/2 percent in mid-2008 to around 1â1/2 percent in 2009 and declined further to less than 1 percent by late 2010. 2\n\nAs inflation has trended downward, measures of underlying inflation have fallen somewhat below the levels of about 2 percent or a bit less that most Committee participants judge to be consistent, over the longer run, with the FOMC's dual mandate. In particular, a modest positive rate of inflation over time allows for a slightly higher average level of nominal interest rates, thereby creating more scope for the FOMC to respond to adverse shocks. A modest positive inflation rate also reduces the risk that such shocks could result in deflation, which can be associated with poor macroeconomic performance.\n\nOf course, if incoming information last autumn had been pointing to greater momentum in the prospects for economic growth or to a rapid escalation in inflation, then the case for further monetary policy easing might have seemed less pressing. However, such was not the case. The Federal Reserve publishes a Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) four times a year in conjunction with the FOMC minutes. As shown in the November SEP, most Committee participants anticipated that the economy would recover only gradually and projected that the unemployment rate would still be at around 8 percent at the end of 2012--an outlook that is shared by most outside forecasters. Similarly, Committee participants generally expected inflation to rise very gradually toward levels consistent with the Federal Reserve's mandate. Moreover, continuing downside risks to the outlook for economic activity and inflation strengthened the case for providing additional monetary policy accommodation, thereby reducing the risk of another downturn in economic activity or a further decline in inflation.\n\nThe Design of the Asset Purchase Program In weighing its policy options last autumn, the Committee gave careful consideration to the question of whether further purchases of longer-term Treasury securities were likely to be effective in fostering economic recovery and bringing inflation back up to levels judged to be consistent with the dual mandate. 3 In my judgment, both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence suggested that such purchases could provide effective stimulus by keeping longer-term interest rates lower than they would otherwise be.\n\nThe underlying theory, in which asset prices are directly linked to the outstanding quantity of assets, dates back to the early 1950s. 4 For example, in preferred-habitat models, short- and long-term assets are imperfect substitutes in investors' portfolios, and the effect of arbitrageurs is limited by their risk aversion or by market frictions such as capital constraints. Consequently, the term structure of interest rates can be influenced by exogenous shocks in supply and demand at specific maturities. Purchases of longer-term securities by the central bank can be viewed as a shift in supply that tends to push up the prices and drive down the yields on those securities.\n\nIn the context of such an analytical framework, the effect of an asset purchase program also depends on investors' perceptions of the future path of short-term interest rates as well as their perceptions of the timing and pace of the central bank's eventual unwinding of its asset purchases. Thus, central bank communication may play a key role in influencing the financial market response to such a program.\n\nRecent empirical work provides a rough gauge of the quantitative effects of longer-term securities purchases. 5 For example, event studies have investigated the short-term response of asset prices to announcements by the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England regarding their respective asset purchase programs. And regression analysis has been used to estimate statistical models that embed predictions from a specific theoretical framework.\n\nTable 1 summarizes the response of selected financial variables on four dates associated with the Federal Reserve's first round of asset purchases. On November 25, 2008, the Federal Reserve announced that it would purchase up to $600 billion in agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and agency debt. On December 1, Chairman Bernanke provided further details in a speech. 6 On December 16, the program was formally launched by the FOMC. 7 On March 18, 2009, the FOMC announced that the program would be expanded by an additional $850 billion in purchases of agency MBS and agency debt and $300 billion in purchases of Treasury securities. As is evident from the table, these announcements were generally associated with a substantial decline in the 10-year Treasury yield and the yield on 10-year Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) as well as in rates on agency MBS and corporate debt.\n\nTurning now to the macroeconomic effects of the Federal Reserve's securities purchases, there are several distinct channels through which these purchases tend to influence aggregate demand, including a reduced cost of credit to consumers and businesses, a rise in asset prices that boosts household wealth and spending, and a moderate change in the foreign exchange value of the dollar that provides support to net exports. The quantitative magnitude of these effects can be gauged using a macroeconometric model such as FRB/US--one of the models developed and maintained by Board staff and used routinely in simulations of alternative economic scenarios.\n\nFigure 3 depicts the results of such a simulation exercise, as reported in a recent research paper by four Federal Reserve System economists. 8 For illustrative purposes, the simulation imposes the assumption that the purchases of $600 billion in longer-term Treasury securities are completed within about a year, that the elevated level of securities holdings is then maintained for about two years, and that the asset position is then unwound linearly over the following five years. 9\n\nThis trajectory of securities holdings causes the 10-year Treasury yield to decline initially about 1/4 percentage point and then gradually return toward baseline over subsequent years. That path of longer-term Treasury yields leads to a significant pickup in real gross domestic product (GDP) growth relative to baseline and generates an increase in nonfarm payroll employment that amounts to roughly 700,000 jobs. 10 It should also be noted that this exercise is performed as a deterministic simulation and hence does not capture the potential benefits of the asset purchase program in mitigating downside risks to economic activity and inflation.\n\nI would also like to note that the same research paper analyzed the macroeconomic effects of the FOMC's full program of securities purchases, including the first round of purchases that was initiated in late 2008 and early 2009, the modification of the reinvestment policy that was announced last August, and the second round of purchases that was initiated in November. Those simulation results indicate that by 2012, the full program of securities purchases will have raised private payroll employment by about 3 million jobs. Moreover, the simulations suggest that inflation is currently a percentage point higher than would have been the case if the FOMC had never initiated a securities purchases, implying that, in the absence of such purchases, the economy would now be close to deflation. 11\n\nAddressing Some FAQs about the Asset Purchase Program\n\nHas the Program Been Effective in Promoting the Economic Recovery? Is the program actually proving effective? My short answer is yes. Table 2 depicts financial market responses during three key phases in the rollout of the program: (1) August 10, 2010, when the FOMC announced that the Federal Reserve would begin reinvesting principal payments on agency MBS and agency debt by purchasing Treasury securities; (2) the period between August 11 and November 2; and (3) November 3, the date on which the FOMC meeting statement announced the commencement of the program.\n\nAs shown in the table, the initiation of the securities purchase program at the November FOMC meeting occasioned only minimal market response. The reason is that it was largely anticipated by investors, having been the subject of extensive public discussions by Federal Reserve officials during late summer and early autumn. Importantly, as expectations of the program gradually became embedded in asset prices during late summer and early autumn, the 10-year TIPS yield dropped nearly 1/2 percentage point over the period between the August and November FOMC meetings; moreover, equity prices rose and corporate bond spreads narrowed. Over that period, of course, asset prices were also responding to economic news and some favorable corporate earnings reports, but the overall pattern of the financial market data bolstered my confidence in the effectiveness of the Federal Reserve's securities purchases in providing additional monetary policy accommodation. Indeed, market rates might well have backed up significantly following the November FOMC meeting if the Committee had decided not to move ahead with the program. 12\n\nAs shown in figure 4 , longer-term Treasury yields have risen substantially over the past couple of months since the FOMC initiated this round of asset purchases. I believe that this increase in Treasury yields likely reflects a number of significant factors, including incoming information suggesting a somewhat stronger economic outlook and the fiscal package that was announced by President Obama in early December and approved by the Congress about two weeks later; that package will not only support economic growth next year but will also increase the amount of federal debt issuance. Also, investors appear to have scaled back their expectations about the extent to which the FOMC will engage in further purchases beyond those already announced; however, the effect of that reassessment on market rates tends to bolster the view that the Federal Reserve's securities purchases do indeed affect yields in the direction indicated by analytical and empirical studies. 13\n\nWill the Asset Purchase Program Lead to Excessive Inflation? A concern voiced by some observers is that the asset purchase program will lead to excessive inflation. One rationale for this view is that the economy is currently operating with little slack--that is, an unemployment rate that is not far from the NAIRU. A second rationale is that asset purchases have ballooned the Fed's balance sheet and the supply of bank reserves. I will consider each argument in turn.\n\nExtent of slack in the economy. Some proponents of the view that the U.S. economy is operating close to the NAIRU point to an apparent outward shift in the Beveridge curve--the relationship between job vacancies and unemployment--as indicating an increase in the structural level of unemployment. In the simplest framework, movements along a downward sloping Beveridge curve are typically characterized as cyclical movements in labor market conditions, while persistent inward and outward shifts in the curve are frequently attributed to structural forces.\n\nAs shown in figure 5 , the Beveridge curve appears to have shifted out in recent years. However, the Beveridge curve can shift out for a variety of reasons, including some that are essentially cyclical in nature, so it is important to understand the sources of a shift to assess whether it represents persistent structural forces.\n\nThere is some evidence suggesting that structural factors account for a portion of the Beveridge curve's outward shift. In particular, the shift may partly reflect a decline in the efficiency with which unemployed workers are matched to vacant jobs. 14 However, given that the apparent decline in matching efficiency coincided with a large reduction in job vacancies, the two developments may be related. In particular, weak labor demand may be causing the labor market to operate less efficiently than would typically be the case, and matching efficiency may return to normal as demand for workers improves. Indeed, historically, matching efficiency does appear to move back toward its long-run average over time. 15 That said, a persistently high level of long-term unemployment could lead to a significant increase in structural unemployment over time as individuals who are out of work for long periods face the erosion of their skills. However, such effects would take time to materialize and, in any event, would argue for aggressive policies to reduce unemployment promptly.\n\nAnother portion of the recent outward shift in the Beveridge curve is likely due to increases in the maximum duration of unemployment benefits, which may have induced some unemployed workers to be more selective in the job offers they accept. However, recent research suggests that the increase in unemployment due to extended benefits is probably small relative to the overall increase in unemployment, and, regardless of its magnitude, the influence of extended unemployment benefits will disappear as the economy improves and extended benefits expire. 16\n\nMoreover, at least some of the recent outward shift in the Beveridge curve appears to reflect cyclical rather than structural influences. For example, vacancies typically adjust more quickly than unemployment to changes in labor demand, causing counterclockwise movements in vacancy-unemployment space that can look like shifts in the Beveridge curve. Indeed, as is evident from the figure, such counterclockwise movements have occurred in most previous recessions.\n\nFinally, it is worth emphasizing that most of the co-movement between unemployment and vacancies in recent years does not appear especially unusual. In particular, low vacancies and elevated layoffs--likely driven by weak labor demand--can account for much of the increase in unemployment that has occurred since mid-2008. 17 This observation is in accord with the recent behavior of inflation, which, as noted above, has trended down over the past three years, consistent with a decline in rates of resource utilization. Likewise, nominal wage growth has fallen noticeably over the past several years and remains quite low.\n\nIn sum, while deficient labor demand may not be the only factor boosting unemployment currently, and while disentangling the various influences on unemployment is not straightforward, weak labor demand appears to be the predominant factor keeping the unemployment rate elevated. This weakness, in turn, implies that current resource utilization is likely well below normal levels, mitigating the risk that the policy stimulus from our asset purchase program will lead to excessive inflation.\n\nInflation and bank reserves. A second reason that some observers worry that the Fed's asset purchase programs could raise inflation is that these programs have increased the quantity of bank reserves far above pre-crisis levels. I strongly agree with one aspect of this argument--the notion that an accommodative monetary policy left in place too long can cause inflation to rise to undesirable levels. This notion would be true regardless of the level of bank reserves and pertains as well in situations in which monetary policy is unconstrained by the zero bound on interest rates. Indeed, it is one reason why the Committee stated that it will review its asset purchase program regularly in light of incoming information and adjust the program as needed to meet its objectives. We recognize that the FOMC must withdraw monetary stimulus once the recovery has taken hold and the economy is improving at a healthy pace. Importantly, the Committee remains unwaveringly committed to price stability and does not seek inflation above the level of 2 percent or a bit less than that, which most FOMC participants see as consistent with the Federal Reserve's mandate.\n\nIn contrast, I disagree with the notion that the large quantity of reserves resulting from our asset purchases poses some special barrier to removing policy stimulus when the right time comes. The FOMC will be able to increase short-term rates by raising the interest rate that we pay on excess reserves--currently 1/4 percent. That ability will allow us to manage short-term interest rates effectively and thus to tighten policy when needed, even if bank reserves remain high.\n\nGiven the very high level of reserve balances, changes in the interest rate on reserves might not be fully reflected in the federal funds rate and other short-term market rates. In that event, the Federal Reserve can use tools it has developed and tested to drain or immobilize bank reserves, thereby enhancing our control over the federal funds rate. To build the capability to drain large quantities of reserves, the Federal Reserve has expanded the range of its counterparties for reverse repurchase operations beyond the primary dealers and has developed the infrastructure necessary to use agency MBS as collateral in such transactions. The Federal Reserve has also put in place a Term Deposit Facility through which it can offer deposits to member institutions that are roughly analogous to the certificates of deposit that these institutions offer to their customers. We have tested both of these tools by conducting several small-scale operations and have the ability to initiate them quickly if needed. The use of reverse repurchase operations and the Term Deposit Facility would allow the Federal Reserve to drain hundreds of billions of dollars of reserves from the banking system should conditions necessitate. We don't think that draining such large amounts of reserves will be necessary for a smooth exit, but it makes sense to be prepared, and hence we have followed this \"belt and suspenders\" approach.\n\nFinally, we can sell portions of our holdings of MBS, agency debt, and Treasury securities if we determine that doing so is an appropriate way of tightening financial conditions when the time comes. The redemption or sale of securities would have the effect of reducing the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet as well as further reducing the quantity of reserves in the banking system. Restoring the size and composition of the balance sheet to a more normal configuration is a longer-term objective of our policies. Any such sales would be at a gradual pace, would be clearly communicated to market participants, and would entail appropriate consideration of economic conditions.\n\nIn short, the range of tools we have developed will permit us to raise short-term interest rates and drain large volumes of reserves when it becomes necessary to achieve the policy stance that fosters our macroeconomic objectives--including the objective of maintaining price stability.\n\nWill the Asset Purchase Program Result in Adverse Financial Imbalances? The Committee's intention in implementing asset purchases is to hold down the level of longer-term interest rates to make credit more affordable for businesses and households. A reasonable fear is that this process could go too far, encouraging potential borrowers to employ excessive leverage to take advantage of low financing costs and leading investors to accept less compensation for bearing risks as they seek to enhance their rates of return in an environment of very low yields.\n\nThis concern deserves to be taken seriously, and the Federal Reserve is carefully monitoring financial indicators for signs of potential threats to financial stability. While there is no single metric we can use to assess these threats, standard financial market indicators do not currently signal significant excesses or imbalances in the United States. In the stock market, for example, price-to-earnings ratios, by some measures, remain below their averages over the past several decades, and other valuation measures also indicate that equity prices are not significantly out of alignment with past norms. In the real estate market, price-to-rent ratios for both residential and commercial real estate are now within a reasonable range of their long-run averages, in contrast to the severe misalignment that occurred prior to the crisis. Again, there is little sign here of imbalances relative to fundamentals, at least if history is used as a guide. In fixed-income markets, narrow risk spreads and risk premiums could be signs of excessive risk-taking by investors, and indeed spreads on corporate bonds have dropped dramatically since the financial crisis, as the economic outlook has improved and investor sentiment has picked up. Risk premiums on nonfinancial corporate bonds, as measured by forward spreads far in the future, are relatively low compared with historical norms, although other indicators for this market do not point to overvaluation.\n\nAn alternative way to identify imbalances is to focus more directly on measuring credit flows and exposures to credit risk. Extraordinarily rapid credit growth may be a sign that financial institutions are taking greater risks onto their balance sheets. In recent months, nonfinancial corporations have issued large amounts of bonds and syndicated leveraged loans, and banks' provision of consumer credit has shown some signs of reviving. Nonetheless, a portion of the recent corporate issuance has been used to refinance existing debt, including leveraged loans; small business lending remains especially weak; and commercial and residential mortgage originations continue to shrink. Thus, there is little evidence that financial institutions are significantly expanding the level of credit and liquidity provided to households and businesses on net. Indeed, given the current very low level of interest rates and the continuation of the economic recovery, credit flows remain stubbornly sluggish.\n\nOf course, such aggregate measures provide only an imperfect picture of overall credit conditions. Another type of evidence comes from surveying market participants about their practices. For bank lending, we have the Federal Reserve's Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, which provides information about changes in supply and demand for bank loans to businesses and households. Recent surveys have indicated that banks have only just begun to reverse the historically large tightening in standards and terms that they implemented in the aftermath of the crisis. In fact, considerably more easing of terms and standards will probably be required before lending conditions return to normal.\n\nTo monitor leverage provided by dealers to financial market participants, last June the Federal Reserve launched the Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms. This survey provides information on credit terms and availability of various forms of dealer-intermediated financing, including funding for securities positions and over-the-counter derivatives. The survey results suggest that over the past several months there has been some easing of terms applicable to financing for a range of counterparty types and many types of collateral, as well as an increase in demand from clients to fund most types of securities. These results indicate that the availability and use of leverage by nonbank financial institutions increased somewhat last year. Overall, a variety of indicators suggest that leverage generally remains well below the levels reached prior to the financial crisis, but these measures are worth watching closely, and the new survey reflects our strong commitment to developing additional tools for this purpose.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is closely monitoring many indicators of financial conditions to better understand the implications of financial market developments for the economy as well as risks to the financial system itself. We are working with other regulators to make the financial system more robust and are attentive in our supervision to developments that may affect systemic risk. If evidence of financial imbalances were to develop, I believe that supervision and regulation should provide the first line of defense so that monetary policy can concentrate on its longstanding goals of price stability and maximum employment. That said, we cannot categorically rule out using monetary policy to address financial imbalances, given the damage that they can cause.\n\nWill the Asset Purchase Program Have Adverse Effects on Foreign Economies? My final FAQ relates to the concerns that some observers have expressed over the potential for the Federal Reserve's asset purchase program to have adverse effects on foreign economies. One specific concern is that these securities purchases might drive down the value of the U.S. dollar, thereby diverting demand from our trading partners. Although purchases of longer-term securities are a less conventional means of conducting monetary policy than the more familiar approach of managing short-term interest rates, the goals and transmission mechanisms are actually very similar, and there is nothing special about these asset purchases that would make them especially likely to weigh on the dollar.\n\nIn fact, the evidence available to date suggests that the asset purchases have had only moderate effects on the foreign exchange value of the dollar. This point is illustrated in table 3 , which reports the change in U.S. dollar exchange rates against four other currencies (the Canadian dollar, pound sterling, euro, and yen) on each of the four dates referred to in table 1. These movements in exchange rates are not particularly large when compared with the fluctuations that can occur in any given week or month. Indeed, as shown in figure 6 , these exchange rate movements are very modest in the broader context of developments over the past several years.\n\nA related concern raised by some observers is that the Federal Reserve's asset purchases may induce excessive capital inflows to emerging market economies (EMEs)--inflows that in turn could put unwelcome upward pressure on the currencies of those EMEs and perhaps even contribute to asset price bubbles. As shown in figure 7 , net private capital flows to Latin American and Asian EMEs (reported as a share of the aggregate GDP of those EMEs) were substantial in the second half of 2009 and the first half of 2010 but were not obviously outsized compared with levels prior to the crisis. 18 A similar pattern is evident in figure 8 , which depicts the net inflows since 2007 into mutual funds investing in EME bonds and equities. In each case, the strong inflows over the past year or so reflect a recovery in the wake of the large outflows that occurred during the crisis. In fact, the stock of claims on EMEs has only returned to its pre-crisis trend.\n\nAccommodative monetary policies in the advanced economies, including the Federal Reserve's asset purchases, have likely played some role in widening interest rate differentials and encouraging capital flows to EMEs. But this role should not be exaggerated. Other factors--including a reversal of the capital outflows from EMEs during the financial crisis and the EMEs' longer-term favorable growth prospects--likely have also been important. Moreover, it would be a mistake to portray these capital flows as an unmitigated negative for the EMEs. A rebalanced global economy in which EMEs depend more on domestic demand for their growth will likely involve ultimately stronger and more sustained capital flows to these economies.\n\nFinally, I would like to comment on the critique that our asset purchase program is meant to promote U.S. growth at the expense of other nations by depreciating the dollar and enhancing U.S. competitiveness. That argument ignores the fact that stimulating growth in the United States is also likely to boost our demand for foreign goods and promote growth abroad. This effect will provide an important offset to the other implication of U.S. monetary stimulus that I discussed earlier--that it may lead to moderate movements in the foreign exchange value of the dollar that tend to lower U.S. demand for foreign goods. Whether foreign demand is ultimately boosted or diminished by U.S. monetary policy depends on the relative sizes of these two effects and is ultimately an empirical question. 19 However, given the moderate exchange rate effects that we believe the Federal Reserve's asset purchases have had, it seems likely to me that, as seems to be the case with conventional monetary easing achieved by lowering interest rates, our decision to purchase assets will not hinder foreign growth. In particular, given the importance of the United States in the global economy, it is hard to believe that any foreign country would gain if our economy were to fall back into another recession. Over the longer term, the health and vitality of the global economy will depend importantly on the sustained, vigorous recovery in the United States that our asset purchase program is intended to support.\n\nConclusion In closing, let me reiterate that the program of asset purchases initiated by the Federal Open Market Committee in November is intended to support economic recovery from an exceptionally deep recession and to restore inflation to, but not above, levels that FOMC participants consider consistent with price stability. It will not be a panacea, but I believe it will be effective in fostering maximum employment and price stability.\n\nReferences\n\nBarnichon, Regis, and Andrew Figura (2010). \" What Drives Movements in the Unemployment Rate?

For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas constructs a trimmed-mean rate of PCE inflation by removing the tails of the distribution of monthly price changes for disaggregated spending categories. That measure of underlying inflation has also declined fairly steadily since mid-2008 and dipped slightly below 1 percent last autumn. Moreover, diffusion indexes of price changes--which subtract the percentage of items in the consumption basket with price increases from the percentage of items with price decreases--also fell noticeably over this period, providing further evidence that the decline in inflation has been widespread across many categories of consumer spending.

    "text": "October 11, 2010\n\nVice Chair Janet L. Yellen\n\nAt the  Annual Meeting of the National Association for Business Economics, Denver, Colorado\n\nThank you for that very kind introduction. When I look at the roster of previous recipients of the Adam Smith Award, it is very august company indeed. It's a tremendous honor to appear before you this year, and I am very grateful. 1\n\nI should stress that my remarks represent my own views and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve colleagues. Today I would like to cover a subject that is of surpassing importance for economic policy: the implications of financial market excesses for the supervision of the financial system, and beyond that, for the formulation of monetary policy.\n\nJust two years ago, we lived through an almost unimaginable catastrophe--the near collapse of a global financial system that many economists had come to believe was impervious to the sort of panic that could bring on a worldwide recession. The prevailing view was that modern economic policymaking, and central banking in particular, had mastered the management of the business cycle, and that the application of modern risk-management tools had greatly increased the stability of the financial system. Financial markets were not held to be perfect, of course. But they were viewed as self-correcting systems that tended to return to a stable equilibrium before they could inflict widespread damage on the real economy.\n\nThat view lies in tatters today as we look at tens of millions of unemployed and the trillions of dollars of lost output and lost wealth around the world. These events should have convinced any doubters that our financial system is vulnerable to the kinds of catastrophic breakdowns that can wreck the overall economy. An inescapable conclusion is that a first-order priority must be to engineer a stronger, more robust system of financial regulation and supervision--one capable of identifying and managing excesses before they lead to crises. We must find a way to contain these threats without putting a straitjacket on financial innovation and risk-taking. I don't claim this is an easy task, but it is an essential one.\n\nLessons from the Crisis It is now clear that our system of regulation and supervision was fatally flawed. Despite volumes of research on financial market metrics and weighty position papers on financial stability, the fact is that we simply didn't understand some of the most dangerous systemic threats. Looking back, I believe the regulatory community was lulled into complacency by a combination of a Panglossian worldview and benign experience. The notion that financial markets should be as free as possible from regulatory fetters had evolved into the conviction that those markets could, to a very considerable extent, police themselves. Meanwhile, things went along so well for so long that the common belief came to be that nothing could go disastrously wrong. Over a period of decades, the financial system was tested repeatedly--the Latin American debt crisis, the savings and loan crisis, the Asian crisis, the failure of Long-Term Capital Management, and the stock market crashes of the late 1980s and early 2000s. With each crisis, policymakers rolled up their sleeves and beat back the systemic threat. The levees held. Despite these financial market ups and downs, economies in the United States and other parts of the world performed very well. We appeared to have entered a new era of stability. We even gave it a name: the Great Moderation. We were left with the mirage of a system that we thought was invulnerable to shock, a financial Maginot Line that we believed couldn't be breached. We now know that this sense of invincibility was mere hubris.\n\nTo understand what went wrong, I refer you to Hyman Minsky's path-breaking work on speculative financial booms and busts. 2 As Minsky showed, success can lead to excess, and excess to ruin. The Great Moderation saw a progressive growth of credit and extension of risk, which came to a head in the mortgage market. Credit flowed freely and cheaply, and households and financial institutions alike took on greater risk, borrowing to the hilt. House prices soared off the charts. Financial innovators found increasingly exotic ways of packaging loans for investors. Securities became so opaque that few understood their risks. Originators sold mortgages to investors whose due diligence consisted of glancing at ratings. The financial system became increasingly complex, interconnected, and hyperleveraged.\n\nWhen housing prices plunged, the value of real-estate-related assets on the balance sheets of financial institutions, both in the traditional and shadow banking sectors, collapsed. Not only were many of those institutions highly leveraged, they had also relied heavily on short-term borrowing to acquire those assets. The combination of leverage and short maturity funding left them perilously vulnerable to runs. The result was panic and market breakdowns on an unimaginable scale, bringing us frighteningly close to a meltdown of the global financial system and a second Great Depression.\n\nThankfully, that depression never occurred. Governments and central banks around the world took extraordinary action to prevent complete collapse. But what we did get was bad enough--the deepest and most prolonged recession in generations. And the recovery has been agonizingly slow, held back, in part, by the ongoing efforts of overleveraged households and financial institutions to repair their balance sheets. These events demonstrate both the natural tendency of the financial system to cycle through booms and busts and the potential, absent adequate supervision and regulation, for breakdowns in the financial system to threaten the global economy.\n\nFinancial market participants can be bipolar--prone to fads, manias, myopia, panics, and depression; driven by short-term gain; and easily caught up in the madness of crowds. One's belief about the beliefs of others is critical, like Keynes's example of a beauty contest. 3 In addition, the structure of compensation and incentives in the financial sector created strong motives for excessive risk-taking, especially during boom years. Methods of modern risk management may have intensified the cycle because of their reliance on metrics such as value at risk that are highly sensitive to recent performance, especially volatility. In good times, volatility declined, and value at risk along with it. This pattern generated a pro-cyclical willingness to take on risk and leverage, amplifying and propagating the boom and bust cycle. The vicious cycle of a collapse of confidence, asset fire sales, evaporation of liquidity, and a deleveraging free fall was the mirror image of the manic mortgage market that preceded it.\n\nTo avoid a repeat of these events, it is essential that we change the landscape of supervision and regulation. The landmark legislation recently passed by the Congress, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), is designed to do just that. It requires regulators to contain risks to the financial system before they erupt into crises. And it creates a structure to collect data, identify emerging threats to financial stability, and formulate policies to contain these risks.\n\nWithin this structure, the Federal Reserve will play an important role. We will supervise all systemically important institutions and, jointly with other regulators in the new Financial Stability Oversight Council, establish stricter prudential standards for such firms. We will help ensure the safety of financial market utilities that are critical to our payment, clearing, and settlement systems. And we will actively support the council's mission to identify and address emerging risks to financial stability. At the same time, though, we must take care to preserve incentives for innovation and reasonable risk-taking. We must remain prudent, while avoiding an overly strict approach that unduly impedes financial intermediation and stifles capital formation.\n\nVigilance to threats of systemic financial risk must also inform the conduct of monetary policy. We have seen that the eruption of a financial crisis can have severe economic consequences, compromising the ability of a central bank to attain its primary macroeconomic objectives. Monetary policymakers should also be aware that the decisions they make in pursuit of price stability and full employment could, in some circumstances, affect the development of systemic risk. For example, if compensation incentives in the financial sector are misaligned, low interest rates might heighten the ability and desire of financial market participants to reach for yield and take on risk.\n\nOur goal should be to deploy an enhanced arsenal of regulatory tools to address systemic risk, making the financial system far more robust. That way, monetary policy can concentrate on its long-standing goals of price stability and maximum employment. Supervision and regulation must serve as the first and main line of defense in addressing systemic risk. We have at our disposal a tool kit of regulatory instruments that are well adapted for this purpose. Monetary policy cannot be a primary instrument for systemic risk management. First, it has its own macroeconomic goals on which it must maintain a sharp focus. Second, it is too blunt an instrument for dealing with systemic risk. All the same, I cannot unequivocally rule out the possibility that situations could emerge in which monetary policy should play some role in reining in risk-taking behavior. I will return to this point later.\n\nIn the remainder of my remarks, I will discuss key issues that must be resolved before an effective policy regime for the containment of systemic risk can be established. First, we must understand the sources of systemic risk and design surveillance practices that enable us to detect threats to financial stability early on. Second, we must develop a tool kit of supervisory policy instruments--so-called macroprudential policies--and guidelines on how and when to deploy them. And third, we must strive to avoid situations in which macroprudential and monetary policies are working at cross-purposes, given that macroprudential policies affect macroeconomic performance and that monetary policy may affect risk-taking incentives.\n\nAll of these issues raise complex questions of design and implementation. Interesting parallels may be drawn, however, between the design issues we face in macroprudential policy and those we have grappled with in conducting monetary policy. These parallels include the appropriate roles of rules versus discretion, the need for policies that are robust in addressing uncertainty, and the assignment problem, all of which I will discuss later. The fertile field of monetary policy research may therefore offer lessons that can fruitfully be applied to managing systemic risk.\n\nSystemic Risk: Sources and Surveillance At its most basic level, systemic risk stems from the possibility that some event or sequence of events could result in severe impairment of the financial sector's ability to provide credit in the economy. At their most extreme, such events can trigger panicky attempts to withdraw credit, creating runs that lead to failures of important financial institutions and, ultimately, systemic collapse.\n\nIf policymakers are to detect emerging threats to the financial system, we must understand the determinants of systemic risk and develop appropriate metrics for measuring it. Economists have long studied these issues, and the recent crisis has intensified research on the subject. This work points to several key elements in the buildup of risks in the financial system. Let me mention three factors that current research suggests are critical.\n\nOne factor is the accumulation in the financial sector of very high levels of risk and leverage, along with excessive reliance on unstable short-term funding. The emergence of such behavior among the largest and most interconnected financial institutions is particularly dangerous, since these institutions are linchpins in our financial system and their failure could cause significant damage to large numbers of counterparties and the system as a whole, as the examples of Lehman Brothers and American International Group demonstrate. However, a buildup of leverage and growing maturity mismatches are also worrisome when they occur more broadly in the financial system.\n\nA second element is a high positive correlation of risk exposures across institutions. A wide array of commercial banks, investment banks, and other financial institutions held mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, or positions in mortgage-related derivatives. The result was the massive vulnerability of the financial system to a collapse of housing prices. What seemed like moderate risks taken by individual institutions ultimately led to an enormous risk to the system as a whole.\n\nA third element is the extraordinary interconnectedness and complexity within the financial system. The intricate and opaque web of connections among financial players multiplies the dangers of contagion in the form of lost confidence, frozen liquidity, fire sales, and domino effects. 4 A key factor in this channel of systemic risk is the institutional arrangements in payment, clearing, and settlement systems. For example, weaknesses in the market infrastructure for repurchase agreements, or repos, and over-the-counter derivatives intensified the crisis. 5\n\nSystemic risk reflects the confluence of factors that may grow slowly over years. Therefore, surveillance must look at a variety of indicators and be forward looking, considering the paths of factors that influence such risk for years to come. To facilitate timely recognition of the emergence of systemic risk, we should design quantifiable indicators related to the three elements I just outlined: risk buildup at systemically important institutions and within the financial sector more broadly, positive correlations of risk among financial market participants, and interconnectedness among those participants.\n\nSystemic risk surveillance will demand Herculean efforts by the regulatory agencies and the Office of Financial Research created by the new legislation. I see parallels between the way we take the pulse of the economy when considering monetary policy decisions and the way we should monitor and evaluate systemic risk when formulating macroprudential policies. In assessing the economy, we collect and analyze a myriad of data. In practice, though, we regard certain metrics as most critical, such as gross domestic product, employment and unemployment, and inflation. Similarly, in risk surveillance, we will gather an array of data on risk spreads, credit flows and volumes, asset prices, debt and leverage, markets, and institutions, including detailed, often proprietary, microdata on balance sheets and data from such markets as those for over-the-counter derivatives and repos. Nonetheless, surveillance is likely to concentrate on key factors in the buildup of systemic risk such as the ones I identified: the accumulation of credit and funding risk on the balance sheets of systemically important institutions and throughout the financial system, the correlation of risk among financial market participants, and the extent of counterparty exposures.\n\nOf course, we must also keep a close eye on broad credit and asset market conditions. One strand of surveillance will involve watching variations of risk and term spreads of bonds and other securities relative to historical norms. Narrow risk spreads and risk premiums may be a harbinger of excessive risk-taking by investors. Another strand will focus more directly on measuring credit flows and exposures to credit risk. If overall credit growth is extraordinarily rapid, it may be a sign that financial institutions are taking greater risks onto their balance sheets. Because of financial system complexity, leverage is impossible to measure perfectly. Still, real-time indicators of the leverage of financial intermediaries would help identify where we are in a credit cycle. For example, we can look at the marginal leverage of new borrowing by examining data on collateral haircuts. We may also monitor data on repo market activity and haircuts to spot vulnerabilities relating to maturity mismatches. This information can be crosschecked against firm- and sector-level data on credit risk exposure.\n\nOne aspect of systemic risk surveillance that has garnered a great deal of attention is the identification of asset price bubbles. Bubbles present systemic danger when major financial institutions use leverage to finance investment in risky assets that they hold on their balance sheets. The systemic risk is multiplied when the asset bubble is accompanied by a credit bubble that fuels highly leveraged investment. 6 So a top priority of systemic risk surveillance must be to assess whether asset price movements suggest the presence of a bubble and identify at an early stage those that might be particularly dangerous. In practice, of course, we will have highly uncertain notions of when excesses evolve into bubbles. Near the end of a bubble, it's pretty clear that something is amiss. But by then it's too late to do much about it.\n\nWe will also need to monitor the cross-sectional correlations of firms' risk exposures. 7 In addition, we need information on counterparty exposures through derivatives and other financial instruments. Finally, further development of financial sector stress testing, building on the tests carried out in the United States in 2009 and in Europe this year, will provide valuable information about the ability of the financial system to weather significant economic or financial shocks. We should refine the stress-testing methodology as we develop a more sophisticated understanding of institution-level systemic risk factors. These enhancements can be carried out by the quantitative surveillance unit that we have already established in our supervision of the largest financial institutions to better integrate macroprudential considerations with regular supervisory practice.\n\nQualitative information on credit will complement the quantitative evidence. The Fed recently introduced the Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms, adding to the information collected from the existing commercial bank Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, a survey on credit supply and demand. 8\n\nSystemic risk surveillance is both a science and an art: science in that we will analyze closely a wide range of data that research shows to be diagnostic, and art in that we will have to exercise judgment about when excesses become so dangerous that action is required. The Fed and other regulators in the United States and abroad have made important progress in developing systemic risk indicators. Still, we must recognize the inherent difficulty in forecasting crises and acknowledge the failure of past risk-monitoring efforts. Moreover, we must be mindful of the inadequacy of indicators that focus too specifically on the markets and channels that transmitted the crisis of 2007 and 2008. Like Tolstoy's unhappy families, every financial crisis is a crisis in its own way. For that reason, we need a flexible approach that combines science and art, and judgmentally weighs information from all indicators.\n\nMacroprudential Policy Implementation Refining our ability to identify systemic threats is well and good. But when we detect a threat, what will we do about it? This question brings me to the tools and implementation of macroprudential policies. The first tool is information to help focus attention in policy circles, and among investors and the public, on looming systemic risks. The detailed financial stability reports published by the International Monetary Fund and a number of central banks are intended to serve this purpose. 9 And the Financial Stability Oversight Council created under the Dodd-Frank Act is charged with preparing such a report once a year.\n\nAdmittedly, most such reports failed to identify the mechanisms behind the recent crisis. And even when vulnerabilities were identified and warning bells sounded, they were often greeted with yawns, as anyone who remembers the phrase \"irrational exuberance\" can testify. Those who sounded the alarms were seen as killjoys who refused to join the party. Words are important, but clearly they are not enough. We need strong policies to back them up. We need macroprudential policymakers ready to take away the punch bowl when the party is getting out of hand. We know that market participants won't take kindly when limits are set precisely in those markets that are most exuberant, the ones in which they are making big money. During the late stages of the housing boom, more than a few financial institution chief executive officers dismissed the warnings of their own risk managers with a wave of the hand.\n\nSo what should be the main tools of macroprudential supervision? Many of them are similar to those of microprudential policy. They take the form of restrictions or incentives related to financial firms' balance sheets. Still, macroprudential policies differ from purely microprudential approaches in that they are intended to protect the financial system as a whole and, by extension, the broader economy. Macroprudential policies will be aimed at countering the pro-cyclical nature of credit and leverage, leaning against the wind when systemic risk is accumulating. In addition, they will seek to stem risks related to interconnections and spillovers in the financial system.\n\nThe Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is playing a key role in designing this new regulatory regime as part of the Basel III initiative. And, under Federal Reserve leadership, initiatives to implement macroprudential supervision are well under way in the United States. Policymakers here and abroad agree that macroprudential policy must include requirements to hold more and higher-quality capital. And capital requirements must be reformulated to reduce the pro-cyclicality of credit and leverage. Financial institutions may be required to build capital buffers in good times, which they can run down in bad times, thereby limiting credit growth during booms and mitigating credit contraction in downturns. Banks may also be required to have, in addition to their standard equity buffers, contingent capital in the form of debt that is convertible to equity if they experience significant losses. This additional capital would protect them from insolvency during busts while allowing them to benefit from debt finance in boom times. U.S. regulators have also been charged with developing heightened prudential standards for systemically important institutions to constrain risk-taking by those firms whose failures would pose the greatest systemic risk. One approach could involve imposing penalties or restrictions on financial firms based on factors such as the correlation of their strategies with those of other firms or by limiting risk exposure to individual counterparties.\n\nPolicies are on the drawing board to ensure that institutions avoid undue reliance on short-term debt and have adequate liquidity in market downturns. Such requirements would diminish the risk of the shortfalls and hoarding that could fuel a credit market meltdown. Policymakers might additionally put in place policies to discourage overreliance on short-term debt among investors more broadly through, for example, regulations on repo haircuts. To address unsustainable real estate price run-ups, some countries have chosen to cap maximum loan-to-value ratios on home loans. Such an approach deserves serious consideration. My expectation is that policies such as these will restrict dangerous pro-cyclical movements in debt and leverage, diminish the extent of maturity mismatches and the potential for runs, and discourage unsustainable asset price appreciation. Importantly, the Federal Reserve and other U.S. regulators have also taken steps to ensure that the financial institutions we supervise enforce compensation policies that control incentives for excessive pro-cyclical risk-taking.\n\nMacroprudential supervision must be particularly attentive to risks that could impair the plumbing of the financial system--that is, the payments, clearing, and settlements systems--where breakdowns would relay and amplify systemic risk. Importantly, the Dodd-Frank Act significantly increases the trading of derivatives on exchanges and their clearing through central counterparties. 10 Because clearinghouses are themselves subject to risk from counterparties and are important linchpins in the financial system, they must be regulated to ensure that they operate safely.\n\nSince the implementation of macroprudential supervision is a work in progress, I want to highlight several important design considerations. The first relates to the appropriate balance between fixed rules and discretion--a question familiar from monetary and fiscal policy. In both cases, we have learned that fixed rules offer distinct advantages. In fiscal policy, automatic stabilizers have proven helpful in mitigating the amplitude of cyclical fluctuations. They trigger fiscal support when needed in a timely and predictable way. In the realm of monetary policy, the Fed and other central banks commonly vary policy in a manner that researchers and market participants find predictable and systematic. Indeed, guidance from policy rules is increasingly used in actual decisionmaking since rule-based recommendations create a sensible starting point for deliberations. Rule-like behavior also aligns the expectations of markets and policymakers so that policy is transmitted quickly and effectively to the economy.\n\nNevertheless, neither fiscal nor monetary policymakers rely on fixed rules alone. Discretionary fiscal policy has been helpful, even essential, in some instances in responding to economic fluctuations resulting from large shocks. Similarly, in the realm of monetary policy, the Fed and other central banks certainly don't slavishly follow prescriptions from any rule. They retain discretion to deviate from such prescriptions when responding to severe shocks, unusually strong headwinds, or significant asymmetric risks.\n\nIn the implementation of macroprudential supervision, I believe it will be similarly advantageous to put in place a system of controls in which fixed rules play an important role while a place is preserved for the discretionary judgments of regulators. Fixed rules will diminish the need for policymakers to make the difficult decision to take away the punch bowl. Moreover, if discretionary macroprudential policy interventions are deferred until a boom is well under way, the macroeconomic spillovers could prove difficult for monetary policy to offset.\n\nFor these reasons, a stronger system of prudential controls designed to mitigate the buildup of systemic risk must be put into place, a system that will incorporate mechanisms to automatically counter pro-cyclical behavior. All the same, discretionary interventions will inevitably play a part in macroprudential supervision. For one thing, it's important to keep in mind that financial institutions have been very adept at gaming rule-based systems. And, over time, there is always an incentive for risky financial activities to migrate outside the perimeter of supervision and regulation, even if that perimeter is moving. That's precisely what happened prior to the mortgage crisis, when leverage ballooned in the shadow banking system and investment banks and some nonbanks became principal participants in credit derivatives markets. Furthermore, the financial system will evolve in ways that preclude any wholly rule-based system from countering all emerging systemic threats. Discretionary macroprudential interventions are certain to be needed to address dangerous developments, and judgment must play a role.\n\nA second consideration in macroprudential supervision relates to the need for robust policies. This concern derives from the observation that we still have a lot to learn about the behavior of financial institutions and their effects on systemic risk and the real economy. Our ability to model the channels by which disruptions in credit and finance affect the real economy and the ways these effects feed back into the banking and financial systems is getting more sophisticated. 11 But our understanding of the key channels, their quantitative importance, and the effects of our policies remain incomplete at best. It is therefore important that we implement policies that are likely to succeed in mitigating systemic risk in a future crisis regardless of the precise triggers and transmission channels. A rich monetary policy literature demonstrates that simple rules result in good, even excellent, performance when policymakers face uncertainty about the structure of the economy and the source of economic shocks. 12 This conclusion may apply to macroprudential supervision as well.\n\nA third consideration in the design of the macroprudential supervision relates to the need for extensive international cooperation. If the United States were to go it alone with tough policies, we could see our financial institutions flee in a race to the bottom. But I'm convinced that won't happen. We are working closely with our international counterparts to develop coherent and comprehensive approaches, aided by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Financial Stability Board, the International Monetary Fund, and other institutions. 13\n\nFinally, we must not forget that macroprudential policies will entail some costs as well as benefits. The magnitude of these costs remains a subject of debate. But, as with all forms of regulation, we must find the right balance between overly strict supervision and laissez faire. I don't know exactly where on the continuum that balance lies. But I do know that, before the crisis, we had veered disastrously too far in the direction of laissez faire, with consequences we know too well.\n\nInteraction with Monetary Policy One of the most challenging issues relating to systemic risk management is the appropriate interactions between macroprudential and monetary policy. To what extent, if at all, should monetary policy be used to mitigate systemic risk? And to what extent, if at all, should monetary policy be coordinated with macroprudential supervision? These issues are the subject of intense debate among policymakers across the globe. Of course, the question of whether monetary policy should lean against asset price bubbles is hardly new. 14 What has changed is the sense of urgency surrounding this and related questions.\n\nI noted previously--and it is now commonly accepted--that monetary policy can affect systemic risk through a number of channels. 15 First, monetary policy has a direct effect on asset prices for the obvious reason that interest rates represent the opportunity costs of holding assets. Indeed, an important element of the monetary transmission mechanism works through the asset price channel. In theory, an increase in asset prices induced by a decline in interest rates should not cause asset prices to keep escalating in bubble-like fashion. But if bubbles do develop, perhaps because of an onset of excessive optimism, and especially if the bubble is financed by debt, the result may be a buildup of systemic risk. Second, recent research has identified possible linkages between monetary policy and leverage among financial intermediaries. 16 It is conceivable that accommodative monetary policy could provide tinder for a buildup of leverage and excessive risk-taking in the financial system.\n\nMacroprudential interventions may also have macroeconomic spillovers. For example, research suggests that rigorous enforcement of supervisory standards for capital following the real estate-related loan losses of the early 1990s may have slowed the economy's recovery from the recession. Today, we all understand the need for more stringent bank capital and liquidity requirements to stem systemic risk. But, with high unemployment in so many economies, the new Basel III agreement recognizes the desirability of a phase in period for these standards. The implementation of tighter standards over a multi-year period should mitigate the concern that the macroprudential policies we are putting in place to control systemic risk will unduly restrict the availability of credit, thereby retarding economic recovery. In this case, as it should, the implementation of macroprudential policy is taking account of spillovers that monetary policy, at least now, cannot easily offset.\n\nSome would argue that the conduct of macroprudential and monetary policy should be closely coordinated, even integrated, because of the spillovers I described. 17 Indeed, the logic of this argument has led some observers to conclude that both macroprudential and monetary policy should be assigned to the central bank. 18 As I noted, the Dodd-Frank Act assigned the Federal Reserve an important role in the conduct of macroprudential supervision, and for good reasons. We have long experience in supervision, broad knowledge of financial markets, and an understanding of the linkages between financial markets and the economy. In addition, the insights derived from our supervisory role benefit the conduct of monetary policy. But the pursuit of macroprudential supervision under the new legislation involves other regulatory agencies beside the Fed, and the new Financial Stability Oversight Council will play an important role. And, of course, the Fed will keep sole responsibility for the conduct of monetary policy, retaining its independence. There are important reasons for this approach. One is that systemic risk surveillance will benefit from the perspectives of regulators with different windows on the financial system, all participating in the oversight council. Second, the principle of central bank independence in the conduct of monetary policy is widely accepted as vital to achieving maximum employment and price stability.\n\nFortunately, it is perfectly possible to attain good outcomes even if monetary policy and macroprudential policy are carried out separately and independently, and the goals of each are pursued using entirely separate tool kits. This conclusion is an application of the assignment problem made familiar by Robert Mundell and others who analyzed monetary and fiscal policy. 19 A key insight from that literature is that satisfactory results can be attained without policy coordination, even though fully optimal policy generally calls for coordination when spillovers occur. Of course, it is necessary for monetary policy to take into account any macroeconomic effects resulting from macroprudential policy and vice versa.\n\nThis separate-assignments approach to formulating macroprudential and monetary policy has merit both in theory and practice. But I want to be careful not to push the argument for separation too far. I noted, for example, that situations may arise in which the Federal Reserve, in its conduct of monetary policy, might not be able to fully offset the macroeconomic effects of macroprudential interventions. This scenario could happen because of the zero bound on interest rates or monetary policy lags. In such circumstances, it makes sense for macroprudential policy to take macroeconomic effects into account. By the same token, I would not want to argue that it is never appropriate for monetary policy to take into account its potential effect on financial stability. Regulation is imperfect. Financial imbalances may emerge even if we strengthen macroprudential oversight and control. Some day in the future, it is possible that macroprudential regulators might let down their guard. In such situations, if emerging threats to financial stability become evident, monetary policy could be faced with difficult tradeoffs. My hope is that such situations will remain largely theoretical and, in practice, be exceedingly rare.\n\nOverall, I am encouraged by the progress we are making in developing the new regulatory framework. Still, macroprudential supervision is a work in progress, and we must humbly recognize that we have a lot to learn.\n\nChallenges It's important to be realistic about the challenges that lie ahead. By its nature, policy designed to manage systemic risk fights dangers that may never lead to crises. We may sometimes be like the boy who cried, \"Wolf!\"--and the villagers may not be pleased about being rousted from their beds. Right now, we are still suffering from the shock of an epic financial disaster. The climate for macroprudential policymaking is relatively favorable. But memories will fade, as they always have before, and future policymakers may face harsh criticism. They will need to make difficult and potentially costly judgment calls, relying on imperfect real-time information. In this regard, it's worth recalling Paul Samuelson's quip that the stock market has predicted nine of the past five recessions. Will future regulators and monetary policymakers be accused of bursting 10 of the past 2 asset bubbles?\n\nThese dangers are real. But the events we've recently lived through make it clear that we have no choice but to embark on this road. We've all been asked, \"Didn't you see this mortgage disaster coming? Why didn't you do anything about it?\" Our task now is to implement intelligent policies to contain future bubbles and credit binges, and to make sure that those that do occur inflict a lot less damage on the economy. Next time I hope we can say, \"We did see it coming, and we did something about it.\"\n\nThank you very much.\n\n1.
