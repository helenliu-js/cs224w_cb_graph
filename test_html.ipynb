      "In a recent speech 1 I talked about a number of the challenges facing the economy as we seek to secure the recovery and build for the future. Today I will focus on one of these: the problems in the U.S. housing market. In focusing today on housing, I would emphasize that this is only one factor behind the frustratingly slow economic recovery. Nevertheless, it is an important one that deserves our attention. As always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\n",
      "\n",
      "The New York Fed is deeply committed to contributing to efforts to resolve the housing crisis that still afflicts our nation. Our economists monitor the housing market and analyze its impact on the national economy. My outreach staff work with community groups and housing practitioners to support local programs that aid distressed homeowners. Our lawyers perform pro-bono work for homeowners facing foreclosure and advise on legal reforms, while our researchers and market analysts have developed proposals to mitigate current problems and improve the future structure of housing finance.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my presentation today, I will explain why a more robust housing market matters for the wider economy. I will also highlight those factors specific to the housing market that create a risk that it will linger in an extremely weak state for longer than is necessary and remain vulnerable to further weakness.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will make the case for further housing-related policy interventions that would help stabilize home prices, improve the housing outlook and generate an earlier recovery in housing activity. I believe such actions would support growth and make monetary policy more effective in promoting the dual mandate given to the Federal Reserve by Congress—maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Housing Bust Given the excesses of the housing boom that took place in the early to middle part of the last decade, a substantial downward adjustment in housing was unavoidable. Since peaking in the second quarter of 2006, home prices have fallen by about 30 percent, 2 returning to levels that last prevailed in mid-2003. In the states of Arizona, California, Florida and Nevada, where home prices rose much more than the national average, prices have declined by roughly 40 percent. Over the past year, house prices have declined by another 4 percent, though they remained roughly flat, when one excludes distress sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "Home construction collapsed with new single family starts falling from a peak rate of 1.75 million homes per year to a low of 360,000 in early 2009. After a very slight pick-up, they have been bumping along at about a 425,000 annual rate for over a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the number of mortgages becoming delinquent is off its peak, it remains very elevated and increased in the third quarter of 2011. 3 According to the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, at the end of that quarter there were roughly 1.5 million first lien mortgages 90 or more days past due, and 2 million first lien mortgages in some stage of foreclosure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over time, without an improvement in housing and the labor market, more loans will become seriously delinquent. Moreover, absent more aggressive efforts to find economically efficient alternatives to foreclosure — loans already seriously delinquent and in foreclosure will become real estate owned by the lender, or REO. My staff estimate that the flow of properties into lender REO in 2012 and 2013 could be as high as 1.8 million per year, up from around 1.1 million in 2011 and around 600,000 in 2010.\n",
      "\n",
      "The overhang of properties in the foreclosure/REO pipeline continues to exert downward pressure on house prices and housing activity. Recent surveys by MacroMarkets and by Fannie Mae indicate that households expect negligible gains in home prices over the next few years, with many expecting that prices will continue to decline.\n",
      "\n",
      "Macroeconomic Consequences The ongoing weakness in housing has made it more difficult to achieve a vigorous economic recovery. Housing has inhibited economic activity through a number of channels.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the strong rebound in residential investment that typically powers economic recoveries following deep recessions has been absent. For example, nine quarters following the ends of the mid-1970s and early 1980s recessions, residential investment had climbed by 65 percent and 55 percent, respectively, above the level at the corresponding troughs. In contrast, during this cycle, there has been no rebound. In the third quarter of 2011, residential investment was still somewhat below the level in the second quarter of 2009.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, by eroding household wealth, the decline in housing prices has contributed to greater weakness in consumption. For most American households the family home is by far the largest tangible asset, a buffer against misfortune, and often a significant savings vehicle to fund retirement. 4\n",
      "\n",
      "Since home values peaked in 2006, homeowners have lost more than half their home equity—about $7.3 trillion—and expectations of future gains have also declined. At present roughly 11 million households are in negative equity with the aggregate amount of negative equity estimated to be roughly $700 billion. 5\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, the weakness in home prices has reduced credit availability. Because the home is the primary source of collateral for most households, financial institutions are less willing to lend when house prices have declined substantially and could fall further. In addition, problems in the foreclosure process and obstacles to efficient modification of loans in securitizations, which I'll describe in a moment, make a house of a given value less attractive as collateral to secure a loan. As a result, as home prices have fallen, financial institutions have tightened lending standards. This has reduced the amount of credit available for households, including for small business formation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth, the big drop in house prices has made it more difficult for borrowers to refinance. This has undercut to a degree the ability of monetary policy to support demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Traditionally, refinancing activity has been an important channel through which lower interest rates support spending and employment. Refinancing frees up borrower income. Because those who refinance tend to have a higher marginal propensity to consume from income than the investors receiving the mortgage payments, such refinancing activity increases overall demand. However, the fall in home equity combined with a pro-cyclical tightening of refinancing standards and fees means that many borrowers who would like to refinance cannot do so. Problems in Housing By many measures—including affordability ratios and price-to-rent ratios—home prices have fallen back to or below their pre-boom levels. Indeed, housing no longer appears overvalued. In many former boom localities, the price of existing homes has fallen below the cost of building a new home. 6 Also, after several years of depressed construction the national stock of housing no longer looks excessive relative to the nation's population.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, housing currently remains in excess supply, in part, because household formation rates remain depressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Normally, when there is excess supply, markets self-correct fairly efficiently. Prices fall until they reach a level at which supply and demand are balanced. Unfortunately, the housing market has a number of specific features that complicate this adjustment process and mean it could undershoot — and remain weaker for longer than is necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Housing is a very long-lived asset. Once new building ceases in stressed markets, further reductions in demand cannot be matched by further supply reductions. 7 This means that the market clearing price for housing is highly sensitive to those factors that influence demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, there is a feedback loop from prices to demand, with weaker prices leading to weaker demand. If house prices are anticipated to increase, then the expected capital gain helps to offset the financing cost of owning a home. However, if households believe that house prices could decline further, the expected capital loss adds to the financing cost of owning a home and prospective buyers will be reluctant to buy even if mortgage rates are low.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, it should also be recognized that the factors that affect demand and home prices are not immutable. They depend, in part, on policy choices. Consider, for example, the fact that most home purchases are financed with long-term mortgage credit. This means that the demand for housing is highly sensitive to the availability and cost of that credit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outcomes in housing are also affected by the legal and operational infrastructure of the mortgage market. This apparatus has been wholly inadequate for dealing with a systemic shock to housing and employment, and is amplifying bad outcomes. A flawed resolution regime—very different from the more efficient regime for resolving excess debt in private commercial property—exacerbates the risks of under-shooting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conflicts of interest are embedded in mortgage securitization structures and between first and second lien-holders. There are challenges to how the industry records and transfers interests in these mortgages. For mortgages that are part of securitizations, the legal obstacles to loan modification that preserve value are substantial. Meanwhile, mortgage servicers lack the systems, processes, governance, resources and incentives to deal effectively with a large volume of delinquent borrowers—who often suffer poor customer treatment at a time of personal distress. 8\n",
      "\n",
      "The result is inefficiently low levels of mortgage modification, too few \"short sales\" 9 by mutual agreement between distressed borrowers and lenders, and too much reliance on the foreclosure process. This process also has many legal impediments and has become even more inefficient as the volume of loans in the pipeline increases. One consequence has been lengthening delays in completing foreclosures—including unavoidable foreclosures. These delays have increased the economic damage caused by foreclosure and reduced recovery rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "The damage caused by inefficient foreclosures is worth emphasizing. It is not just the direct loss of value in terms of deterioration of homes that are ultimately foreclosed. In addition, as I have personally witnessed in my outreach visits across the New York Fed's District, foreclosures impose significant costs on families, surrounding neighborhoods and communities. Unmaintained homes facing foreclosure drag down the value of nearby homes. Also, property taxes on non-foreclosed homes often go up due to a declining tax base and this puts additional downward pressure on housing prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Foreclosures also undercut housing demand. Households that go through foreclosure need to repair their credit records and to accumulate new downpayments. For several years they are no longer available as potential home buyers and this also contributes to softer demand and weaker housing prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further declines in home prices also could be reinforcing because they would likely make the already daunting foreclosure/REO pipeline even larger. Currently, households in negative equity or \"underwater\" on their loans owe $65,000 on average more on their mortgages than the value of their homes. Since the recession, most defaults have been by necessity — that is, they have been prompted by a job loss, health problems or divorce coupled with the household being in negative equity. No doubt, however, there is some degree or duration of negative equity that may cause households to conclude that a default is inevitable and should be taken sooner rather than later. If this point were reached, defaults by choice could significantly swell the flow of homes into the foreclosure pipeline.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Case for Housing Intervention All these factors imply that there are many potential equilibrium outcomes in terms of housing demand and home prices—some considerably more desirable than others. Negative price expectations and flawed financing and administrative mechanisms, if left unaddressed, can contribute to ongoing weakness in housing demand and make it harder to generate a robust economic recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Persistent weakness in housing is particularly problematic because it acts as a drag on spending and job creation in an environment in which such weakness can not be easily offset by other policy adjustments. Housing policy should seek to break adverse feedback loops, promote more economically efficient outcomes in housing and support growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent speeches, 10 I have called for a \"comprehensive approach\" to stabilize the national real estate market and lay the foundations for recovery. I believe this should include measures to improve access to mortgage credit, reduce obstacles to refinancing, lessen the flow of homes into foreclosure through bridge financing and accelerated principal reduction, and to facilitate the absorption of REO back into use as owner- or renter- housing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of these policies simply seek to solve or bypass the legal and incentive problems in the market today and mimic efficient private actions that might be taken if mortgage loans were all held in portfolio and accounting rules did not discourage net present value maximization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Others seek to solve coordination problems and take account of the externalities or spillovers to generate outcomes that are superior from the broadest perspective of the nation as a whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier this week Chairman Bernanke sent members of Congress a thoughtful analysis of housing policy 11 by staff at the Board of Governors in Washington that evaluates a number of these same issues. What I would like to do today is to elaborate on some specific proposals we have developed in New York, in order to try to persuade you that there are workable solutions to our housing problems at costs that I deem very reasonable relative to the economically inefficient path we are on. Of course, I am open to other promising alternatives that would address the same issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "I note also that a truly comprehensive approach would also include long-term reform —including reform of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac—to put housing finance on a more stable footing and to equip the market to deal more effectively with any future systemic shocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I will not discuss these issues in-depth today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Access to Mortgage Credit Restoring demand for housing requires new mortgage debt to be offered to creditworthy borrowers on reasonable terms. This is important because residential mortgage lending terms tightened significantly during the crisis, and have not eased subsequently. 12\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, over 50 percent of all new loans—and 70 percent of new prime conforming loans—go to borrowers with FICO scores of 760 or above, compared with about 30 percent before the crisis. Borrowers with credit scores of 720 or less now make up less than 30 percent of new originations, although they represent 52 percent of the population with credit scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "Steps should be taken to improve households' access to credit. Currently, lenders are discouraged from making new prime conforming loans due to excessively stringent put-back rules on these mortgages. Such rules give Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac broad scope to force the originator to repurchase at par loans that go delinquent if there are any errors in the mortgage loan paperwork—even if the error has no direct link to the delinquency.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is essential that lenders are accountable for the representations they make and are appropriately penalized for any misrepresentations. However, doing this via a blanket repurchase regime leads to bad outcomes at a time when there is an unusually high risk of job loss leading to delinquency. It would be better to establish alternative ways to penalize lenders for misrepresentation that were not in practice so closely tied to the risk of job loss. 13\n",
      "\n",
      "The current repurchase regime exposes lenders originating prime conforming loans to significant credit risk and encourages them to focus only on the lowest-risk customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lenders are applying tougher restrictions than the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac formally require in order to limit the risk that they will have to take back such loans when they become delinquent.\n",
      "\n",
      "For mortgages guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a better balance between incentives for sound underwriting and credit availability could be achieved by inserting a materiality test in the rep and warranty agreement.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the future, it would be worth exploring whether a better regime in general would be to have representations and warranties with a finite duration, but supplemented by a rigorous quality control check of the underwiting based on a random sample of the mortgages as they are being securitized. 14\n",
      "\n",
      "Today's tough underwriting standards and high risk-based premiums for conforming loan borrowers should also be reviewed. I do not want to see a return to the lax standards and underpricing of credit risk of the boom period. But the guarantee fees for new purchase mortgages should be based on the expected losses on these mortgages—not the realized losses on loans of earlier vintages.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is also a strong case for tackling the downward bias on appraisals, which are voiding many transactions between willing buyers and willing sellers. Incentives for individual appraisers favor conservatism today—just as they favored over-optimism during the boom.\n",
      "\n",
      "This problem is aggravated by the difficulty in establishing benchmark prices in markets with few transactions and a high share of distress sales. The industry could establish appraisal standards that avoid such procylical outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mortgage Refinancing Increasing refinancing would support the housing market by promoting aggregate demand and employment. Refinancing creates additional cash flow for borrowers to absorb any adverse income shocks and this reduces the likelihood of default, distress sales and foreclosures.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there are significant obstacles to refinancing in current circumstances. Declines in home equity have been aggravated by tighter standards, high refinancing fees, burdensome administrative processes, and legal risks to the lenders refinancing the loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because the taxpayer, via Fannie and Freddie, is already exposed to the risk of conforming loans defaulting, it makes no sense to make it expensive or difficult for borrowers with these loans to refinance. After all, refinancing reduces the credit risk to which taxpayers are exposed. It is also inefficient to fully re-underwrite applications for such refinancings. For example, appraisals could be greatly simplified and made less expensive by using automated valuation models.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Home Affordable Refinance Program, or HARP, was set up to facilitate refinancing of high loan-to-value prime conforming mortgages. The announced goal of the HARP was to refinance 3 million to 4 million mortgages. However, shortcomings with the original program mean that less than a million HARP refinancings have taken place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Legal risks discouraged lenders from participating more fully in HARP to date. Notably, if a lender refinanced a loan made by another company, it was liable for the underwriting associated with the original loan. The profit from refinancing was unattractive relative to the risk of being forced to repurchase the loan. Given this, lenders had little incentive to compete to refinance loans and this led to higher mortgage rates and less refinancing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of these issues have been addressed by recent revisions to HARP and related decisions by Fannie Mae, but more could and should be done. Remaining legal issues could be alleviated by harmonizing standards between Fannie and Freddie.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would like to see refinancing made broadly available on streamlined terms and with moderate fees to all prime conforming borrowers who are current on their payments. This could substantially increase the number of refinancings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bridge Financing To stabilize the housing market, we also need to weaken the link between unemployment and new foreclosures. The primary reason for distress sales and mortgage defaults today is the loss of a job. Even if it were possible, it would be inefficient for homeowners with mortgages to self-insure against a job loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some support for unemployed homeowners has been provided in some states under the Hardest Hit program. I favor a broad program to provide bridge financing for all qualified borrowers with demonstrated ability to service their debts who become unemployed involuntarily—though categorically not those who quit or are terminated with cause. In economic terms, this is a form of collective insurance. 15\n",
      "\n",
      "My staff estimates that there are 4 million to 5 million \"at risk\" homeowners who can afford their mortgage, but who would struggle to make their payments in the event that the primary earner in the household became unemployed.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the current weak labor markets, they estimate around 600,000 of these at-risk households will experience an involuntary job loss that lasts longer than a month over the next year. The average annual amount that would be required to keep the mortgage current for these households while unemployed and receiving unemployment insurance is around $21,000. This would be a loan not a grant. 16\n",
      "\n",
      "This implies an annual bridge lending program of $15 billion per year during the current stress period. This seems expensive, but this is not the cost of such a program, just the cash outlay in the early years. In the future, loan repayments would help to offset the program cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, when one factors in the reduced negative externalities achieved by limiting distress sales, the expected program cost would be even lower.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, any bridge financing loans would need to be properly secured in order to protect taxpayers interests. In situations in which the value of the loan already exceeded the value of the home, it might be appropriate to require lenders to write down the excess debt as a condition for the borrower obtaining a bridge loan. This would ensure that the bridging funds did not \"bail out\" the lender. Writing down excess debt would likely be in the lender's rational self-interest given the borrower's situation, since a distress sale or foreclosure at current market prices would generally yield larger losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Earned Principal Reduction Investment firms that purchase delinquent mortgages routinely reduce principal in order to maximize value on these loans. It would make sense for Fannie and Freddie to do this as well in order to minimize loss of value on the delinquent loans they guarantee.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I am uncomfortable with the notion that \"underwater\" borrowers who owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth should have to go delinquent before they have a chance of securing a reduction in their mortgage debt. I believe we should also develop a program for earned principal reduction for borrowers who are underwater but keep on making their mortgage payments. Such a program would strengthen the incentives for mortgage holders who are underwater to continue to stay current on their loans, and reduce the likely number of defaults and REO sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "Negative equity is one of the most significant predictors of mortgage default across all types of mortgage products, including when you control for credit scores and level of income documentation. While recent underwater borrowers have not been defaulting at a rapid pace, they are also not prepaying, implying that underwater mortgages remain \"at risk\" for a prolonged period of time to any adverse shock to the borrower.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is admittedly challenging to predict how underwater borrowers will ultimately perform and this performance will be sensitive to the path of home prices. Nonetheless, analysis by my staff that looks at likely borrower behavior over an extended time horizon suggests that without a significant turnaround in home prices and employment, a substantial proportion of those loans that are deeply underwater will ultimately default — absent an earned principal reduction program.\n",
      "\n",
      "One option developed by my staff is for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to give underwater borrowers on loans that they have guaranteed the right to pay off the loan at below par in the future under certain circumstances, including that the borrowers have continued to make timely payments. For instance, the borrower could be given an open-ended option to pay off the loan at an LTV of 125 percent, and the right to pay off the loan at an LTV of 95 percent after three years of timely payments.\n",
      "\n",
      "The borrower would be protected from further declines in home prices, but in return would give up a portion of any upside from future capital gains on the home via a shared appreciation agreement. Note that under this arrangement some of the reduction in the loan amount would be paid by the borrower as the outstanding balance was amortized by continued monthly payments.\n",
      "\n",
      "REO Portfolio Even with aggressive policies to minimize the flow of loans into foreclosure, my staff estimates that large volumes of properties would still flow into lenders' REO over the next few years. This growing overhang could continue to depress prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, along with more incentives to promote short sales, steps should be taken to facilitate the timely and orderly absorption of these properties back into the market including as renter-occupied housing. An interagency group including the Federal Reserve is working on issues relating to REO-to-rental conversions. Appropriate policies would simultaneously lessen downward pressure on home prices and upward pressure on rents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among other steps, investors could be encouraged to purchase REO to be made available as rental housing. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could increase the number of loans offered to individual investors, provided the investor puts up an adequate amount of equity for each mortgage. And REO properties in a given locality could be bundled for sale.\n",
      "\n",
      "The government might consider a package of tax incentives for purchases of REO that are used as rental properties. Such incentives might include a reduction of the current 27½ year depreciation period and/or a reduction of capital gains tax liability if the property is held for a minimum period, such as five years.\n",
      "\n",
      "One idea developed by my staff—let's call it \"homes for heros\"—would be to create a new tax credit or other home purchase subsidy specifically for veterans of our foreign wars that would enable these veterans to purchase such properties at a discount. There are over 2½ million Gulf War II veterans alone, many of whom served multiple tours of duty overseas, and a significant proportion of them might otherwise not be able to purchase homes today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our nation owes them a great debt, and such a policy would provide a boost to housing demand quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moral Hazard Some argue that any interventions to improve the real estate market would lead to moral hazard—that is these intervention would reward bad behaviors. I think these concerns are overstated. First, the programs that have been proposed can be designed with the proper incentives to limit moral hazard and to encourage desireable behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, in contrast to the earlier phase of housing crisis when mostly subprime borrowers came under stress, many of the borrowers running into trouble with their mortgages today took out conforming loans subject to standard downpayment requirements, had respectable FICO scores and borrowed a moderate amount to finance an average house. The problem was that these purchases occurred near the peak in the market and now many of the buyers have suffered an adverse life shock such as unemployment or illness. This isn't a moral hazard issue, this is just the bad luck associated with the timing of the purchase and an exceptionally weak jobs market. Punishing such misfortune accomplishes little.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Taxpayer Interest I believe that the proposals I put forward are strongly in the public interest. I also believe that they would be good for taxpayers. Consider, for instance, the proposal for earned principal reduction. While this would certainly involve outlays, these would be offset by reduced defaults. Whether there is a net cost or not depends on the reduction in the default rate that would come with principal reduction and how this reduction would affect the performance of the overall housing market and the economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on recent data on borrower behavior, 17 my staff calculates that the taxpayer (through the effect on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) would be better off with earned principal reduction under a base case of roughly flat house prices and persistent weakness in the jobs market. Under a scenario of modest house price increases, the combination of fewer defaults and shared appreciation also produces a net benefit.\n",
      "\n",
      "This result occurs before taking into account the positive externalities of nudging house prices onto a stronger path, which would reduce the magnitude of losses on loans that do default. On an expected value basis, such a program appears still more compelling, since Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are currently exposed to the downside risk of further declines in home prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, just focusing on the impact on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is much too narrow even from a taxpayer perspective. If you believe as I do that improving the outlook for housing would materially strengthen the over economy, one must also include the fiscal benefits generated by stronger economic growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Housing Policy and Monetary Policy In closing, the housing policy agenda I describe would address one factor that has impeded the economic recovery. Implementing such policies would improve the economic outlook and make monetary accommodation more effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, because the outlook for unemployment is unacceptably high relative to our dual mandate and the outlook for inflation is moderate, I believe it is also appropriate to continue to evaluate whether we could provide additional accommodation in a manner that produces more benefits than costs, regardless of whether action in housing is undertaken or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Monetary policy and housing policy are much more complements than substitutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I hope I have convinced you today, while the Fed has will do all it can to achieve our dual mandate of maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability, we have to recognize that there is more to economic policy than just monetary policy. Low interest rates help housing, but cannot resolve the problems in that sector that are pressing on wider economic activity. With additional housing policy interventions, we could achieve a better set of economic outcomes than with just monetary policy alone.\n",

      "At âStructural Shifts in the Global Economy,â an economic policy symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Jackson Hole, Wyoming\n",
      "\n",
      "Good morning. At last year's Jackson Hole symposium, I delivered a brief, direct message. My remarks this year will be a bit longer, but the message is the same: It is the Fed's job to bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal, and we will do so. We have tightened policy significantly over the past year. Although inflation has moved down from its peakâa welcome developmentâit remains too high. We are prepared to raise rates further if appropriate, and intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we are confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward our objective.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today I will review our progress so far and discuss the outlook and the uncertainties we face as we pursue our dual mandate goals. I will conclude with a summary of what this means for policy. Given how far we have come, at upcoming meetings we are in a position to proceed carefully as we assess the incoming data and the evolving outlook and risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Decline in Inflation So Far The ongoing episode of high inflation initially emerged from a collision between very strong demand and pandemic-constrained supply. By the time the Federal Open Market Committee raised the policy rate in March 2022, it was clear that bringing down inflation would depend on both the unwinding of the unprecedented pandemic-related demand and supply distortions and on our tightening of monetary policy, which would slow the growth of aggregate demand, allowing supply time to catch up. While these two forces are now working together to bring down inflation, the process still has a long way to go, even with the more favorable recent readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a 12-month basis, U.S. total, or \"headline,\" PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation peaked at 7 percent in June 2022 and declined to 3.3 percent as of July, following a trajectory roughly in line with global trends ( figure 1, panel A ). 1 The effects of Russia's war against Ukraine have been a primary driver of the changes in headline inflation around the world since early 2022. Headline inflation is what households and businesses experience most directly, so this decline is very good news. But food and energy prices are influenced by global factors that remain volatile, and can provide a misleading signal of where inflation is headed. In my remaining comments, I will focus on core PCE inflation, which omits the food and energy components.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a 12-month basis, core PCE inflation peaked at 5.4 percent in February 2022 and declined gradually to 4.3 percent in July (figure 1, panel B). The lower monthly readings for core inflation in June and July were welcome, but two months of good data are only the beginning of what it will take to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal. We can't yet know the extent to which these lower readings will continue or where underlying inflation will settle over coming quarters. Twelve-month core inflation is still elevated, and there is substantial further ground to cover to get back to price stability.\n",
      "\n",
      "To understand the factors that will likely drive further progress, it is useful to separately examine the three broad components of core PCE inflationâinflation for goods, for housing services, and for all other services, sometimes referred to as nonhousing services ( figure 2 ).\n",
      "\n",
      "Core goods inflation has fallen sharply, particularly for durable goods, as both tighter monetary policy and the slow unwinding of supply and demand dislocations are bringing it down. The motor vehicle sector provides a good illustration. Earlier in the pandemic, demand for vehicles rose sharply, supported by low interest rates, fiscal transfers, curtailed spending on in-person services, and shifts in preference away from using public transportation and from living in cities. But because of a shortage of semiconductors, vehicle supply actually fell. Vehicle prices spiked, and a large pool of pent-up demand emerged. As the pandemic and its effects have waned, production and inventories have grown, and supply has improved. At the same time, higher interest rates have weighed on demand. Interest rates on auto loans have nearly doubled since early last year, and customers report feeling the effect of higher rates on affordability. 2 On net, motor vehicle inflation has declined sharply because of the combined effects of these supply and demand factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similar dynamics are playing out for core goods inflation overall. As they do, the effects of monetary restraint should show through more fully over time. Core goods prices fell the past two months, but on a 12-month basis, core goods inflation remains well above its pre-pandemic level. Sustained progress is needed, and restrictive monetary policy is called for to achieve that progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the highly interest-sensitive housing sector, the effects of monetary policy became apparent soon after liftoff. Mortgage rates doubled over the course of 2022, causing housing starts and sales to fall and house price growth to plummet. Growth in market rents soon peaked and then steadily declined ( figure 3 ). 3\n",
      "\n",
      "Measured housing services inflation lagged these changes, as is typical, but has recently begun to fall. This inflation metric reflects rents paid by all tenants, as well as estimates of the equivalent rents that could be earned from homes that are owner occupied. 4 Because leases turn over slowly, it takes time for a decline in market rent growth to work its way into the overall inflation measure. The market rent slowdown has only recently begun to show through to that measure. The slowing growth in rents for new leases over roughly the past year can be thought of as \"in the pipeline\" and will affect measured housing services inflation over the coming year. Going forward, if market rent growth settles near pre-pandemic levels, housing services inflation should decline toward its pre-pandemic level as well. We will continue to watch the market rent data closely for a signal of the upside and downside risks to housing services inflation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The final category, nonhousing services, accounts for over half of the core PCE index and includes a broad range of services, such as health care, food services, transportation, and accommodations. Twelve-month inflation in this sector has moved sideways since liftoff. Inflation measured over the past three and six months has declined, however, which is encouraging. Part of the reason for the modest decline of nonhousing services inflation so far is that many of these services were less affected by global supply chain bottlenecks and are generally thought to be less interest sensitive than other sectors such as housing or durable goods. Production of these services is also relatively labor intensive, and the labor market remains tight. Given the size of this sector, some further progress here will be essential to restoring price stability. Over time, restrictive monetary policy will help bring aggregate supply and demand back into better balance, reducing inflationary pressures in this key sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Outlook Turning to the outlook, although further unwinding of pandemic-related distortions should continue to put some downward pressure on inflation, restrictive monetary policy will likely play an increasingly important role. Getting inflation sustainably back down to 2 percent is expected to require a period of below-trend economic growth as well as some softening in labor market conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Economic growth Restrictive monetary policy has tightened financial conditions, supporting the expectation of below-trend growth. 5 Since last year's symposium, the two-year real yield is up about 250 basis points, and longer-term real yields are higher as wellâby nearly 150 basis points. 6 Beyond changes in interest rates, bank lending standards have tightened, and loan growth has slowed sharply. 7 Such a tightening of broad financial conditions typically contributes to a slowing in the growth of economic activity, and there is evidence of that in this cycle as well. For example, growth in industrial production has slowed, and the amount spent on residential investment has declined in each of the past five quarters ( figure 4 ).\n",
      "\n",
      "But we are attentive to signs that the economy may not be cooling as expected. So far this year, GDP (gross domestic product) growth has come in above expectations and above its longer-run trend, and recent readings on consumer spending have been especially robust. In addition, after decelerating sharply over the past 18 months, the housing sector is showing signs of picking back up. Additional evidence of persistently above-trend growth could put further progress on inflation at risk and could warrant further tightening of monetary policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The labor market The rebalancing of the labor market has continued over the past year but remains incomplete. Labor supply has improved, driven by stronger participation among workers aged 25 to 54 and by an increase in immigration back toward pre-pandemic levels. Indeed, the labor force participation rate of women in their prime working years reached an all-time high in June. Demand for labor has moderated as well. Job openings remain high but are trending lower. Payroll job growth has slowed significantly. Total hours worked has been flat over the past six months, and the average workweek has declined to the lower end of its pre-pandemic range, reflecting a gradual normalization in labor market conditions ( figure 5 ).\n",
      "\n",
      "This rebalancing has eased wage pressures. Wage growth across a range of measures continues to slow, albeit gradually ( figure 6 ). While nominal wage growth must ultimately slow to a rate that is consistent with 2 percent inflation, what matters for households is real wage growth. Even as nominal wage growth has slowed, real wage growth has been increasing as inflation has fallen.\n",
      "\n",
      "We expect this labor market rebalancing to continue. Evidence that the tightness in the labor market is no longer easing could also call for a monetary policy response.\n",
      "\n",
      "Uncertainty and Risk Management along the Path Forward Two percent is and will remain our inflation target. We are committed to achieving and sustaining a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to that level over time. It is challenging, of course, to know in real time when such a stance has been achieved. There are some challenges that are common to all tightening cycles. For example, real interest rates are now positive and well above mainstream estimates of the neutral policy rate. We see the current stance of policy as restrictive, putting downward pressure on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. But we cannot identify with certainty the neutral rate of interest, and thus there is always uncertainty about the precise level of monetary policy restraint.\n",
      "\n",
      "That assessment is further complicated by uncertainty about the duration of the lags with which monetary tightening affects economic activity and especially inflation. Since the symposium a year ago, the Committee has raised the policy rate by 300 basis points, including 100 basis points over the past seven months. And we have substantially reduced the size of our securities holdings. The wide range of estimates of these lags suggests that there may be significant further drag in the pipeline.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond these traditional sources of policy uncertainty, the supply and demand dislocations unique to this cycle raise further complications through their effects on inflation and labor market dynamics. For example, so far, job openings have declined substantially without increasing unemploymentâa highly welcome but historically unusual result that appears to reflect large excess demand for labor. In addition, there is evidence that inflation has become more responsive to labor market tightness than was the case in recent decades. 8 These changing dynamics may or may not persist, and this uncertainty underscores the need for agile policymaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "These uncertainties, both old and new, complicate our task of balancing the risk of tightening monetary policy too much against the risk of tightening too little. Doing too little could allow above-target inflation to become entrenched and ultimately require monetary policy to wring more persistent inflation from the economy at a high cost to employment. Doing too much could also do unnecessary harm to the economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion As is often the case, we are navigating by the stars under cloudy skies. In such circumstances, risk-management considerations are critical. At upcoming meetings, we will assess our progress based on the totality of the data and the evolving outlook and risks. Based on this assessment, we will proceed carefully as we decide whether to tighten further or, instead, to hold the policy rate constant and await further data. Restoring price stability is essential to achieving both sides of our dual mandate. We will need price stability to achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will keep at it until the job is done.\n",

      "3. This slowing in rent growth has likely occurred for a combination of reasons. Some of it likely reflects higher interest rates and the softening in real household income growth over the past couple of years. But the normalization of dislocations due to the pandemic is likely playing a role here as well. For example, the shifts in housing preferences related to working from home likely contributed to the increase in housing demand reflected in the sizable earlier increases in rents. As the price effects of that demand shift played out, the growth rate of rents would naturally decline toward its earlier trend. Finally, multifamily construction is quite high by historical standards, and that supply coming on line has likely also taken some pressure off market rents. Return to text\n",

      "8. The relationship between labor market slack and inflation, often called the Phillips curve relationship, is likely nonlinear, steepening in a tight labor market. If the Phillips curve has steepened in this way, a small change in labor market tightness could result in a more substantial change in inflation. It is difficult to know with precision how steep that relationship is in real time or how it might evolve as labor market tightness changes.

      "Corporate debt as a potential amplifier in a slowdown\n",
      "March 05, 2019\n",
      "As a central bank policymaker, I closely monitor various types of excesses and imbalances that may be developing in the economy. One of the areas I monitor is the level and growth of indebtedness in the household, government and corporate sectors. In previous essays , I have commented on the positive impacts of the deleveraging of the household sector since the Great Recession, and I have raised a cautionary flag regarding the growth of U.S. government debt, including a substantial increase in the present value of unfunded entitlements.\n",
      "The purpose of this essay is to focus on trends in corporate debt growth and credit quality in the U.S. and discuss potential implications for economic conditions and financial stability.\n",
      "Background on indebtedness in the U.S.\n",
      "In the decade since the Great Recession, there has been an improvement in household balance sheets. In particular, it is estimated that household debt declined from 97 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) at year-end 2008 to approximately 75 percent as of Sept. 30, 2018. [1] This trend has been aided by a strong jobs market and improving wage growth. This household deleveraging is very important because consumer spending is approximately 70 percent of U.S. GDP. [2]\n",
      "While household balance sheets have improved, the U.S. government has become more highly indebted. Government debt (primarily in the form of Treasury obligations) held by the public as a percentage of GDP has grown from 44 percent at year-end 2008 to approximately 77 percent as of Dec. 31, 2018. [3] In addition, the present value of unfunded entitlements now stands at approximately $54 trillion. [4] This growing level of government debt as a percentage of GDP means, at a minimum, there is less capacity for infrastructure spending and other investments which might help build the productive capability of the U.S. economy. It also means that in the next downturn, there is likely to be less capacity for fiscal stimulus.\n",
      "Historically, the U.S. government has tended to reduce its degree of leverage when the economy is strong—that has not been the case this cycle. At the later stages of a long economic expansion, recent fiscal actions have had the impact of increasing government debt to GDP and have provided meaningful stimulus to near-term growth. It is our view at the Dallas Fed that the current path of government debt to GDP is unlikely to be sustainable—and if we need to find ways to moderate our debt growth in the future, this moderation is likely to create headwinds for GDP growth.\n",
      "In addition to household and government debt, Dallas Fed economists also keep track of the level and growth of corporate debt in the financial sector as well as the nonfinancial sector of the U.S. economy. On the positive side, U.S. financial sector debt has declined substantially from near its historical peak of approximately 124 percent of GDP at the end of 2008 to 78 percent as of Sept. 30, 2018. [5] This decline was accompanied by substantially more stringent postcrisis financial sector regulations and oversight intended to reduce the systemic risk and improve the resiliency of the U.S. financial sector.\n",
      "By contrast, U.S. nonfinancial corporate debt as a percentage of GDP is now higher than the prior peak reached at the end of 2008. As seen in Chart 1, U.S. nonfinancial corporate debt as a percentage of GDP declined substantially in the aftermath of the Great Recession, but then rebounded from a postrecession low of approximately 40 percent in 2010 to 46 percent as of Sept. 30, 2018. [6] , [7]\n",
      "Downloadable chart\n",
      "This rebound in the amount of nonfinancial corporate debt is something I am carefully considering in assessing economic conditions and financial stability in the U.S. In particular, it is worth noting that a number of research studies have indicated that relatively higher levels of corporate debt to GDP could potentially amplify the severity of a recession. [8] Several of these papers also suggest that strong growth in corporate debt to GDP is more likely to amplify a downturn when corporate leverage is historically elevated, as it is today. [9]\n",
      "Trends in nonfinancial corporate debt\n",
      "Nonfinancial corporate debt consists primarily of bonds and loans (commercial paper outstanding is less than 5 percent of the total). Nonfinancial corporate bonds outstanding in the U.S. grew from approximately $2.2 trillion in 2008 to approximately $5.7 trillion at year-end 2018 ( Chart 2 ). The bulk of this growth occurred in the investment-grade sector. The amount of outstanding U.S. investment-grade nonfinancial corporate bonds grew from approximately $1.5 trillion in 2008 to $4.5 trillion at year-end 2018. [10]\n",
      "Within the investment-grade sector, there was a notable increase in the amount of BBB bonds (the lowest level of investment-grade debt) outstanding, growing from approximately $0.8 trillion in 2008 to $2.7 trillion by year-end 2018. [11] In addition, the amount of high-yield (less than investment grade) nonfinancial corporate bonds outstanding grew from approximately $0.7 trillion in 2008 to $1.1 trillion by year-end 2018. This substantial growth in BBB and lower-rated bonds is indicative of a weakening in corporate credit quality in the U.S.\n",
      "It is estimated that a substantial portion of the increase in nonfinancial corporate debt was used to fund share buybacks, dividends and merger activity. [12] This trend has been accompanied by more relaxed bond and loan covenants, [13] which have had the effect of reducing protections for investors. Downloadable chart There has also been an increase in syndicated leveraged loans over this period. Leveraged loans are loans made to highly indebted companies and are typically originated by commercial banks and then syndicated to nonbank investors, including special-purpose vehicles such as collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), private equity funds and other stand-alone entities. The size of the syndicated leveraged loan market, which is primarily made up of nonfinancial corporate borrowers, has increased from $0.6 trillion at the end of 2008 to $1.2 trillion at year-end 2018. [14] Much of this increase has occurred to fund corporate acquisitions and private-equity-backed transactions. [15] In addition to the syndicated leveraged loan market, there is also a direct lending market for leveraged loans in the U.S. This market primarily involves nonbank financial firms—such as asset managers, private equity funds, business development corporations (BDCs), hedge funds, insurance companies and pension funds—lending directly to smaller, mid-market companies. While it is difficult to obtain precise information on the size of this market, Standard and Poor’s (S&P) estimates that the amount of outstanding leveraged loans in the U.S. direct lending market has grown significantly over the past several years and now likely exceeds several hundred billion dollars. [16] CLO structure CLOs are investment vehicles that buy pools of floating-rate leveraged loans from banks. The CLO packages loans into tranches of debt with credit ratings ranging from AAA to BB and with one nonrated tranche of equity, as illustrated in Chart 3. These tranches are securitized and then sold primarily to institutional investors. Downloadable chart The ability of a CLO to turn lower-credit-quality loans into mostly investment-grade-rated bonds via securitization hinges on three key factors: 1) overcollateralization, 2) tranching of securities based on levels of subordination, and 3) portfolio diversification. As loans are paid off, the income flows to the buyers of the CLO securities. In case of a default in one of the underlying loans, the lowest tranche (equity) is the first to experience a loss, whereas the AAA tranche would be the last to experience a loss. Unlike mortgage-backed securities, the CLO structure proved relatively resilient during 2008–09. The U.S. CLO market has grown from roughly $300 billion at the end of 2008 to $615 billion at the end of 2018. [17] However, it is important to recognize that CLO loan-credit quality today is estimated to be somewhat weaker than 10 years ago. S&P estimates that in 2018, CLOs and loan mutual funds purchased approximately 60 percent and 20 percent, respectively, of syndicated leveraged loan volumes. It is estimated that less than 10 percent of new issuance was purchased by banks in the U.S. The remaining volumes were purchased by insurance companies, finance companies and others. [18] Because CLOs are today the largest buyer of these syndicated leveraged loans, disruptions to CLO creation could increase the likelihood that leveraged loans remain on bank balance sheets, which could, in turn, limit the ability of affected banks to extend credit during periods of stress. Implications of rising levels of BBB and less-than-investment-grade corporate debt As a central banker, I am carefully tracking the growth in BBB and less-than-investment-grade debt. In the event of a downturn, highly indebted companies may be more vulnerable to seeing their credit quality deteriorate, which could negatively impact their capital spending and hiring plans. If this deterioration were sufficiently widespread, credit spreads would likely widen in order to compensate lenders/bondholders for greater risk. This type of widening would likely be indicative of an overall tightening in financial conditions that could, in turn, lead to a more significant slowing in the economy. In a downturn, some proportion of BBB bonds may be at risk of being downgraded to less than investment grade. These downgrades, if they happen in sufficient size, could create dislocations for investors who tend to have specific allocations or restrictions based on credit-rating categories. These dislocations could further negatively impact credit spreads and market access for more highly indebted companies. Market liquidity One further issue is whether there is sufficient liquidity in the various corporate debt markets. Ample liquidity is particularly important in the event of market stress or dislocation. While there is debate regarding the evidence of a decline in various measures of corporate bond market liquidity—such as round-trip trading costs, bid–ask spreads or turnover [19] —it is generally agreed that bank-affiliated broker-dealers have been committing less capital to corporate bond trading since the financial crisis. In particular, it is estimated that inventories of corporate debt held by broker-dealers declined from $29.2 billion at the end of 2013 to $14.2 billion at the end of 2018. [20] This decline is notable given that the total corporate bond market increased 36 percent over this period. The decline in inventories held by broker-dealers may be due, at least in part, to postcrisis regulation, such as the Volcker rule (effective April 2014), as well as the growth in electronic trading and other market-related factors. [21] In the event of an economic downturn and some credit-quality deterioration, the reduction in bank broker-dealer inventories and market-making capability could mean that credit spreads might widen more significantly, and potentially in a more volatile manner, than they have historically. This concern may be somewhat heightened in light of the rapid growth in BBB and lower-rated securities issuance over the past 10 years. Conclusion: Continued Vigilance I will continue to closely monitor the level, growth and credit quality of corporate debt. Vigilance is warranted as these issues have the potential to impact corporate investment and spending plans. In the event of an economic downturn, these issues could also contribute to a deterioration in financial conditions which could, in turn, amplify the severity of a growth slowdown in the U.S. economy. I am also sensitive to these corporate debt developments in light of the historically high level of U.S. government debt and the forward estimates for the path of government debt to GDP. An elevated level of corporate debt, along with the high level of U.S. government debt, is likely to mean that the U.S. economy is much more interest rate sensitive than it has been historically.

      "Currently, we find ourselves in the midst of a serious recession—one that appears headed towards an experience more like the large downturns in the 1970s and 1980s than the moderate contractions of 1990 and 2001. Today I will discuss the events that brought us to this point, the outlook for the economy, and the policy challenges confronting the Fed during these troubling times. I should note that these are, of course, my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n",
      "\n",
      "Background\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the past 18 months the economy has experienced deteriorating housing markets, large-scale disruptions to our financial services industry, and plummeting consumer and business confidence. These and related developments have resulted in a significant decline in overall spending and production and a rise in the unemployment rate, particularly over the past six months. All of this has occurred despite aggressive actions by the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to address difficulties in credit markets and bolster aggregate demand. And as you know, Congress has been working on a fiscal stimulus package, and the Treasury has recommended new proposals to deal with the financial sector problems. I will touch more on these later.\n",
      "\n",
      "These certainly are challenging, if not extraordinary, times. How did we get here?\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2007 housing prices peaked, mortgage defaults rose, and strains began to appear in the market for securitized mortgages. The problems in mortgages spilled over to other segments of our financial markets. Market participants re-assessed risk, and the prices of many assets declined. This cascading process of re-pricing had a detrimental impact on the liquidity and capital positions of a wide range of financial institutions in the United States and around the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the spring and summer of 2008, the tightening of credit conditions had begun to weigh on business spending. And by the fall, household spending was affected as well. Spending was also reduced by the protracted weakness in housing markets, declines in financial wealth, softening labor markets, and substantial increases in prices for energy and other commodities. These factors contributed to a contraction in gross domestic product (GDP) beginning in the third quarter of 2008.\n",
      "\n",
      "A series of solvency and liquidity events also occurred during this period. Many financial firms reported severe losses, with big names like Bear Stearns, Wachovia, Washington Mutual, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, and American International Group (AIG) all on the list. Some of these firms appeared unable to survive on their own and were purchased by other financial institutions. In the case of Bear Sterns, this involved assistance from the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve and the Treasury also were able to arrange loans and guarantees to AIG in order to avoid large-scale disruptions in markets that had exposures to credit default swaps written by AIG. In contrast, when Lehman Brothers experienced especially large losses last September, no sale or loan support could be made at suitable terms. As a result, they went into bankruptcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "These developments intensified financial market participants' concerns over the potential losses on a range of assets as well as the ability of their counterparties to meet contractual obligations. One important sector that was disrupted was the money market fund industry. Money funds are major suppliers of financing to the commercial paper and other short-term credit markets. Worried over losses, investors in money market funds began making redemptions. To meet these, some funds had to liquidate assets into an already depressed market, further lowering the prices of these instruments.\n",
      "\n",
      "This process resulted in a marked increase in the cost of issuing all but the safest, shortest maturity of debt that usually rolls through these markets. Even highly rated firms have found it more difficult and expensive to obtain financing. Some have been able to tap bank backup lines of credit. But this substitution just pushes the funding difficulties back into the banking system, squeezing out the ability of banks to make other loans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Actions by the Federal Reserve\n",
      "\n",
      "In response to these extraordinary events, the Fed has implemented a number of policies aimed at mitigating the problems in the financial system and their potential fallout on the rest of the economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the Fed turned to its traditional principal monetary policy instrument, the federal funds rate. Since September 2007, the Federal Open Market Committee has lowered the target funds rate 525 basis points, bringing it to essentially zero in December of last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the corresponding injections of broad liquidity helped credit conditions somewhat, it became clear early on that more had to be done to facilitate market functioning.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first, we simply made a number of adjustments to make it more attractive for banks to borrow from the discount window—which is the traditional way the Fed lends overnight to depository institutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the events of 2008—in which all types of institutions faced liquidity shortfalls—the Fed created a number of facilities to directly provide liquidity to nondepository institutions; the Federal Reserve Act grants us such emergency powers when the economy is faced with \"unusual and exigent circumstances.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of these facilities have been aimed at the functioning of short-term credit markets. Some lend to broker-dealers that engage in securities transactions with the Fed and have a large-scale presence in short-term funding markets such as the repo market. Others provide a liquidity backstop for commercial paper issuers and facilitate the sale in secondary markets of a number of instruments held by money market funds. As such, these facilities are lending at relatively short maturities—generally not more than 90 days.\n",
      "\n",
      "More recent Fed actions, however, have taken some longer-term assets onto our balance sheet. In December, we began purchasing debt obligations and mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs). This initiative will help support the flow of credit and lower borrowing costs in mortgage markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, the Federal Reserve has not been alone in dealing with the crisis. The FDIC increased deposit insurance limits and began to offer insurance on some liabilities of eligible depository institutions and financial holding companies. Congress enacted the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, which authorized the Treasury Department's Troubled Assets Relief Program, (or TARP). This program has so far provided more than $335 billion in capital injections to the financial system to support the lending capacity of banks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just yesterday, Treasury Secretary Geithner outlined the Financial Stability Plan. One element of the plan is aimed at valuing illiquid assets and moving them off of banks' balance sheets. By doing so, this should attract more private capital and ease balance sheet restrictions on banks' lending capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have seen a number of indications that the traditional easing of monetary policy and the nontraditional policy actions are beginning to help the functioning of credit markets and reduce financial strains. The spreads on the interest rates charged for interbank lending and on commercial paper relative to the fed funds rate have come down appreciably since October, particularly at the one-month maturity. $156 billion of debt has been issued with FDIC guarantees, facilitating medium-term funding by eligible financial institutions. And the rates on conforming mortgages relative to Treasury bonds have declined since the Fed's GSE purchase program was announced.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, market disruptions clearly remain, and most spreads between private lending rates and comparable-maturity risk-free government debt are still quite elevated relative to where they were before the crisis. Of course, we would not expect spreads and other lending terms to return to those prevailing before the crisis—a period when risk was clearly underpriced. Nevertheless, current spreads and terms seem to be well above where the \"new normal\" will end up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the longer run, we will reach the \"new normal.\" Policy actions and the work being done in the private sector to reassess risks and shore up balance sheets will help move us back toward something resembling financial stability. This will not be an easy process, and it could take time before financial markets function in a manner that fully facilitates the activities of businesses and households. Until they do, we will continue to experience some drag on activity in the nonfinancial sectors of the economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Economic Outlook\n",
      "\n",
      "As we know only too well, the economy currently is contracting at a disturbing pace. Labor markets have deteriorated significantly. The unemployment rate was 4.9 percent when the recession started in December 2007; last month it reached 7.6 percent. Weak labor markets have held back growth in real incomes, and further declines in the stock-market and homes prices have led to marked reductions in household wealth. Slowing foreign activity and the higher dollar are reducing demand for our exports. Although there has been a modest improvement in some credit conditions, overall they still remain tight. The more pessimistic outlook for the economy has reduced everyone's confidence. In turn, we've seen a further pullback in risk-taking by investors, households, and businesses. They are particularly reluctant to take on longer-term investment or spending commitments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Together, these factors have led to sharp drop offs in business investment, industrial production, and household spending. Overall output, as measured by real GDP, fell at a 0.5 percent annual rate in the third quarter of 2008 and then dropped at a 3.8 percent rate in the fourth quarter. Last quarter business fixed investment declined at a 19 percent annualized rate, residential investment fell at a 22.4 percent rate, and consumer spending dropped at a 3.5 percent pace. These are very large declines—on par with those experienced during the recessions of the mid-1970s and early 1980s.\n",
      "\n",
      "The factors that produced the sharp decline in output in the second half of last year are still in play today. Consequently, I expect real GDP will fall markedly in the first half of 2009. I am currently projecting that GDP will begin to expand some later in 2009, but not enough to offset the declines in the first half of the year. In part, this expected pickup reflects the support from both traditional and nontraditional monetary policies, fiscal actions already taken to address the strains in financial markets, and progress that financial markets themselves make in working through their difficulties. In addition, the new fiscal stimulus package will boost output. However, its full size and impact are still unclear, and our forecast could need some recalibration as we gain knowledge on how the package is affecting the economy. Looking out a bit further, I expect the pace of GDP growth to move back up in the neighborhood of potential as we move through 2010. However, I do not see growth as being strong enough to make much progress in closing resource gaps over this period. Indeed, the unemployment rate—the main resource gap measure in the labor market—is likely to rise into 2010.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the inflation front, headline consumer prices have fallen in recent months, and core prices—which exclude the volatile food and energy categories—have changed little. This appreciable reduction in inflationary pressures reflects falling prices for energy and other commodities, declines in import prices, and the increase in resource slack due to diminished economic activity. Looking ahead, futures markets expect some increase in energy prices. However, substantial resource slack and the likelihood of some moderate reduction in inflation expectations should hold back overall price increases. Consequently, I expect additional slowing in core consumer price inflation in 2009 and a further edging down in 2010. Over the longer-run, with appropriate monetary policy, I see both overall and core inflation averaging somewhere into the neighborhood of 2 percent, which is a rate I see as being consistent with price stability. That said, there is notable risk that inflation will remain a good deal below this range in the medium term.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some Perspectives on Policy\n",
      "\n",
      "I am now going to turn to some broader perspectives on the policy picture. The traditional monetary policy action used to combat sluggish economic activity is to lower the fed funds rate. This in turn reduces other borrowing rates and thus stimulates aggregate demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "In December the FOMC decided to move the funds rate to near zero and two weeks ago we voted to leave it unchanged. With the fed funds rate near zero, we cannot lower it any further. Yet, clearly, the recession, financial distress, and low inflationary pressures call for more policy accommodation. For the Fed, this means that the Committee will have to focus on other ways to impart monetary stimulus to the economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "One way that monetary policy influences financial and economic activity is through the clarity of our intentions and communications. Expectations of likely future outcomes, including those for monetary policy, obviously matter for decisions made by households and businesses today. In this vein, at a time when near-term inflation is likely to be lower than usual, endorsing an explicit numerical objective for inflation could help keep inflation expectations from falling very far. Such an anchor on inflation expectations would help preserve low real inflation-adjusted interest rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way to increase monetary accommodation is to work to bring down unusual liquidity and risk premia that are raising private and longer-term borrowing costs. As I discussed earlier, the Federal Reserve has already operated in this arena, adopting a number of nonstandard policies that are providing liquidity support to a range of institutions and markets. And, if necessary, such nontraditional tools can be expanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this regard, in November we announced another joint program with the Treasury, called the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF. And yesterday the Fed announced it is prepared to undertake a substantial expansion of the TALF. Although not yet operational, the TALF should be up and running soon. This temporary facility is designed to support the demand for asset-backed securities by reducing the likelihood that future liquidity needs could force investors to sell into a depressed market. Holders of securities that are bundles of student, consumer, and small businesses loans can borrow from the TALF, using the securities themselves as collateral. Other asset-backed securities, such as commercial mortgage-backed securities, could also be eligible. The terms on these loans are more costly than those seen during more normal times. Thus TALF loans eventually will become unattractive when conditions improve in markets for traditional sources of funding. Large haircuts on the collateral and TARP funds provide the Fed with credit protection on the facility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another feature of the TALF is that its loans are for three years—medium-term loans that are noticeably longer than at our other lending facilities. So, like our GSE purchases, it can directly affect interest rates further out on the yield curve.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also note that, as conditions warrant, we will be expanding existing programs. In addition, we are considering the purchase of longer-term Treasury securities, if evolving circumstances indicate that such transactions would be particularly effective in improving conditions in private credit markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "A common question I hear is: \"What principles guide the implementation of these new initiatives?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me step back for a second and discuss these programs at a more conceptual level. In a well-functioning financial system, arbitrage moves funds across markets and balances out profit opportunities. It thus aligns term and risk-adjusted returns across markets. This is the reason, for example, why our typical moves to lower the short-term risk-free federal funds rate affect borrowing rates over a large range of maturity and risk structures. In such an environment, we can focus on the size of the liquidity injection instead of the particular segment of the market in which the injection occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that is not the case today. There is abundant evidence that arbitrage opportunities remain unexploited. Due to balance-sheet capacity limitations, or because uncertainty and risk aversion are so much higher than normal, participants are largely avoiding markets that are undergoing unusual stress. For example, many student loan payments are guaranteed by the federal government. Despite the guarantees, liquidity disruptions have all but shut down the auction rate security markets that student loan providers had used to obtain a good deal of their funding. Subsequently, they have had substantial difficulty in attracting investors to other types of securities backed by student loans.\n",
      "\n",
      "One way of thinking about these developments is that markets have become highly segmented. We do not see funds flowing in to take advantage of apparent profit opportunities with respect to distressed assets. Such an action could ease liquidity pressures in these sectors and help keep some problems from spilling over into solvency concerns.\n",
      "\n",
      "The flip side of this segmentation is that liquidity injections aimed directly at a particular distressed market are less likely to leak out to other areas. The injections thus hold open the possibility of improving that market's functioning a good deal, seeding its transition to more normal liquidity and risk valuations. This is the rationale for why our nontraditional policies focus on loans and securities that affect transactions in particular key markets where we see points of stress. But a downside is that markets outside of this segment could experience stress because of the separation.\n",
      "\n",
      "As stressed markets improve, more normal functioning of the financial system as whole can be achieved. Financial firms will become more willing to carry on their usual arbitrage activities, and market segmentation will diminish. As such, both the need and effectiveness of the special programs will diminish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because segmentation will change dynamically, the effectiveness and unintended consequences of credit policies can shift over time and in unexpected ways. This highlights the need for careful design and continuous monitoring of these programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "More generally, as economic activity recovers and financial conditions normalize, the use of nontraditional policy tools and the size of the Fed's balance sheet will be reduced, and the FOMC will return to its traditional focus on the federal funds rate. Some of this wind-down will occur naturally as market conditions improve, given the particular pricing and maturity design features of these programs. Still, financial market participants need to be prepared for the eventual dismantling of the facilities that have been put in place during the financial turmoil. Fortunately, it is most likely that this dismantling would be associated with better economic and financial performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "To conclude, the U.S. economy faces many challenges. The Fed has been proactive in addressing market liquidity stresses during the financial crisis—first by using our traditional monetary policy tools and later through our nontraditional lending facilities. Moving forward, we will be vigilant in monitoring the risks to growth and price stability. It is also important for us to continue to collaborate with policymakers throughout government and across the globe in the pursuit of financial stability worldwide. We likely are in for a protracted period of poor economic performance. But the policy actions taken by the Fed and other governmental agencies over the course of the financial crisis, and the efforts of the private sector to work through its difficulties, will eventually help support a recovery in economic growth.\n",

      "Good afternoon! Thank you so much  for that introduction. It’s great to be here with this group —  and as much as I’d like to have been there in person, it’s pretty great that I  didn’t have to fight the traffic on I-95. I’m really looking forward to our discussion today.\n",
      "\n",
      "My plan is to talk about where we  are economically and then to share some of the Philadelphia Fed’s research on  housing that I think will be of particular interest to this group. Then we can  open things up for a Q&A.\n",
      "\n",
      "But before we do any of that, I  need to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my  own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open  Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\n",
      "\n",
      "Economic Outlook\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe it’s the summer weather or  the fact that the Phillies are a couple of games ahead of the Nationals in the  NL East, but I’m pleased to note that there is a palpable sense of optimism as  we convene. (Just kidding about the Nats part!)\n",
      "\n",
      "COVID-19 cases have fallen to  levels not seen since the onset of the pandemic. Deaths are finally retreating  as well. After a truly painful 2020 and early part of 2021, things do seem to  be turning around.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout the pandemic, the  economy has largely tracked the path of the virus. And so as COVID-19 has  receded, the economy has picked up. Employment, housing, and manufacturing  figures came in stronger over the last couple of months than many of us —  myself included — expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "And recent spending data have once  again provided a reminder to never bet against the American consumer. Over the  past three months, consumer spending — a component of GDP comprising around 70  percent of the nation’s total economic output — has grown a healthy 2.7 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’re digging out of a very deep  hole — and we have a long way to go — but for now, I’m anticipating national  GDP growth to come in around 7 percent for 2021, before moderating to 3 percent  growth next year.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are, of course, downside  risks, including vaccination hesitancy that precludes true herd immunity as  well as the possibility of new COVID-19 variants that render the vaccines less  effective. As encouraging as these trends are, the pandemic is not yet over.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no doubt that the cash  Congress appropriated to Americans through the Paycheck Protection Program and  the more than $3,000 in direct payments to the majority of U.S. households has  helped buoy consumer spending during the pandemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some cases, that meant literal  cash — one of our contacts who owns a network of gas stations and convenience  stores reported needing extra armored car runs during the week that the latest  round of stimulus checks arrived to keep up with demand at his ATMs. Here at  the Fed, we’re also starting, once again, to deal with increased demand for  coins. So I hope there aren’t too many of you who need quarters to do your  laundry; it could be challenging for a while to find them  …\n",
      "\n",
      "Other Americans have socked away  what they’ve received. The household savings rate is up sharply, and in March,  it was at the second-highest rate on record — 27.7 percent. And others are  paying down debt at a rapid clip; bankers have told us that there are clearly  some who are struggling with loans and forbearance, but that many of their  clients are using this period to catch up on payments they may have fallen  behind on.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of this is setting the table  for a recovery that could be long and durable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, it’s very important to note  that the recovery in GDP has so far outpaced the rebound in the labor force.\n",
      "\n",
      "The level of employment is still  more than 8 million below the prepandemic peak, and that doesn’t account for  the roughly 200,000 in monthly gains we probably would have seen without  COVID-19. So in a sense, we’re really down around 11 million jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the economy continues to reopen,  I expect job creation to pick up in the coming months. Given current  trajectories, I anticipate the labor force returning to its prepandemic trend  sometime next summer — it will be a while, in other words.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are myriad reasons that the  employment rebound is slightly lagging other indicators.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some are salutary: During the  pandemic, firms became more productive and learned to do more with less. A more  productive economy benefits all of us in the long run.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what’s puzzling at first glance  is that the number of job openings is actually very high. We’ve all seen the  Help Wanted signs popping up just about everywhere. And I was just down at the  Jersey Shore and had a chance to chat with the manager of a local grocery  store. She told me she’s having a hard time finding anybody to work this  summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "What accounts for this? We’ve heard  from many employers who say that enhanced unemployment benefits are keeping  workers at home. If that’s truly a determinative factor, it will be short lived;  the extra benefits expire in September.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other people may have some  hesitancy about returning to the workplace until they get vaccinated and until they’re  convinced their coworkers are vaccinated. In my District, I know that many  people who commute by mass transit are hesitant about getting back on the bus  or train.\n",
      "\n",
      "And another factor that has driven  far too many talented people out of the workforce during the pandemic is a  dearth of childcare options.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a real economic cost that  all of us incur when people — and let’s be frank, mostly mothers — leave the  labor force because they can’t find an affordable option for taking care of  their kids during the workday.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Delaware, for instance, it now  costs the median-earning family 20 percent of their income to pay for the care  of a child under 5 years old. That’s a heavy burden — even before COVID-19  shuttered many schools and childcare centers, further straining families.\n",
      "\n",
      "Making childcare more affordable is  a complex issue but one that surely requires our attention. Already, one of the  most oft-cited reasons couples give for having fewer children than they say they  want is the cost of raising them.\n",
      "\n",
      "My colleagues at the Minneapolis  Fed have found that, at the outset of the pandemic, many parents of young  children left the labor force — 3.4 percent of fathers and 2.9 percent of  mothers dropped out altogether. But in the ensuing year, most fathers have  returned to the labor force, while the participation rate of mothers of young  children is still down 2.8 percentage points from before the pandemic. That is  a lot of human capital lying untapped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inflation and Fed Policy\n",
      "\n",
      "With the economy picking up and so  much fiscal support and monetary accommodation, there is some upside risk to  increased inflation. We will continue to monitor that closely. But for now, I’m  forecasting close to 3 percent headline inflation for 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the Fed, we’re planning to keep  the federal funds rate low for long, but it may be time to at least think about  thinking about tapering our $120 billion in monthly Treasury bond and  mortgage-backed securities purchases. This is not something we are going to do  suddenly, though. We need  to follow the playbook we had after the Great Recession; that is, start to  taper the bond purchases slowly. We will remove accommodation carefully and  methodically as the economy continues to strengthen.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may not make for exciting  speeches, but our goal here is to be boring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Research on Forbearance\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, before we move to the Q&A,  I would like to share some research from my colleagues at the Philadelphia Fed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m reminded of the old Saturday  Night Live joke about Rhode Island — neither a road nor an island —  and I know that not everybody in this group is a woman who works in housing or  finance. But I’m sure you’ll find it interesting and important.\n",
      "\n",
      "My colleagues in Philadelphia wanted  to get to the bottom of two important questions as we assess and seek to remedy  the damage wrought by the pandemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "First: What is the extent of racial  and income disparities among mortgage borrowers in nonpayment on their  mortgages, and how has the pandemic affected these disparities? Then, they  wanted to find out who took up forbearance on their mortgages and who missed  this important opportunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because the CARES Act mandates that  borrowers in forbearance who aren’t paying on their mortgages still be reported  to credit bureaus as if they are paying, these turned out to be surprisingly  tricky questions to answer. But through some quite clever methods —  my Philadelphia Fed colleagues are nothing if not ingenious —  the researchers were able to suss out the data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is what they found: Between  April and November 2020, minorities’ and lower-income borrowers’ nonpayment  rates were twice as high as for higher-income and White borrowers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if we compare borrowers with  the same credit score and the same loan type, Black and Hispanic borrowers have  more than 30 percent higher rates of nonpayment, and lower-income borrowers 50  percent higher. Moreover, and importantly, these disparities largely did not exist pre-COVID-19.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a sign that the CARES Act was  effective, my colleagues found that minority and lower-income borrowers took up  forbearances at significantly higher rates than other groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rub, of course, is that under  the CARES Act and subsequent extension from the Biden administration,  forbearance lasts only up to 18 months, meaning many borrowers will be coming  off soon. That’s concerning, given that as of mid-May, about 35 percent of  people who went into forbearance in the first place are still in it —  an estimated 2.2 million borrowers.\n",
      "\n",
      "That presents a challenge to  borrowers first and foremost, of course. But also to lenders. And my colleagues  suggest a possible solution to this problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "The proposed fix would extend the  term of the loan and reduce interest payments, for payment-reduction  modifications of 20 or 30 percent in total for those who have a high payment  burden and little equity in their house. In the case of a 20 percent reduction,  these modifications would cost lenders about $1.5 billion. For 30 percent  reductions, the cost would be $4.3 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The upshot? Only a fraction of the  costs of broader government-assistance programs enacted in 2020 and 2021 could  keep distressed borrowers in their homes. That strikes me as something worth  thinking hard about.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, thank you again for having me,  and now I’m happy to take some questions.\n"
